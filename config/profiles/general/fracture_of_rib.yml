  primary_diagnosis: Fracture of the 1st rib with suspected vascular injury
  presenting_complaint: Severe upper chest pain and numbness in the right arm after a fall from height
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old construction worker fell 3 metres, sustaining a fracture of the right 1st rib. Due to the high-energy nature of the injury and proximity to major vessels, a CT angiogram was performed, which fortunately ruled out subclavian artery damage. He was managed for neuropathic pain in the brachial plexus distribution and monitored for delayed vascular complications.

fracture_of_rib_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Rib fractures with massive haemothorax
  presenting_complaint: Hypotension and dullness to percussion on the right side following a crush injury
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male was pinned between two vehicles, sustaining multiple right-sided rib fractures. He presented in haemorrhagic shock, and a chest X-ray showed complete opacification of the right hemithorax. A chest tube drained 1,500ml of blood immediately; he was stabilized with a massive transfusion protocol and underwent urgent thoracotomy to control intercostal artery bleeding.

fracture_of_rib_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic rib fractures post-CPR
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral anterior chest wall bruising and crepitus following resuscitation
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male was successfully resuscitated following an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Post-ROSC (return of spontaneous circulation) chest X-ray revealed bilateral fractures of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th ribs and the sternum, consistent with high-quality chest compressions. Management was supportive, focusing on balancing analgesia with the patient's cardiovascular stability in the ICU.

fracture_of_rib_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic non-union of rib fracture
  presenting_complaint: Persistent "clicking" sensation and localized pain six months post-injury
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old heavy smoker had sustained a 7th rib fracture in a cycling accident six months prior.

  primary_diagnosis: Intercostal neuralgia post-rib fracture
  presenting_complaint: Burning, electric-shock-like pain along the distribution of the 5th intercostal nerve
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female experienced persistent neuropathic pain three months after a 5th rib fracture had radiologically healed. The pain was refractory to standard analgesics and interfered with her sleep. She was referred to the chronic pain clinic, where she was started on gabapentin and received an intercostal nerve block, which provided significant relief.

fracture_of_rib_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Occult rib fracture
  presenting_complaint: Persistent chest wall tenderness despite a normal initial X-ray
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male athlete presented with focal pain over the 6th rib following a collision. Initial PA and lateral chest X-rays were reported as normal. Due to ongoing symptoms and clinical suspicion, a dedicated rib series or CT was performed, revealing a minimally displaced fracture that was previously obscured by overlying soft tissue.

fracture_of_rib_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic rib fractures
  presenting_complaint: New sharp pain adjacent to an old injury site
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with previously healed fractures of the 5th and 6th ribs from a fall two years ago presented with new trauma. Imaging showed new fractures of the 7th and 8th ribs on the same side, with evidence of the old, well-consolidated fractures. Management was complicated by pre-existing pleural thickening, requiring careful titration of analgesia and monitoring of lung function.

fracture_of_rib_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Rib fracture with pulmonary contusion
  presenting_complaint: Haemoptysis and hypoxia following blunt chest trauma
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female was kicked in the chest by a horse, sustaining multiple fractures to the right 4th-7th ribs. Admission CT showed significant underlying pulmonary contusions without a pneumothorax. She was monitored closely for delayed respiratory failure, treated with high-flow oxygen and humidified air, and avoided mechanical ventilation through intensive chest physiotherapy.
