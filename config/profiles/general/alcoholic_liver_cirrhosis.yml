alcoholic_liver_cirrhosis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Decompensated alcoholic liver cirrhosis
  presenting_complaint: Increasing abdominal girth and yellowing of the eyes.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with a 20-year history of heavy alcohol intake presented with gross ascites and scleral icterus. Investigations showed bilirubin 85 µmol/L, albumin 24 g/L, and prolonged INR of 1.8. Ultrasound confirmed a nodular liver and portal hypertension; he was started on spironolactone and furosemide with moderate response.

alcoholic_liver_cirrhosis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Compensated alcoholic liver cirrhosis
  presenting_complaint: Routine health check-up; asymptomatic.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female was found to have mildly deranged LFTs (ALT 55 U/L, GGT 210 U/L) during a work medical. FibroScan revealed a liver stiffness of 18.5 kPa, consistent with F4 fibrosis. She was advised on total alcohol abstinence and enrolled in a 6-monthly HCC screening programme via ultrasound.

alcoholic_liver_cirrhosis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF)
  presenting_complaint: Haematemesis and melaena.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with known alcoholic cirrhosis presented in haemorrhagic shock following a massive variceal bleed. Despite successful endoscopic band ligation, he developed Grade 3 hepatic encephalopathy and acute kidney injury (AKI). He was managed in ICU with vasopressors and terlipressin but unfortunately succumbed to multi-organ failure.

alcoholic_liver_cirrhosis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic liver cirrhosis with Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP)
  presenting_complaint: Diffuse abdominal pain and low-grade fever.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old female with long-standing cirrhosis presented with sudden clinical deterioration and abdominal tenderness. Diagnostic paracentesis revealed a neutrophil count of 450 cells/mm³, confirming SBP. She was treated with IV cefotaxime and 20% human albumin solution, leading to a steady recovery and discharge on prophylactic ciprofloxacin.

alcoholic_liver_cirrhosis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic liver cirrhosis with Hepatic Encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, reversal of sleep-wake cycle, and tremors.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male was brought to A&E by family due to worsening disorientation and a "flapping" tremor (asterixis). Blood ammonia was significantly elevated at 120 µmol/L. He was treated with lactulose and rifaximin to reduce nitrogenous waste absorption, resulting in a return to his baseline mental state within 72 hours.

alcoholic_liver_cirrhosis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic liver cirrhosis with Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS)
  presenting_complaint: Reduced urine output and worsening peripheral oedema.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male with refractory ascites developed a rapid rise in serum creatinine to 210 µmol/L despite fluid resuscitation and withdrawal of diuretics. A diagnosis of Type 1 HRS was made. He was treated with terlipressin and albumin infusions, which improved renal perfusion and stabilised his creatinine levels.

alcoholic_liver_cirrhosis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic liver cirrhosis with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
  presenting_complaint: Unintentional weight loss and right upper quadrant pain.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with previously stable alcoholic cirrhosis presented with a 6kg weight loss over two months. Surveillance ultrasound and subsequent triple-phase CT identified a 4cm hypervascular lesion in segment VII with venous washout. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was elevated at 450 ng/mL, and he was referred for transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE).

alcoholic_liver_cirrhosis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic liver cirrhosis with Hepatopulmonary Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath that worsens when sitting upright (platypnoea).
  summary_of_course: A 49-year-old female with cirrhosis complained of progressive dyspnoea and orthodeoxia (oxygen desaturation upon standing). Contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography (bubble study) showed late appearance of microbubbles in the left atrium, confirming intrapulmonary shunting. She was commenced on long-term oxygen therapy while being assessed for liver transplantation.

alcoholic_liver_cirrhosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: End-stage alcoholic liver cirrhosis
  presenting_complaint: Intractable pruritus and severe malnutrition.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with Child-Pugh C cirrhosis presented with debilitating itching and significant sarcopenia. Clinical examination showed multiple spider naevi, palmar erythema, and profound muscle wasting. Due to multiple comorbidities and continued alcohol use, he was deemed unsuitable for transplant and transitioned to a palliative care pathway focusing on symptom control.

alcoholic_liver_cirrhosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic liver cirrhosis with portal hypertensive gastropathy
  presenting_complaint: Chronic fatigue and exertional dyspnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female was found to have a microcytic anaemia (Hb 8.2 g/dL, Ferritin 8 µg/L). OGD revealed a "snake-skin" appearance of the gastric mucosa consistent with portal hypertensive gastropathy but no active varices. She was treated with oral iron supplements and non-selective beta-blockers (propranolol) to reduce portal pressures.

alcoholic_liver_cirrhosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic liver cirrhosis with severe coagulopathy
  presenting_complaint: Spontaneous bruising and prolonged bleeding from the gums.
  summary_of_course: A 56-year-old male presented with extensive ecchymoses across his torso. Laboratory tests showed a platelet count of 42 x 10⁹/L and an INR of 2.1, reflecting impaired hepatic synthetic function and hypersplenism. He was managed conservatively with Vitamin K injections, although the primary driver remained his underlying alcoholic cirrhosis.

alcoholic_liver_cirrhosis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic liver cirrhosis with refractory ascites
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent abdominal tension despite high-dose diuretics.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male required large-volume paracentesis (LVP) every 2 weeks for symptomatic relief of ascites. Despite maximal doses of spironolactone (400mg) and furosemide (160mg), his urine sodium remained low. He was eventually referred for a Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) procedure to manage the portal hypertension.

alcoholic_liver_cirrhosis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic liver cirrhosis with umbilical hernia rupture
  presenting_complaint: Leaking fluid from the umbilicus (Flood syndrome).
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with massive ascites presented with a sudden "pop" at his umbilical site followed by the drainage of clear peritoneal fluid. This rare complication of cirrhosis carries a high risk of peritonitis. He underwent emergency surgical repair of the hernia and aggressive management of his ascites to prevent recurrence.

alcoholic_liver_cirrhosis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic liver cirrhosis with secondary haemochromatosis
  presenting_complaint: Skin hyperpigmentation and joint pain.
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old male with a history of heavy cider consumption presented with a "bronzed" skin appearance. Iron studies showed a transferrin saturation of 85% and ferritin of 1800 µg/L. Liver biopsy confirmed micronodular cirrhosis with significant haemosiderin deposition in Kupffer cells, likely exacerbated by the iron content in his chosen alcohol.

alcoholic_liver_cirrhosis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Early-onset alcoholic liver cirrhosis
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice and anorexia in a young adult.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female with a 10-year history of spirit dependency presented with deep jaundice (bilirubin 310 µmol/L). Clinical assessment and imaging confirmed established cirrhosis with superimposed severe alcoholic hepatitis (Maddrey’s Discriminant Function 52). She was treated with a course of prednisolone and intensive nutritional support.

alcoholic_liver_cirrhosis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic liver cirrhosis with Portosystemic Encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of seizures and agitation.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male with known cirrhosis was admitted following a tonic-clonic seizure. While initially suspected to be alcohol withdrawal, his ammonia was 150 µmol/L and EEG showed triphasic waves. It was determined that a recent high-protein binge and constipation had precipitated a severe episode of hepatic encephalopathy.

alcoholic_liver_cirrhosis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic liver cirrhosis with Hydrothorax
  presenting_complaint: Persistent dry cough and right-sided chest heaviness.
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old female with minimal ascites presented with significant respiratory distress. Chest X-ray showed a large right-sided pleural effusion; thoracocentesis confirmed a transudate with similar biochemistry to peritoneal fluid. This hepatic hydrothorax was managed with salt restriction and increased diuretics, avoiding the need for a chest drain.

alcoholic_liver_cirrhosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic liver cirrhosis (Incidental surgical finding)
  presenting_complaint: Elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstones.
  summary_of_course: A 53-year-old male underwent surgery for symptomatic cholelithiasis. Intraoperatively, the surgeon noted a "cobblestone" appearance of the liver and a wedge biopsy was performed. Histopathology confirmed alcoholic micronodular cirrhosis, despite the patient previously under-reporting his alcohol consumption (40 units/week).

alcoholic_liver_cirrhosis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic liver cirrhosis with Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and severe memory deficits.
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male with advanced cirrhosis was admitted after being found collapsed. He exhibited nystagmus and profound confabulation. He was treated with high-dose IV thiamine (Pabrinex) for Wernicke’s encephalopathy, but he was left with permanent cognitive impairment (Korsakoff’s psychosis) alongside his liver disease.

alcoholic_liver_cirrhosis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic liver cirrhosis with congestive splenomegaly
  presenting_complaint: Left-sided abdominal fullness and early satiety.
  summary_of_course: A 46-year-old male with a history of alcohol misuse presented with discomfort in the left hypochondrium. Examination revealed a palpable spleen 5cm below the costal margin. Bloods showed a sequestration-related pancytopenia (WBC 2.8, Hb 10.5, Plt 55), and imaging confirmed cirrhosis with significant splenomegaly and gastric varices.
