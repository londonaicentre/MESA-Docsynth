spinal_stenosis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral leg pain and heaviness exacerbated by walking
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male presented with a 2-year history of neurogenic claudication, relieved by sitting or leaning forward. MRI revealed severe central canal narrowing at L4/5 due to ligamentum flavum hypertrophy and facet joint arthropathy. He underwent a course of conservative management including physiotherapy and epidural steroid injections with moderate symptomatic relief.

spinal_stenosis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute cauda equina syndrome secondary to spinal stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset saddle anaesthesia and urinary retention
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female with known chronic low back pain presented acutely to A&E with new-onset bowel dysfunction and perianal numbness. Urgent MRI confirmed acute-on-chronic stenosis at L5/S1 with a large sequestered disc fragment causing severe compression. She underwent emergency surgical decompression within 6 hours, resulting in partial recovery of bladder function at 6-month follow-up.

spinal_stenosis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Cervical spinal stenosis with myelopathy
  presenting_complaint: Progressive loss of fine motor skills and gait instability
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male reported difficulty buttoning shirts and frequent stumbles over the past 6 months. Clinical examination revealed hyperreflexia, a positive Hoffmann's sign, and a wide-based gait. MRI demonstrated multi-level cervical stenosis (C3-C6) with cord signal changes (oedema) on T2-weighted imaging, necessitating an urgent posterior cervical decompression and fusion.

spinal_stenosis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Congenital lumbar spinal stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic lower limb parasthesia in a young adult
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old male with achondroplasia presented with progressive leg weakness and exercise intolerance. Radiographs and MRI confirmed developmentally short pedicles leading to a narrow spinal canal across the entire lumbar spine. Due to the severity of symptoms and risk of neurological deficit, he was referred for elective multi-level laminectomies.

spinal_stenosis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Foraminal spinal stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent unilateral L5 radiculopathy
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female presented with sharp, shooting pain radiating down her left leg to the dorsum of the foot. Unlike central stenosis, her pain was constant and not strictly posture-dependent. MRI identified severe left-sided neural foraminal narrowing at L5/S1 due to a combination of disc protrusion and osteophyte formation, which was successfully treated with a targeted nerve root block.

spinal_stenosis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent spinal stenosis post-laminectomy
  presenting_complaint: Return of neurogenic claudication 5 years after surgery
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male who previously underwent L3-L5 decompression presented with a recurrence of symptoms. Imaging showed adjacent segment disease with new-grade stenosis at L2/3 and significant scar tissue formation at the previous surgical site. He was managed through a multidisciplinary pain programme including neuropathic medications after being deemed a high-risk candidate for revision surgery.

spinal_stenosis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild asymptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding on abdominal imaging
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female underwent an MRI of the abdomen for investigation of renal cysts, which incidentally noted mild degenerative narrowing of the spinal canal at L4/5. The patient was completely asymptomatic with no history of back or leg pain. No intervention was required, and she was advised on core strengthening and weight management to prevent future progression.

spinal_stenosis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Central cord syndrome due to cervical stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Acute upper limb weakness following a minor fall
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with pre-existing asymptomatic cervical stenosis sustained a low-energy fall hitting his forehead. He presented with disproportionately greater motor weakness in the upper limbs compared to the lower limbs and sensory loss below the neck. Urgent MRI showed a hyperextension injury on a background of severe C4-C7 stenosis, requiring ICU admission for haemodynamic monitoring and subsequent stabilisation surgery.

spinal_stenosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Tandem spinal stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Simultaneous neck pain and neurogenic claudication
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old female presented with complex neurological symptoms involving both upper limb clumsiness and lower limb heaviness while walking. Investigations confirmed significant stenosis in both the cervical (C5/6) and lumbar (L4/5) regions. The surgical team prioritised the cervical decompression to prevent permanent myelopathic damage before addressing the lumbar symptoms.

spinal_stenosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Degenerative spondylolisthesis with secondary stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Severe mechanical back pain and radicular symptoms
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old female with known osteoporosis presented with L4/5 instability. Imaging revealed a Grade I degenerative spondylolisthesis where the forward slip of L4 on L5 resulted in significant "napkin-ring" stenosis of the central canal. She underwent a lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF) to restore alignment and indirectly decompress the neural elements.

spinal_stenosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Spinal stenosis secondary to Paget's disease
  presenting_complaint: Progressive lower limb weakness and bone pain
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with a history of Paget's disease of the bone presented with new-onset neurological deficits. CT imaging showed marked cortical thickening and expansion of the L3 vertebra, causing severe narrowing of the spinal canal. Treatment involved bisphosphonates to manage the underlying metabolic bone disease and subsequent surgical decompression for the neurological compromise.

spinal_stenosis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Lumbar stenosis with co-morbid peripheral vascular disease
  presenting_complaint: Leg pain on exertion (diagnostic challenge)
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male smoker presented with calf pain when walking. Clinical differentiation between vascular and neurogenic claudication was difficult; however, the presence of pedal pulses and the "shopping trolley sign" (relief when leaning forward) suggested a spinal origin. MRI confirmed L3-L5 stenosis, though his recovery was complicated by poor wound healing related to his underlying vascular insufficiency.

spinal_stenosis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe multi-level lumbar stenosis in a morbidly obese patient
  presenting_complaint: Inability to walk more than 10 yards due to leg pain
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male (BMI 48) presented with chronic, debilitating stenosis. Surgical intervention was initially deferred due to high perioperative risk, including obstructive sleep apnoea and poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes. Following significant weight loss through a medically supervised programme, he successfully underwent a minimally invasive decompression with reduced morbidity.

spinal_stenosis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Spinal stenosis due to ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL)
  presenting_complaint: Slowly progressive tetraparesis
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male of East Asian descent presented with worsening balance and hand weakness. CT imaging revealed extensive ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament from C2 to C5, severely compromising the spinal canal diameter. He underwent a complex multi-level laminectomy and instrumented fusion to prevent further neurological decline.

spinal_stenosis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic stenosis due to a synovial cyst
  presenting_complaint: Sudden exacerbation of unilateral sciatica
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old female with known mild lumbar stenosis presented with a 48-hour history of excruciating right-sided L4 pain. MRI identified a large synovial cyst arising from the facet joint, acutely narrowing the spinal canal and compressing the exiting nerve root. The cyst was successfully aspirated under CT guidance, providing immediate symptom relief and avoiding the need for open surgery.

spinal_stenosis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Thoracic spinal stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Progressive spastic paraparesis and sensory level at T10
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male presented with a stiff gait and numbness from the umbilicus downwards. While lumbar stenosis was initially suspected, MRI of the whole spine revealed severe calcification of the ligamentum flavum at the T9/10 level. This rare presentation of thoracic stenosis required a delicate posterior decompression, with the patient regaining significant mobility post-operatively.

spinal_stenosis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Lumbar stenosis in a patient with Parkinson's disease
  presenting_complaint: Worsening mobility and frequent falls
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male with Parkinson's disease reported that his walking had significantly deteriorated beyond what was expected from his tremors. Examination showed a stooped posture that partially relieved his leg pain, suggesting a dual pathology. MRI confirmed moderate L4/5 stenosis; however, surgical outcomes were guarded due to the postural instability inherent to his Parkinson's.

spinal_stenosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-traumatic spinal stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Delayed onset of neurological symptoms years after a spinal fracture
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male who sustained a T12 burst fracture in a motor vehicle accident 10 years prior presented with new-onset leg weakness. Imaging showed progressive kyphotic deformity and bony overgrowth into the canal at the site of the old injury. He required a complex anterior-posterior reconstruction to decompress the canal and restore sagittal balance.

spinal_stenosis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe lumbar stenosis in the very elderly (frailty)
  presenting_complaint: Near-total immobility due to bilateral leg pain
  summary_of_course: A 95-year-old female living in a nursing home presented with severe pain when standing. Given her multiple comorbidities, including congestive heart failure and cognitive impairment, she was not a candidate for general anaesthesia. She was managed palliatively with optimized analgesia, including low-dose gabapentin and a rolling walker, focusing on quality of life and bedside care.

spinal_stenosis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Spinal stenosis with failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent neuropathic pain despite multiple decompressions
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old female presented to the chronic pain clinic with "burning" leg pain following three previous surgeries for lumbar stenosis. Repeat imaging showed adequate decompression but extensive epidural fibrosis and chronic nerve root changes. She was eventually managed with a spinal cord stimulator (SCS) trial, which provided a 60% reduction in her pain scores.
