primary_cancer_myeloma_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Multiple Myeloma (IgG Kappa)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent lower back pain and lethargy.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male presented to his GP with a six-month history of worsening lumbar pain and fatigue. Blood tests revealed normocytic anaemia (Hb 92g/L) and an ESR of 110mm/hr; serum protein electrophoresis identified an IgG kappa paraprotein of 34g/L. Bone marrow aspirate confirmed 40% plasma cell infiltration, and he was commenced on a VRd (bortezomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone) induction regimen.

primary_cancer_myeloma_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Renal Failure secondary to Light Chain Myeloma
  presenting_complaint: Reduced urine output and nausea.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female was admitted via A&E with acute kidney injury (creatinine 450µmol/L) and dehydration. Investigations showed significant Bence-Jones proteinuria and a serum free light chain (SFLC) ratio of 500 (kappa). Renal biopsy confirmed light chain cast nephropathy, and she was urgently started on cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone alongside haemodialysis.

primary_cancer_myeloma_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Smouldering Multiple Myeloma
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of raised globulins on routine screening.
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old asymptomatic male was referred from primary care after routine health checks showed a total protein of 95g/L. Further testing identified an IgA lambda paraprotein of 22g/L but no evidence of CRAB features (calcium, renal, anaemia, bone lesions). He is currently managed with a "watch and wait" strategy with three-monthly monitoring of SFLCs and skeletal surveys.

primary_cancer_myeloma_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Multiple Myeloma with Spinal Cord Compression
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset lower limb weakness and urinary retention.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with a known history of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) presented acutely with bilateral leg paresis. Urgent MRI of the spine revealed a plasmacytoma at T10 causing significant cord compression. He underwent emergency decompressive laminectomy followed by radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy for newly diagnosed symptomatic myeloma.

primary_cancer_myeloma_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Hyperviscosity Syndrome in IgA Multiple Myeloma
  presenting_complaint: Blurred vision, epistaxis, and confusion.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male presented with subacute neurological decline and mucosal bleeding. Fundoscopy revealed "sausage-string" retinal veins, and serum viscosity was measured at 5.2 centipoise (normal 1.4-1.8). He underwent urgent plasmapheresis to reduce the IgA paraprotein load before commencing induction therapy with daratumumab-based combinations.

primary_cancer_myeloma_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Multiple Myeloma in a Young Adult
  presenting_complaint: Severe rib pain following a minor cough.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female presented with acute pleuritic chest pain; imaging confirmed multiple pathological rib fractures. Despite her young age, bone marrow biopsy showed 65% clonal plasma cells and a diagnosis of IgG Myeloma was made. She was treated aggressively with VTD (bortezomib, thalidomide, dexamethasone) followed by a tandem autologous stem cell transplant.

primary_cancer_myeloma_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Non-secretory Multiple Myeloma
  presenting_complaint: Unexplained bone pain and hypercalcaemia.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male presented with diffuse skeletal pain and a corrected calcium of 3.1mmol/L. Repeated serum and urine electrophoresis failed to identify a paraprotein band, but a PET-CT showed extensive lytic lesions throughout the axial skeleton. Bone marrow trephine finally confirmed 80% plasma cell infiltration, leading to a diagnosis of the rare non-secretory variant.

primary_cancer_myeloma_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Multiple Myeloma with Recurrent Infections
  presenting_complaint: Third episode of bacterial pneumonia within twelve months.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was investigated for recurrent respiratory sepsis. Immunoglobulin testing showed profound secondary hypogammaglobulinaemia (IgG <2g/L) and an underlying lambda paraprotein. Bone marrow biopsy confirmed myeloma, and she was started on prophylactic antibiotics and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) alongside her haematological treatment.

primary_cancer_myeloma_009:

  presenting_complaint: Macroglossia, ankle oedema, and proteinuria.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male presented with a large, painful tongue and signs of congestive heart failure. Echocardiography showed a "speckled" appearance of the myocardium, and a fat pad biopsy confirmed Congo Red positive amyloid deposits. He was diagnosed with concurrent IgG myeloma and AL amyloidosis, requiring cautious chemotherapy due to cardiac fragility.

primary_cancer_myeloma_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
  presenting_complaint: Increasing fatigue and rising paraprotein levels.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old female, previously in remission for three years following VMP (bortezomib, melphalan, prednisolone), showed a biochemical relapse with her IgG paraprotein rising from 2g/L to 28g/L. Despite second-line lenalidomide, her disease progressed with new lytic lesions on whole-body MRI. She has now been enrolled in a clinical trial for a B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) targeted CAR-T cell therapy.

primary_cancer_myeloma_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Plasma Cell Leukaemia (Primary)
  presenting_complaint: Severe bruising, breathlessness, and weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male presented with acute pancytopenia and hepatosplenomegaly. Peripheral blood film revealed a high circulating plasma cell count (>2 x 10^9/L), consistent with primary plasma cell leukaemia. This aggressive presentation required intensive multi-agent chemotherapy (PACE-like regimen) but the prognosis remains poor due to high-risk cytogenetics (t(14;16)).

primary_cancer_myeloma_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Multiple Myeloma with Extramedullary Disease
  presenting_complaint: Palpable soft tissue masses on the chest wall.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented with several firm, non-tender subcutaneous nodules over his ribs and sternum. Biopsy of a mass confirmed an extramedullary plasmacytoma, and subsequent staging revealed systemic myeloma with 50% marrow involvement. He was treated with a combination of systemic therapy and local radiotherapy to the symptomatic masses.

primary_cancer_myeloma_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Bence-Jones (Light Chain) Multiple Myeloma
  presenting_complaint: Generalized weakness and "foamy" urine.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old female was investigated for nephrotic-range proteinuria (6g/24h) and normocytic anaemia. Serum electrophoresis was unremarkable, but urine electrophoresis showed a dense monoclonal lambda light chain band. Bone marrow biopsy confirmed 45% plasma cells, and she was managed for light chain myeloma with renal-adjusted dosing of cyclophosphamide.

primary_cancer_myeloma_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Multiple Myeloma with Pathological Fracture
  presenting_complaint: Acute hip pain following a minor trip.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old female was admitted with a subtrochanteric femoral fracture occurring after minimal trauma. Intra-operative findings and subsequent histology of the bone fragments showed plasma cell infiltration. Post-operative workup confirmed symptomatic myeloma, and she was started on a modified attenuated Velcade-Dexamethasone (VD) protocol suited for her frailty.

primary_cancer_myeloma_015:
  primary_diagnosis: End-stage Multiple Myeloma
  presenting_complaint: Intractable bone pain and profound weakness.
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old male with multiple comorbidities and relapsed myeloma reached the end of viable treatment options after failing four lines of therapy. He presented with hypercalcaemia and worsening renal failure, and after multidisciplinary discussion, the focus of care shifted to palliation. He is currently receiving syringe driver analgesia and bisphosphonates for symptom control in a hospice setting.

primary_cancer_myeloma_016:
  primary_diagnosis: POEMS Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Numbness in feet, skin thickening, and gynaecomastia.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male presented with a progressive peripheral polyneuropathy and organomegaly. Investigations revealed a small lambda paraprotein, sclerotic bone lesions, and elevated VEGF levels, fulfilling the criteria for POEMS syndrome (Polyneuropathy, Organomegaly, Endocrinopathy, M-protein, Skin changes). He was treated with peripheral blood stem cell transplantation to target the underlying plasma cell dyscrasia.

primary_cancer_myeloma_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Solitary Plasmacytoma progressing to Myeloma
  presenting_complaint: New onset hip pain.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female had been treated three years prior for a solitary plasmacytoma of the ilium with radical radiotherapy. Recent follow-up showed a new IgG paraprotein of 12g/L and multiple "punched-out" lesions on a skeletal survey. This confirmed progression to symptomatic multiple myeloma, and she has commenced induction therapy with bortezomib and dexamethasone.

primary_cancer_myeloma_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Multiple Myeloma with Neutropenic Sepsis
  presenting_complaint: High fever and rigors during chemotherapy.
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male undergoing cycle 2 of KRD (carfilzomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone) for myeloma was admitted to the ICU with septic shock. His neutrophil count was 0.2 x 10^9/L, and blood cultures grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa. He required vasopressor support and broad-spectrum antibiotics before recovering sufficiently to resume a dose-reduced chemotherapy schedule.

primary_cancer_myeloma_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Multiple Myeloma (Incidental Diagnosis)
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue during cardiac investigation.
  summary_of_course: A 71-year-old female undergoing workup for stable angina was noted to have a persistent anaemia and a reversed albumin-globulin ratio. Further testing identified an IgA kappa M-protein and lytic skull lesions on X-ray. Despite the lack of severe symptoms, she met the IMWG criteria for myeloma and was initiated on a lenalidomide-dexamethasone maintenance programme.

primary_cancer_myeloma_020:
  primary_diagnosis: IgD Multiple Myeloma
  presenting_complaint: Severe weight loss and abdominal pain.
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male presented with advanced disease, including significant lymphadenopathy and renal impairment. Serum electrophoresis showed a very small M-spike, but immunofixation confirmed the rare IgD lambda subtype. This was associated with an aggressive clinical course and high-risk cytogenetics, necessitating intensive induction and early consideration for clinical trials.
