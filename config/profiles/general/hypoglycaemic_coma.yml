  presenting_complaint: Rigors, fever, and sudden loss of consciousness.
  summary_of_course: 74-year-old male with urosepsis and no history of diabetes found unresponsive. CBG was 2.2 mmol/L; hypoglycaemia was triggered by increased glucose utilisation and cytokine-mediated inhibition of gluconeogenesis. Recovered following IV antibiotics and glucose support.
