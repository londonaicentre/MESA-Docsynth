cauda_equina_syndrome_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES-R)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset lower back pain, bilateral sciatica, and urinary retention.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male presented to A&E after lifting heavy crates, reporting "electric shock" pains down both legs and inability to void for 8 hours. Examination revealed saddle anaesthesia and loss of anal tone; urgent MRI confirmed a massive central L4/L5 disc prolapse. He underwent emergency lumbar decompression within 6 hours of presentation, resulting in full motor recovery but persistent mild bladder hesitancy.

cauda_equina_syndrome_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute Cauda Equina Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Progressive leg weakness and new-onset faecal incontinence.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female with known spinal stenosis reported a two-week history of worsening gait instability and recent bowel accidents. Outpatient MRI demonstrated severe multi-level canal stenosis at L3-L5 with significant root crowding. She was admitted for elective-urgent laminectomy, which stabilised her symptoms, though she required ongoing community physiotherapy for residual foot drop.

cauda_equina_syndrome_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-operative Spinal Haematoma
  presenting_complaint: Severe back pain and leg numbness 4 hours post-discectomy.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male underwent an uncomplicated L5/S1 discectomy but developed escalating pain and progressive bilateral leg weakness in the recovery room. Emergency CT myelogram identified a large epidural haematoma causing acute cauda equina compression. He was rushed back to theatre for evacuation of the clot, achieving a near-complete neurological recovery over the following month.

cauda_equina_syndrome_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Tethered Cord Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Worsening tip-toe walking and nocturnal enuresis in a previously dry child.
  summary_of_course: A 9-year-old girl with a history of spina bifida occulta presented with a 3-month history of progressive calf wasting and new urinary incontinence. MRI spine revealed a low-lying conus medullaris at L4 and a thickened filum terminale causing traction. Surgical detethering was performed, which successfully halted the neurological decline and improved her gait.

cauda_equina_syndrome_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Traumatic Cauda Equina Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Paraplegia and loss of sensation following a high-velocity road traffic accident.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male was admitted to the ICU following a motorcycle crash with an L2 burst fracture and 50% canal encroachment. Clinical exam confirmed complete loss of motor and sensory function below the L2 level with absent bulbocavernosus reflex. Despite urgent posterior stabilisation and decompression, he remained with permanent neurogenic bladder and bowel dysfunction.

cauda_equina_syndrome_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Neoplastic Cauda Equina Compression
  presenting_complaint: Chronic night-time back pain and progressive saddle paraesthesia.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer presented with subacute sensory changes in his groin and difficulty initiating micturition. MRI showed vertebral body metastases at L3 with epidural extension compressing the cauda equina. He was treated with high-dose dexamethasone and urgent palliative radiotherapy, resulting in partial improvement of sensory symptoms.

cauda_equina_syndrome_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Neurosarcoidosis of the Cauda Equina
  presenting_complaint: Atypical leg weakness and patchy sensory loss.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female presented with a 2-month history of fluctuating lower limb weakness and "numb patches" on her thighs. MRI showed enhancement of the lumbar nerve roots, and a subsequent lumbar puncture revealed elevated ACE levels in the CSF. She was diagnosed with neurosarcoidosis and responded well to long-term corticosteroid therapy and methotrexate, avoiding surgical intervention.

cauda_equina_syndrome_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic Cauda Equina Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Sudden exacerbation of chronic back pain with new urinary overflow incontinence.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with long-standing lumbar spondylosis experienced a sudden "pop" while coughing, followed by immediate bilateral leg numbness. MRI confirmed an acute disc sequestration at L2/L3 superimposed on chronic multi-level stenosis. Due to multiple comorbidities including severe COPD, he underwent a targeted microdecompression under local anaesthetic, which partially restored bladder sensation.

cauda_equina_syndrome_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic Epidural Haematoma
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral leg heaviness and inability to void following epidural analgesia.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female in the obstetric ward developed progressive motor block 6 hours after the removal of a labour epidural catheter. Examination showed 0/5 power in ankle dorsiflexion and a palpable bladder. Urgent surgical evacuation of a spinal haematoma was performed; however, she was left with permanent saddle anaesthesia and requires intermittent self-catheterisation.

cauda_equina_syndrome_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Spinal Epidural Abscess
  presenting_complaint: Fever, excruciating back pain, and rapidly progressing leg weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use presented with a 3-day history of rigors and midline lumbar tenderness. Over 6 hours in the emergency department, he developed bilateral foot drop and urinary retention. MRI revealed a large posterior epidural abscess from L3-S1; he underwent emergency laminectomy and washout followed by 6 weeks of IV flucloxacillin.

cauda_equina_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Early Incomplete Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES-I)
  presenting_complaint: Unilateral sciatica and "altered feeling" when wiping after bowel movements.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female presented to her GP with right-sided S1 radiculopathy and subtle perianal numbness but normal bladder function. Recognising the red flags, the GP referred her for a same-day MRI, which showed a large paracentral L5/S1 disc protrusion. She underwent decompression within 18 hours of symptom onset, preventing progression to full urinary retention.

cauda_equina_syndrome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Cauda Equina Syndrome (Treatment Failure)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent neuropathic pain and neurogenic bladder 2 years post-surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male who had delayed decompression for CES (3 days post-symptom onset) presented to the outpatient clinic with refractory saddle pain. Despite initial surgery, he suffers from permanent sexual dysfunction and requires a permanent indwelling catheter. Management focuses on neuropathic pain modulation with pregabalin and referral to a specialist urology-neurology multidisciplinary team.

cauda_equina_syndrome_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Spinal Dural Arteriovenous Fistula (SDAVF)
  presenting_complaint: Gradually worsening leg stiffness and sphincter disturbance over 12 months.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male was initially misdiagnosed with peripheral neuropathy until he developed urinary urgency and progressive paraparesis. Spinal angiography confirmed an SDAVF at T12 causing venous congestion of the cauda equina. Following successful endovascular embolisation, his gait improved significantly, though mild bladder urgency persisted.

cauda_equina_syndrome_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Delayed Diagnosis of CES in Morbid Obesity
  presenting_complaint: Back pain and vague leg weakness in a patient with BMI 48.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female with morbid obesity had multiple A&E attendances for back pain, where physical examination was limited by her habitus. By the time an MRI was successfully performed at a bariatric-capable facility, she had been in complete urinary retention for 48 hours. Post-operative recovery was poor, complicated by wound dehiscence and permanent neurological deficits.

cauda_equina_syndrome_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Neglected Cauda Equina Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Found on floor with pressure sores and chronic urinary dribbling.
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old male with moderate dementia was admitted from home after being found in a state of self-neglect. Clinical examination revealed a distended bladder (1.2L on scan) and absent anal reflex, with MRI showing a long-standing L4/L5 disc extrusion. Given the duration of symptoms and high surgical risk, he was managed conservatively with long-term catheterisation and social care support.

cauda_equina_syndrome_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-traumatic L1 Wedge Fracture
  presenting_complaint: Saddle paraesthesia and mild weakness after a fall from a ladder.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male fell 3 metres, landing on his buttocks, and complained of "pins and needles" in his groin. CT showed an L1 wedge compression fracture with 30% retropulsion into the canal. He was managed with bed rest and a TLSO brace as his bladder function remained intact and symptoms resolved spontaneously over 72 hours.

cauda_equina_syndrome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Metastatic Spinal Cord Compression (MSCC) at the Conus
  presenting_complaint: Acute bilateral leg weakness and loss of bowel control.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old female with known breast cancer presented with sudden onset "heavy legs" and inability to stand. MRI identified a metastatic lesion at T12/L1 compressing the conus medullaris and upper cauda equina roots. She received emergency surgical decompression and stabilisation followed by adjuvant radiotherapy, regaining the ability to ambulate with a frame.

cauda_equina_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Tuberculous Spondylitis (Pott’s Disease)
  presenting_complaint: Night sweats, weight loss, and progressive lower limb paraparesis.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male recently arrived from a TB-endemic region presented with a 4-month history of worsening back pain and recent onset of saddle numbness. Imaging showed destruction of the L4 vertebral body with a large cold abscess compressing the cauda equina. He underwent surgical debridement and stabilisation, followed by a 12-month course of quadruple anti-tuberculous therapy.

cauda_equina_syndrome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Adolescent Growth-Related Tethered Cord
  presenting_complaint: New onset scoliosis and urinary frequency during a growth spurt.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old male with a history of occult spinal dysraphism presented with a rapidly progressing spinal curve and new daytime wetting. MRI confirmed the spinal cord was tethered by a fatty filum terminale, which had become symptomatic during his pubertal growth spurt. Surgical release of the filum led to stabilisation of his scoliosis and resolution of urinary symptoms.

cauda_equina_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Cauda Equina Syndrome secondary to Spinal Anaesthesia
  presenting_complaint: Persistent numbness and leg weakness 24 hours after an elective inguinal hernia repair.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female reported that the "numbness" from her spinal anaesthetic never wore off on the left side. MRI was unremarkable for haematoma or disc, suggesting direct neurotoxicity or needle trauma to the nerve roots. She was managed conservatively with intensive rehabilitation and neuropathic pain medications, showing slow improvement over 6 months.
