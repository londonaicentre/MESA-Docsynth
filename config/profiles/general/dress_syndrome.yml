She was treated with oral prednisolone (1mg/kg) in an outpatient setting with successful resolution of symptoms over one month.

dress_syndrome_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute DRESS syndrome with acute kidney injury
  presenting_complaint: Malaise, skin peeling, and reduced urine output.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male on carbamazepine for trigeminal neuralgia presented with exfoliative dermatitis and AKI (creatinine 240 µmol/L). Clinical assessment showed significant facial swelling and cervical lymphadenopathy. Following drug cessation and high-dose steroids, renal function returned to baseline, though skin desquamation persisted for three weeks.

dress_syndrome_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening DRESS syndrome with fulminant hepatitis
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice, confusion, and generalised skin redness.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female presented 5 weeks after starting phenytoin with rapidly progressing jaundice and an erythroderma rash. She was admitted to the ICU with hepatic encephalopathy and ALT > 2000 U/L. Despite aggressive treatment with IVIG and ciclosporin, she required assessment for urgent liver transplantation due to liver failure.

dress_syndrome_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute DRESS syndrome secondary to vancomycin
  presenting_complaint: Low-grade fever and itchy rash on trunk and limbs.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old patient treated for MRSA osteomyelitis developed a confluent maculopapular eruption 21 days into vancomycin therapy. Laboratory tests confirmed mild eosinophilia (0.9 x 10^9/L) and borderline transaminitis. The antibiotic was switched to linezolid, and the rash resolved with topical clobetasol propionate and a short course of oral antihistamines.

dress_syndrome_006:
  primary_diagnosis: DRESS syndrome with myocarditis complication
  presenting_complaint: Chest pain, dyspnoea, and widespread rash.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male on lamotrigine for epilepsy presented with typical DRESS features including fever and rash, but also reported acute pleuritic chest pain. ECG showed ST-segment changes and Troponin T was significantly elevated at 450 ng/L. Cardiac MRI confirmed eosinophilic myocarditis; he was treated with pulsed methylprednisolone and stabilised in the cardiac high dependency unit.

dress_syndrome_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic-relapsing DRESS syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent flares of rash and pyrexia during steroid tapering.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old woman with DRESS induced by dapsone experienced three distinct clinical relapses over 6 months whenever her prednisolone dose was reduced below 15mg. Each flare involved a return of the morbilliform rash and eosinophilia. Long-term immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil was eventually required to achieve sustained remission.

dress_syndrome_008:
  primary_diagnosis: DRESS syndrome with pulmonary involvement (pneumonitis)
  presenting_complaint: Non-productive cough, hypoxia, and skin eruption.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male starting minocycline for acne developed a rash and progressive shortness of breath over 5 weeks. High-resolution CT chest showed bilateral ground-glass opacities, and BAL confirmed eosinophilic pneumonitis. He required oxygen therapy and high-dose systemic corticosteroids, leading to a slow but complete respiratory recovery.

dress_syndrome_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate DRESS syndrome following trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
  presenting_complaint: Fever, facial swelling, and "measles-like" rash.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old HIV-positive patient treated for PCP prophylaxis presented with a RegiSCAR-probable DRESS syndrome. Findings included prominent post-auricular lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia (3.2 x 10^9/L), and mild hepatitis. Symptoms resolved over three weeks following cessation of the sulfonamide and initiation of oral steroids.

dress_syndrome_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Atypical DRESS syndrome (minimal rash)
  presenting_complaint: Unexplained fever, hepatitis, and haematological abnormalities.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female on phenobarbital presented with persistent pyrexia and significant malaise but only a very faint, transient truncal erythema. Extensive workup revealed atypical lymphocytosis (15%) and severe transaminitis (ALT 1200 U/L). A skin biopsy was non-specific, but the temporal relationship and systemic involvement confirmed DRESS, responding well to prednisolone.

dress_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: DRESS syndrome with late-onset autoimmune thyroiditis
  presenting_complaint: Initial rash and fever, followed by neck swelling months later.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male recovered from carbamazepine-induced DRESS in the hospital. Two months post-discharge, he developed symptoms of hypothyroidism and a goitre. Investigations confirmed Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, a recognised late autoimmune complication of DRESS, requiring lifelong levothyroxine replacement.

dress_syndrome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: DRESS syndrome in an elderly patient with polypharmacy
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, skin rash, and deranged bloods.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female on multiple medications was admitted with a suspected drug reaction. Identifying the culprit was difficult, but allopurinol started 7 weeks prior was the likely trigger. Despite drug cessation, she developed secondary staphylococcal sepsis through denuded skin areas, requiring ICU admission and prolonged antibiotic therapy.

dress_syndrome_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic DRESS syndrome with pre-existing CKD
  presenting_complaint: Worsening renal function and new-onset rash.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old with Stage 3 CKD was started on allopurinol for hyperuricaemia. She presented 4 weeks later with a DRESS-pattern rash and Stage 3 AKI (creatinine 480 µmol/L). Due to her renal vulnerability, she required temporary haemodialysis alongside steroid treatment to manage the systemic inflammatory response.

dress_syndrome_014:
  primary_diagnosis: DRESS syndrome with HHV-6 reactivation
  presenting_complaint: Severe, non-resolving rash and persistent high fevers.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male with mexiletine-induced DRESS failed to improve after 10 days of prednisolone. PCR testing confirmed high-level HHV-6 viraemia, correlating with his prolonged clinical course and severe multi-organ involvement. Ganciclovir was added to his regimen, leading to a gradual reduction in viral load and clinical improvement.

dress_syndrome_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild DRESS syndrome (Outpatient management)
  presenting_complaint: Itchy rash and low-grade pyrexia.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old female on lamotrigine for bipolar disorder developed a patchy maculopapular rash and mild facial oedema. FBC showed an eosinophil count of 0.8 x 10^9/L with normal LFTs. Given the mild presentation, she was managed in the dermatology clinic with immediate drug cessation and a tapering course of oral prednisolone over 4 weeks.

dress_syndrome_016:
  primary_diagnosis: DRESS syndrome mimicking lymphoma
  presenting_complaint: Massive lymphadenopathy, fever, and weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented with significant cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy 6 weeks after starting abacavir. Initial suspicion of lymphoma led to a core needle biopsy, which showed reactive hyperplasia. Subsequent eosinophilia (4.0 x 10^9/L) and rash development confirmed DRESS syndrome, which resolved upon drug withdrawal and steroid therapy.

dress_syndrome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: DRESS syndrome with gastrointestinal involvement
  presenting_complaint: Profuse watery diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and rash.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female on strontium ranelate developed a widespread skin eruption accompanied by severe colitis. Endoscopy showed an eosinophilic infiltration of the colonic mucosa. The systemic nature of the reaction, including eosinophilia and fever, confirmed DRESS, requiring prolonged IV fluids and systemic steroids.

dress_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory DRESS syndrome requiring Ciclosporin
  presenting_complaint: Progressive erythroderma despite high-dose prednisolone.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male with DRESS secondary to phenytoin showed no response to 1mg/kg of oral prednisolone after 7 days, with ALT continuing to rise. He was transitioned to ciclosporin (3mg/kg), which resulted in rapid skin improvement and normalisation of LFTs within two weeks.

dress_syndrome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: DRESS syndrome in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Generalised rash and fever at 32 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old pregnant woman developed DRESS 5 weeks after starting nitrofurantoin for a UTI. Management was complicated by the need to balance steroid side effects with foetal health. She was monitored closely by a multidisciplinary team; the baby was delivered healthy at term, though the mother required steroids for 8 weeks postpartum.

dress_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: DRESS syndrome with neurological involvement (Encephalitis)
  presenting_complaint: Seizures, altered mental status, and rash.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male on carbamazepine presented with a morbilliform rash and sudden onset focal seizures. CSF analysis showed a mild pleocytosis and negative virology, while MRI indicated signal changes in the temporal lobes. His neurological symptoms improved significantly following the initiation of pulsed steroids for DRESS-associated limbic encephalitis.
