hyponatraemia_001:
  primary_diagnosis: SIADH secondary to Small Cell Lung Cancer
  presenting_complaint: Progressive confusion, lethargy, and a chronic cough.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male smoker presented with a two-week history of worsening confusion and a serum sodium of 118 mmol/L. Investigations revealed euvolaemic hyponatraemia with high urine osmolality (540 mOsm/kg) and urine sodium (65 mmol/L), while a CT chest confirmed a hilar mass. He was diagnosed with SIADH secondary to small cell lung cancer and managed with fluid restriction and oncology referral.

hyponatraemia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Exercise-Associated Hyponatraemia (EAH)
  presenting_complaint: Collapse and seizure following completion of a marathon.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female runner collapsed at the finish line after consuming excessive hypotonic fluids during a race. Initial bloods showed an acute, life-threatening sodium of 121 mmol/L with signs of cerebral oedema. She was treated with urgent intravenous boluses of 3% hypertonic saline in the emergency department, resulting in rapid clinical improvement and stabilisation of sodium levels.

hyponatraemia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Thiazide-Induced Hyponatraemia
  presenting_complaint: Dizziness, falls, and generalised weakness.
  summary_of_course: An 81-year-old female was admitted following a fall; she had recently started Indapamide for hypertension. Laboratory tests showed a moderate hyponatraemia of 124 mmol/L and mild hypokalaemia. The diuretic was discontinued, and she was treated with cautious intravenous 0.9% sodium chloride, with her sodium returning to baseline over four days.

hyponatraemia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Psychogenic Polydipsia
  presenting_complaint: Polyuria and acute agitation.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia was brought to A&E after drinking approximately 12 litres of water in six hours. His sodium was 115 mmol/L on admission, putting him at high risk for seizures. He was managed in the ICU with strict fluid restriction and frequent electrolyte monitoring to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome.

hyponatraemia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypervolaemic Hyponatraemia secondary to Congestive Heart Failure
  presenting_complaint: Increasing shortness of breath and peripheral oedema.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with NYHA Class IV heart failure presented with worsening dyspnoea and a serum sodium of 129 mmol/L. Clinical examination showed raised JVP and bilateral pitting oedema, indicating a hypervolaemic state. Treatment focused on aggressive diuresis with Furosemide and fluid restriction, which improved both his fluid overload and sodium levels.

hyponatraemia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Depletional Hyponatraemia due to Addison's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal pain, vomiting, and profound hypotension.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female presented in an Addisonian crisis with a sodium of 122 mmol/L and potassium of 5.9 mmol/L. She was tanned despite lack of sun exposure and had a history of autoimmune thyroiditis. She responded rapidly to intravenous hydrocortisone and aggressive fluid resuscitation with 0.9% saline.

hyponatraemia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Beer Potomania
  presenting_complaint: Gait instability and tremors.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with chronic alcohol dependence and poor nutritional intake presented with a serum sodium of 110 mmol/L. His diet consisted almost exclusively of lager, leading to low solute intake and impaired water excretion. Because of the high risk of osmotic demyelination, his sodium was corrected very slowly using a combination of 5% dextrose and controlled solute replacement.

hyponatraemia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: MDMA-Induced Hyponatraemia
  presenting_complaint: Altered mental state and vomiting after a music festival.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female was admitted with acute confusion and a sodium of 114 mmol/L after ingesting MDMA and drinking large quantities of water. The combination of drug-induced SIADH and excessive water intake led to severe acute hyponatraemia. She required ICU admission for management of raised intracranial pressure and cautious electrolyte correction.

hyponatraemia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-operative Hyponatraemia
  presenting_complaint: Post-operative seizures and headache.
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old boy underwent an uncomplicated appendicectomy but was maintained on 0.45% sodium chloride post-operatively. He developed a sudden seizure 24 hours later with a sodium of 119 mmol/L. The hypotonic fluids were ceased, and he was treated with a 3% saline bolus to stop seizure activity and increase sodium to a safe range.

hyponatraemia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Cerebral Salt Wasting (CSW)
  presenting_complaint: Polyuria and hypotension following neurosurgery.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male developed a sodium of 126 mmol/L three days after surgery for a subarachnoid haemorrhage. Unlike SIADH, he was clinically hypovolaemic with high urine output and very high urine sodium (>100 mmol/L). He was successfully treated with volume replacement using 0.9% saline and oral salt tablets, rather than fluid restriction.

hyponatraemia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypovolaemic Hyponatraemia due to Gastrointestinal Loss
  presenting_complaint: Severe diarrhoea and vomiting for five days.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male presented with a five-day history of viral gastroenteritis, feeling faint and thirsty. Bloods showed a sodium of 128 mmol/L and a urea of 12.0 mmol/L, consistent with dehydration. He was treated with intravenous 0.9% sodium chloride in the clinical decisions unit, which corrected his volume status and electrolytes.

hyponatraemia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: SSRI-Induced SIADH
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic low sodium found on routine screening.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female was found to have a serum sodium of 127 mmol/L during a routine check-up four weeks after starting Sertraline for depression. She was euvolaemic and otherwise well. The Sertraline was discontinued and replaced with Mirtazapine, leading to a full resolution of the hyponatraemia within two weeks.

hyponatraemia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Pseudohyponatraemia secondary to Hypertriglyceridaemia
  presenting_complaint: Epigastric pain and eruptive xanthomata.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male with acute pancreatitis was found to have a serum sodium of 121 mmol/L. However, his measured serum osmolality was normal (285 mOsm/kg), and his serum appeared lipaemic. This was identified as pseudohyponatraemia caused by severe hypertriglyceridaemia (triglycerides 45 mmol/L), requiring no specific treatment for sodium.

hyponatraemia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Reset Osmostat
  presenting_complaint: Chronic, stable mild hyponatraemia.
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old resident of a nursing home had a documented serum sodium between 129 and 132 mmol/L for over two years. Despite various trials of fluid restriction, the level remained unchanged, and she remained asymptomatic. A water load test confirmed a reset osmostat, a benign condition in the elderly, and further interventions were ceased.

hyponatraemia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: TURP Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Visual disturbances, bradycardia, and confusion during surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male underwent a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) using large volumes of glycine irrigation. Intra-operatively, he became acutely confused and hypertensive with a sodium of 112 mmol/L due to systemic absorption of the irrigation fluid. He was treated with loop diuretics and hypertonic saline in the recovery room.

hyponatraemia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypothyroidism-Induced Hyponatraemia
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance.
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old female presented with a sodium of 125 mmol/L and clinical signs of myxoedema. Thyroid function tests revealed a TSH of 85 mIU/L and a free T4 of 4 pmol/L. Her hyponatraemia, caused by reduced free water clearance, was corrected solely through gradual thyroid hormone replacement with Levothyroxine.

hyponatraemia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Nephrotic Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Facial swelling and frothy urine.
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old girl presented with periorbital oedema and significant proteinuria. Her serum sodium was 131 mmol/L with low albumin (18 g/L). The hyponatraemia was hypervolaemic in nature due to secondary hyperaldosteronism and was managed with corticosteroids for the underlying minimal change disease and cautious fluid management.

hyponatraemia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Tea and Toast Diet (Low Solute Intake)
  presenting_complaint: Generalised malaise and poor appetite.
  summary_of_course: An isolated 85-year-old male living on a diet of only tea and white bread presented with a sodium of 123 mmol/L. His urine osmolality was very low (110 mOsm/kg), indicating that his kidneys were functioning correctly but lacked sufficient solute to excrete water. He was treated with a high-protein diet and oral salt supplements, which normalised his sodium.

hyponatraemia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Desmopressin-Induced Hyponatraemia
  presenting_complaint: Morning headache and nausea.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy taking Desmopressin for nocturnal enuresis developed a sodium of 126 mmol/L after drinking several glasses of water before bed. The medication prevented the normal excretion of the water load. The parents were counselled on strict fluid restriction after taking the dose, and the hyponatraemia resolved.

hyponatraemia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Osmotic Demyelination Syndrome (ODS) Risk Management
  presenting_complaint: Profound weakness following rapid sodium correction.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old malnourished female was admitted with a sodium of 105 mmol/L. During treatment, her sodium rose to 125 mmol/L within 18 hours, exceeding the safe limit for chronic hyponatraemia. To prevent ODS, clinicians administered intravenous 5% dextrose and Desmopressin to "re-lower" the sodium to 115 mmol/L, followed by more controlled correction.
