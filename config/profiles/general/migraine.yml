  primary_diagnosis: Basilar-type migraine (Migraine with brainstem aura)
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral visual loss, dysarthria, and ataxia.

  primary_diagnosis: Refractory migraine in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Severe, intractable migraine at 14 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old pregnant female presented to the maternity assessment unit with status migrainosus.

  presenting_complaint: Sudden, severe headache triggered by weightlifting.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male experienced a "thunderclap" headache during a gym session.
