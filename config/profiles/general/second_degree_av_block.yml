second_degree_av_block_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Mobitz Type I (Wenckebach) Second Degree AV Block
  presenting_complaint: Routine health screening; asymptomatic
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male elite rower underwent a screening ECG which revealed progressive PR interval lengthening followed by a non-conducted P wave. He was entirely asymptomatic with no family history of sudden cardiac death. Given his high athletic conditioning and absence of symptoms, this was deemed physiological nocturnal vagal tone; no intervention was required, and he was cleared for competitive sports.

second_degree_av_block_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Mobitz Type II Second Degree AV Block
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of lightheadedness and near-syncope
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female presented with a three-week history of transient dizziness. ECG demonstrated a constant PR interval with intermittent dropped QRS complexes in a 3:2 and 4:3 ratio. She was admitted for urgent cardiology review due to the high risk of progression to complete heart block. A dual-chamber permanent pacemaker was successfully implanted, and her symptoms resolved completely.

second_degree_av_block_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Mobitz Type I AV Block secondary to Inferior MI
  presenting_complaint: Central crushing chest pain and diaphoresis
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department with an acute inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). During primary PCI to the right coronary artery, he developed Mobitz I second-degree AV block. The rhythm was haemodynamically stable and resolved spontaneously within 24 hours of successful reperfusion without the need for temporary pacing.

second_degree_av_block_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Drug-induced Mobitz Type I Second Degree AV Block
  presenting_complaint: Lethargy and bradycardia following medication change
  summary_of_course: A 71-year-old female with atrial fibrillation and hypertension was recently started on Verapamil in addition to her existing Bisoprolol. She presented with a heart rate of 38 bpm and fatigue. ECG confirmed Wenckebach phenomenon. Verapamil was withheld, and her beta-blocker dose was reduced, leading to the restoration of 1:1 AV conduction within 48 hours.

second_degree_av_block_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Mobitz Type II AV Block post-TAVI
  presenting_complaint: Post-operative monitoring following valve replacement
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old male underwent a Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) for severe aortic stenosis. On post-operative day two, telemetry recorded sudden dropped beats without PR prolongation, consistent with Mobitz II block. Due to the proximity of the valve prosthesis to the conduction system, this was treated as a definitive indication for a permanent pacemaker prior to discharge.

second_degree_av_block_006:
  primary_diagnosis: High-grade Second Degree AV Block (3:1 conduction)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden collapse and brief loss of consciousness
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male was brought in by ambulance after a syncopal episode while walking. ECG showed a 3:1 AV conduction pattern with a wide QRS complex, suggesting infra-nodal block. He remained bradycardic at 32 bpm and required an emergency temporary transvenous wire in the ICU. He subsequently received a permanent pacemaker for high-grade AV block.

second_degree_av_block_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Mobitz Type I AV Block in Acute Myocarditis
  presenting_complaint: Fever, myalgia, and pleuritic chest pain
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male presented with a viral prodrome followed by chest pain and breathlessness. Troponin T was significantly elevated at 450 ng/L, and ECG showed Mobitz I AV block. Cardiac MRI confirmed acute myocarditis. He was managed conservatively with anti-inflammatories and close monitoring; the conduction delay resolved as the myocardial inflammation subsided.

second_degree_av_block_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Mobitz Type II AV Block in Lyme Carditis
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations and Erythema Migrans rash
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female presented with a "bullseye" rash and intermittent palpitations after a hiking trip in Scotland. ECG revealed Mobitz II second-degree AV block. Lyme serology returned positive for Borrelia burgdorferi. She was treated with a 21-day course of IV Ceftriaxone, which resulted in the complete reversal of the AV block and normalization of the ECG.

second_degree_av_block_009:
  primary_diagnosis: 2:1 Second Degree AV Block secondary to Hyperkalaemia
  presenting_complaint: Profound weakness and oliguria
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old patient with Stage 5 CKD presented with a potassium level of 7.4 mmol/L. The ECG showed 2:1 AV block with peaked T-waves and widened QRS complexes. Immediate treatment with calcium gluconate, insulin-dextrose, and urgent haemodialysis was initiated. Following the reduction of serum potassium to 4.8 mmol/L, 1:1 AV conduction was restored.

second_degree_av_block_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Mobitz Type I AV Block secondary to Digoxin Toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Nausea, vomiting, and "yellowish" vision
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old female on Digoxin for heart failure presented with gastrointestinal distress and xanthopsia. ECG showed Wenckebach periods and frequent PVCs. Her Digoxin level was toxic at 3.2 ng/mL. She was treated with Digoxin-specific antibody fragments (Digibind), leading to the resolution of the AV block and symptomatic improvement.

second_degree_av_block_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Paroxysmal Mobitz Type II AV Block
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent "thumping" in chest and dizzy spells
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male had multiple normal resting ECGs despite frequent symptoms. A 7-day Holter monitor was fitted, which captured several episodes of paroxysmal Mobitz II block during normal daily activities, coinciding with his symptoms. He was referred for electrophysiology (EP) studies, which confirmed significant His-Purkinje disease, and a pacemaker was subsequently implanted.

second_degree_av_block_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Mobitz Type II AV Block with Anterior MI
  presenting_complaint: Severe retrosternal chest pain and dyspnoea
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male presented with an acute anterior STEMI. While in the catheterisation lab, he developed Mobitz II AV block with a new right bundle branch block (RBBB). This indicated extensive septal ischaemia. Despite successful stenting of the LAD, the block persisted, necessitating a permanent pacemaker due to the high risk of progression to asystole in the context of anterior infarction.

second_degree_av_block_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Mobitz Type I AV Block during Obstructive Sleep Apnoea
  presenting_complaint: Excessive daytime somnolence and loud snoring
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old obese male underwent overnight oximetry and ECG monitoring for suspected sleep apnoea. The recording showed frequent episodes of Mobitz I AV block during periods of prolonged apnoea and oxygen desaturation. These conduction abnormalities were absent during wakefulness. Treatment with CPAP therapy significantly reduced the apnoeic events and abolished the nocturnal AV block.

second_degree_av_block_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Mobitz Type II AV Block in Lev's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Progressive exercise intolerance and fatigue
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old male with a history of idiopathic fibrosis of the conduction system (Lev's disease) presented with worsening dyspnoea on exertion. Serial ECGs showed a stable Mobitz II block that had been monitored for months. Due to increasing symptoms and a falling mean heart rate on 24-hour monitoring, he was upgraded from medical observation to a permanent pacemaker.

second_degree_av_block_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Mobitz Type I AV Block in paediatric patient
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding during pre-operative assessment for tonsillectomy
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old boy was found to have a slow, irregular pulse during a pre-op check. ECG confirmed Mobitz Type I second-degree AV block. An echocardiogram showed a structurally normal heart, and a 24-hour tape showed the block occurred primarily at rest and during sleep. As he was asymptomatic and reached an appropriate heart rate during exercise testing, he was managed with periodic clinical review.

second_degree_av_block_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Mobitz Type II AV Block secondary to Cardiac Sarcoidosis
  presenting_complaint: Syncope and chronic non-productive cough
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old female with known pulmonary sarcoidosis presented with a sudden blackout. ECG showed Mobitz II AV block. Cardiac MRI revealed late gadolinium enhancement in the basal septum consistent with sarcoid involvement. She received a dual-chamber ICD (Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator) rather than a standard pacemaker due to the risk of ventricular arrhythmias associated with her underlying condition.

second_degree_av_block_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Mobitz Type II AV Block post-Mitral Valve Replacement
  presenting_complaint: Bradycardia on ICU monitor post-cardiac surgery
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male underwent surgical mitral valve replacement. On day one post-op, he developed a 2:1 AV block which then transitioned into Mobitz II. Temporary epicardial pacing wires were used to maintain cardiac output. When the block failed to resolve after five days of observation, a permanent pacemaker was implanted prior to transfer to the ward.

second_degree_av_block_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Mobitz Type I AV Block in Acute Rheumatic Fever
  presenting_complaint: Migratory polyarthritis and new heart murmur
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old girl presented with painful, swollen joints and a fever. Clinical examination revealed a pansystolic murmur and a friction rub. ECG showed a prolonged PR interval and occasional Wenckebach periods. Following the Jones criteria, she was diagnosed with acute rheumatic fever. The AV block was treated as a manifestation of carditis and resolved with a course of penicillin and salicylates.

second_degree_av_block_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Mobitz Type I AV Block (Vagal-induced)
  presenting_complaint: Fainting during venepuncture
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male experienced a vasovagal syncopal episode during a blood test. Continuous ECG monitoring during the event captured a period of sinus bradycardia followed by Mobitz I AV block and a brief 4-second ventricular standstill. Given the clear situational trigger and lack of underlying heart disease, he was advised on lifestyle measures and physical counter-pressure manoeuvres.

second_degree_av_block_020:
  primary_diagnosis: High-grade Second Degree AV Block in Beta-blocker Overdose
  presenting_complaint: Intentional overdose; bradycardia and hypotension
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male was brought to A&E after ingesting 2g of Atenolol. He was hypotensive (BP 80/40 mmHg) with a heart rate of 30 bpm. ECG showed high-grade second-degree AV block with 4:1 conduction. He was treated with IV atropine, glucagon, and a high-dose insulin-euglycaemia protocol. Conduction returned to 1:1 as the drug levels declined over the subsequent 24 hours.
