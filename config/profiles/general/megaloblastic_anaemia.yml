megaloblastic_anaemia_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Pernicious anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Lethargy, dyspnoea on exertion, and a sore tongue.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female presented with a 6-month history of progressive fatigue and glossitis. Investigations revealed Hb 82 g/L, MCV 118 fL, and low serum B12 (90 ng/L) with positive anti-intrinsic factor antibodies. She commenced intramuscular hydroxocobalamin loading doses, resulting in a significant reticulocyte response and resolution of symptoms.

megaloblastic_anaemia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Dietary Vitamin B12 deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Generalised weakness and mild cognitive impairment.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male, a strict vegan for five years without supplementation, presented to his GP with poor concentration and weakness. Blood tests showed a macrocytic anaemia (Hb 105 g/L, MCV 112 fL) and B12 levels of 110 ng/L. He was treated with oral cyanocobalamin and dietary counselling, with full haematological recovery within three months.

megaloblastic_anaemia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Folate deficiency anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Severe fatigue and palpitations.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with chronic alcohol excess and poor nutritional intake presented with symptomatic anaemia. Investigations showed Hb 75 g/L, MCV 122 fL, and serum folate of 1.2 μg/L, while B12 was normal. He was treated with 5mg daily oral folic acid and thiamine, showing rapid improvement in Hb levels.

megaloblastic_anaemia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral paraesthesia in hands and feet and unsteady gait.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female presented with progressive neurological deficits and sensory ataxia. Despite a borderline Hb of 115 g/L, her MCV was 106 fL and B12 was critically low at 45 ng/L. MRI spine showed dorsal column signal changes, and intensive B12 replacement was initiated to prevent permanent disability.

megaloblastic_anaemia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Nitrous oxide-induced megaloblastic anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of tingling in extremities and difficulty walking.
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old male admitted to the emergency department after heavy recreational use of nitrous oxide canisters. Laboratory findings showed a megaloblastic picture with Hb 110 g/L and MCV 108 fL, caused by N2O-induced inactivation of cobalamin. He was treated with high-dose B12 injections and advised on cessation of substance use.

megaloblastic_anaemia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Crohn’s disease-related B12 deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Chronic diarrhoea and worsening exhaustion.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male with a history of terminal ileal resection for Crohn’s disease presented with recurrent anaemia. Hb was 88 g/L with an MCV of 115 fL, confirming malabsorptive megaloblastic anaemia. He requires lifelong 3-monthly hydroxocobalamin injections due to the loss of the primary site for B12-intrinsic factor complex absorption.

megaloblastic_anaemia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Metformin-induced B12 deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Gradual onset of tiredness and peripheral neuropathy.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female on long-term high-dose metformin for Type 2 Diabetes presented with new-onset macrocytosis (MCV 104 fL) and Hb 108 g/L. Serum B12 was found to be 130 ng/L, attributed to metformin-mediated interference with B12 absorption in the ileum. Symptoms improved following B12 supplementation while continuing her diabetic medication.

megaloblastic_anaemia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Folate deficiency in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Routine antenatal screening showing low haemoglobin.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old pregnant female (26 weeks gestation) with twin pregnancy presented with Hb 92 g/L and MCV 105 fL. Despite standard prenatal vitamins, her folate levels were low (2.1 μg/L) due to increased foetal demand. She was started on 5mg folic acid daily, which stabilised her haematological parameters for the remainder of the pregnancy.

megaloblastic_anaemia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe megaloblastic pancytopenia
  presenting_complaint: Epistaxis, bruising, and profound lethargy.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male presented with a life-threatening pancytopenia (Hb 58 g/L, WBC 2.1 x 10^9/L, Plt 45 x 10^9/L) initially concerning for acute leukaemia. Bone marrow aspirate showed classic megaloblastic maturation and hypersegmented neutrophils. Extremely low B12 (<30 ng/L) was identified, and the patient responded dramatically to parenteral B12, avoiding the need for chemotherapy.

megaloblastic_anaemia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Methotrexate-induced megaloblastic anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Oral ulcers and fatigue.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female with rheumatoid arthritis on weekly methotrexate presented with acute-on-chronic anaemia. Bloods showed Hb 98 g/L and MCV 110 fL with low red cell folate. The presentation was attributed to folate antagonism by methotrexate; she was treated with folinic acid rescue and a review of her folic acid supplementation regimen.

megaloblastic_anaemia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Coeliac disease with mixed deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss, bloating, and fatigue.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male presented with a dimorphic blood film and an MCV of 98 fL (near-normal due to combined iron and folate deficiency). Subsequent investigations confirmed Coeliac disease (anti-TTG positive) and low folate (1.8 μg/L). A gluten-free diet and oral folate supplementation corrected the megaloblastic changes.

megaloblastic_anaemia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Imerslund-Gräsbeck Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Failure to thrive and pallor in a child.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy presented with chronic anaemia (Hb 85 g/L, MCV 102 fL) and mild proteinuria. Genetic testing confirmed a mutation in the AMN gene, leading to selective vitamin B12 malabsorption. He was successfully managed with regular parenteral B12 injections, resulting in normal growth and development.

megaloblastic_anaemia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Megaloblastic anaemia with pseudo-thrombotic microangiopathy
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice, dyspnoea, and dark urine.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male presented with Hb 65 g/L, high LDH (3500 U/L), and schistocytes on the blood film, mimicking TTP. However, the reticulocyte count was low and B12 was undetectable, pointing to ineffective erythropoiesis rather than primary haemolysis. B12 replacement led to a rapid fall in LDH and recovery of cell counts, confirming pseudo-TMA.

megaloblastic_anaemia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Megaloblastic madness (Psychiatric B12 deficiency)
  presenting_complaint: New-onset paranoia, visual hallucinations, and confusion.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male was admitted to the psychogeriatric ward with acute psychosis. Physical examination noted a smooth tongue and loss of vibration sense. Bloods revealed Hb 90 g/L, MCV 125 fL, and B12 65 ng/L. His psychiatric symptoms resolved completely within weeks of commencing B12 injections.

megaloblastic_anaemia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-gastrectomy B12 deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Severe shortness of breath on minimal exertion.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male who underwent a total gastrectomy for gastric cancer five years prior presented with Hb 72 g/L and MCV 118 fL. He had defaulted from his follow-up and stopped his routine B12 injections. Following a blood transfusion and re-initiation of IM hydroxocobalamin, his Hb normalised.

megaloblastic_anaemia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Tropical Sprue-related megaloblastic anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Chronic steatorrhoea and profound weight loss following travel.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female returned from a year in Southeast Asia with persistent malabsorption. Laboratory tests showed a megaloblastic anaemia (Hb 88 g/L, MCV 114 fL) with both low B12 and folate. She was treated with tetracycline and high-dose vitamins, leading to resolution of the sprue and the anaemia.

megaloblastic_anaemia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Phenytoin-induced folate deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Routine monitoring showing macrocytosis.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old female on long-term phenytoin for epilepsy was found to have an MCV of 109 fL with a mild anaemia (Hb 112 g/L). Serum folate was low at 2.4 μg/L, a known side effect of phenytoin interfering with folate metabolism. She was started on 5mg folic acid daily, which corrected the macrocytosis without affecting seizure control.

megaloblastic_anaemia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Fish tapeworm (Diphyllobothrium latum) infection
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal discomfort and fatigue.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male who frequently consumed raw freshwater fish presented with macrocytic anaemia (Hb 95 g/L, MCV 116 fL). Stool microscopy revealed Diphyllobothrium latum eggs, and B12 levels were low as the parasite competes for host B12. Treatment with praziquantel and a short course of B12 corrected the deficiency.

megaloblastic_anaemia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic megaloblastic anaemia triggered by sepsis
  presenting_complaint: Collapse, fever, and severe pallor.
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old female with known untreated pernicious anaemia was admitted with a urosepsis. Her Hb dropped acutely from 90 g/L to 52 g/L during the infection. She required urgent red cell transfusion and parenteral B12, with a prolonged recovery period in the geriatric rehabilitation ward.

megaloblastic_anaemia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory megaloblastic anaemia (Diagnostic challenge)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent anaemia despite B12 and folate supplementation.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female presented with persistent Hb 95 g/L and MCV 112 fL despite six months of B12 and folate therapy. Further investigation including bone marrow biopsy revealed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with megaloblastoid features. This case highlights the importance of considering MDS in patients who fail to respond to conventional megaloblastic therapy.
