  primary_diagnosis: Measles with Secondary Bacterial Pneumonia
  presenting_complaint: Productive cough with green sputum and pleuritic chest pain.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with COPD developed measles during a community outbreak. Following initial improvement of viral symptoms, he suffered a secondary febrile spike and purulent sputum. Sputum culture grew Staphylococcus aureus, requiring a course of intravenous co-amoxiclav alongside measles supportive care.

measles_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Measles with Keratoconjunctivitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe photophobia, eye pain, and blurred vision.
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old male from a refugee background presented with measles and significant ocular involvement. Examination revealed bilateral conjunctivitis and a small corneal ulcer. He was treated with high-dose Vitamin A and topical antibiotics to prevent permanent visual impairment and blindness.

measles_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) post-Measles
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, ataxia, and weakness one week after rash resolution.
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old female presented with sudden neurological deficits shortly after recovering from measles. MRI of the brain showed multifocal white matter lesions consistent with ADEM. She was treated with high-dose methylprednisolone, resulting in significant but incomplete recovery of motor function.

measles_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Haemorrhagic Measles ("Black Measles")
  presenting_complaint: Widespread dusky rash, epistaxis, and haematemesis.
  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old male presented with a fulminant form of measles characterized by a haemorrhagic eruption and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). He required multiple transfusions of fresh frozen plasma and platelets. This life-threatening presentation was managed in the paediatric ICU with intensive haemodynamic support.

measles_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Measles with Severe Diarrhoea and Dehydration
  presenting_complaint: Profuse watery diarrhoea and lethargy.
  summary_of_course: A 2-year-old male presented with a measles rash and concurrent gastrointestinal symptoms. He developed severe metabolic acidosis and 10% dehydration due to persistent diarrhoea. He was admitted for intravenous fluid resuscitation and zinc supplementation, which is critical for reducing measles-related enteropathy.

measles_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Occupational Measles Exposure
  presenting_complaint: Malaise and low-grade fever in a healthcare worker.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old nurse with uncertain vaccination history was exposed to a confirmed measles case. She developed prodromal symptoms and was immediately furloughed. Saliva PCR confirmed measles; her symptoms remained mild, likely due to partial immunity, and she recovered without complications.

measles_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Measles Inclusion Body Encephalitis (MIBE)
  presenting_complaint: Focal seizures and altered mental status.
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old male with a history of renal transplant and immunosuppression presented with neurological symptoms three months after a known measles exposure.

measles_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Congenital Measles
  presenting_complaint: Maculopapular rash and respiratory distress at birth.
  summary_of_course: A neonate was born to a mother who developed a measles rash two days prior to delivery. The infant was born with a generalized rash and required NICU admission for respiratory support and intravenous immunoglobulin. The case highlights the risks of perinatal measles transmission in non-immune mothers.

measles_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Measles with Acute Hepatitis
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice, abdominal pain, and rash.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male presented with a typical measles rash accompanied by significant right upper quadrant pain. Liver function tests showed ALT and AST levels exceeding 1000 U/L, indicating acute viral hepatitis. The hepatitis was self-limiting and resolved as the measles rash faded over the following week.

measles_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Measles complicated by Otitis Media and Mastoiditis
  presenting_complaint: Severe ear pain and post-auricular swelling.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old male developed a secondary bacterial infection following a measles diagnosis. He presented with a bulging tympanic membrane and redness behind the ear. CT imaging confirmed mastoiditis, necessitating a cortical mastoidectomy and a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics.

measles_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Atypical Measles
  presenting_complaint: High fever and peripheral rash starting on wrists and ankles.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male who had received the older killed-measles vaccine in early childhood presented with an unusual rash distribution and high fever. The rash progressed centripetally, mimicking Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Serology confirmed an exaggerated immune response to measles virus, typical of the atypical measles syndrome.

measles_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Measles in HIV-infected Adult
  presenting_complaint: Persistent fever and worsening non-productive cough.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male with poorly controlled HIV (CD4 count <100) presented with measles. He developed severe giant cell pneumonia without the classic rash. Diagnosis was delayed until PCR testing was performed. Despite intensive care and ribavirin, the patient died from respiratory failure.
