hypoparathyroidism_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute post-surgical hypoparathyroidism
  presenting_complaint: Perioral paraesthesia and carpopedal spasm
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented 48 hours after a total thyroidectomy for Graves' disease with worsening tingling in her fingers and lips. Examination revealed a positive Trousseau’s sign and serum adjusted calcium was 1.72 mmol/L with a PTH of 0.4 pmol/L. She was treated with intravenous calcium gluconate followed by oral Alfacalcidol and calcium carbonate, leading to symptomatic improvement.

hypoparathyroidism_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic idiopathic hypoparathyroidism
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent generalized tonic-clonic seizures
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male with a history of learning difficulties was admitted following a first-onset seizure. Investigations revealed profound hypocalcaemia (calcium 1.55 mmol/L), undetectable PTH, and extensive basal ganglia calcification on CT head. He was stabilized on high-dose Vitamin D analogues and remains under long-term endocrine surveillance for seizure control.

hypoparathyroidism_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndrome Type 1 (APS1)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis and muscle cramps
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old girl with known oral candidiasis presented with painful muscle spasms and lethargy. Blood tests confirmed hypocalcaemia and low PTH, alongside new-onset adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease). Genetic testing confirmed an AIRE mutation, and she was started on a complex regimen of replacement hormones and antifungal therapy.

hypoparathyroidism_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Functional hypoparathyroidism due to hypomagnesaemia
  presenting_complaint: Refractory hypocalcaemia and tremors
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with chronic alcohol excess was admitted with malnutrition and tremors. Initial calcium was 1.80 mmol/L and PTH was inappropriately low; however, serum magnesium was critically low at 0.3 mmol/L. PTH secretion normalized rapidly following aggressive magnesium repletion, which subsequently corrected the hypocalcaemia without the need for long-term Vitamin D analogues.

hypoparathyroidism_005:
  primary_diagnosis: DiGeorge Syndrome (22q11.2 deletion)
  presenting_complaint: Neonatal tetany and cyanosis
  summary_of_course: A 4-day-old neonate developed jitteriness and tetanic episodes. Bedside echocardiography showed a truncus arteriosus, and laboratory results confirmed hypocalcaemia with low PTH. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed a 22q11.2 deletion, and the patient required acute calcium supplementation and ongoing multidisciplinary care.

hypoparathyroidism_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic post-surgical hypoparathyroidism with nephrocalcinosis
  presenting_complaint: Routine monitoring of renal function
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female with a 30-year history of hypoparathyroidism post-neck surgery was found to have a rising serum creatinine (Stage 3b CKD). Renal ultrasound demonstrated bilateral nephrocalcinosis due to long-term hypercalciuria from high-dose calcium and Vitamin D therapy. Her treatment was adjusted to include a thiazide diuretic to reduce urinary calcium excretion while maintaining serum calcium at the lower end of the reference range.

hypoparathyroidism_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic hypoparathyroidism
  presenting_complaint: Severe vomiting and tetany
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old woman with known post-surgical hypoparathyroidism presented to A&E with viral gastroenteritis and inability to tolerate oral medications. She developed acute carpopedal spasms and a prolonged QTc interval (510ms) on ECG due to a drop in calcium to 1.65 mmol/L. She required temporary admission for intravenous calcium and fluid resuscitation until her oral intake stabilized.

hypoparathyroidism_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Pseudohypoparathyroidism Type 1A
  presenting_complaint: Short stature and round facies
  summary_of_course: An 18-year-old male was referred for investigation of Albright’s Hereditary Osteodystrophy features, including shortened 4th and 5th metacarpals. Laboratory findings showed low serum calcium but significantly elevated PTH (35 pmol/L), indicating end-organ resistance. He was commenced on Calcitriol to manage the biochemical abnormalities and prevent skeletal complications.

hypoparathyroidism_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Radiation-induced hypoparathyroidism
  presenting_complaint: Progressive lethargy and brain fog
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male who underwent radical neck dissection and radiotherapy for laryngeal carcinoma five years ago presented with vague neurological symptoms. Biochemical screening revealed a serum adjusted calcium of 1.92 mmol/L and a low PTH of 0.8 pmol/L. He was diagnosed with late-onset radiation-induced parathyroid failure and started on Alfacalcidol 0.5mcg daily.

hypoparathyroidism_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe hypocalcaemia with laryngospasm
  presenting_complaint: Acute respiratory distress and stridor
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female presented to the emergency department in extremis with inspiratory stridor. She had undergone a completion thyroidectomy 24 hours prior; emergency IV calcium gluconate was administered for suspected laryngospasm secondary to profound hypocalcaemia (1.58 mmol/L). Her airway symptoms resolved immediately upon calcium infusion, and she was transferred to the HDU for monitoring.

hypoparathyroidism_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Brittle hypoparathyroidism
  presenting_complaint: Fluctuating calcium levels and poor quality of life
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female with post-surgical hypoparathyroidism experienced frequent hospitalizations for both hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia despite optimized oral therapy. Due to "brittle" control and significant impact on daily life, she was commenced on recombinant human parathyroid hormone (rhPTH 1-84). This resulted in a 50% reduction in oral supplement requirements and stabilization of her serum calcium levels.

hypoparathyroidism_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Infiltrative hypoparathyroidism (Haemochromatosis)
  presenting_complaint: Joint pain and skin hyperpigmentation
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with known hereditary haemochromatosis presented with symptoms of hypocalcaemia. Investigations confirmed low PTH and low calcium, attributed to iron deposition in the parathyroid glands. He was managed with venesection for his primary condition and oral calcium/Vitamin D for the secondary hypoparathyroidism.

hypoparathyroidism_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Pregnancy-associated hypoparathyroidism management
  presenting_complaint: Worsening muscle cramps in the third trimester
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant female with pre-existing hypoparathyroidism required frequent dose adjustments of Alfacalcidol. During the third trimester, her calcium requirements increased significantly, but dropped precipitously postpartum, necessitating close monitoring to avoid maternal hypercalcaemia during lactation.

hypoparathyroidism_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Hungry Bone Syndrome (mimicking hypoparathyroidism)
  presenting_complaint: Severe bone pain and profound hypocalcaemia
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male underwent parathyroidectomy for severe primary hyperparathyroidism and osteitis fibrosa cystica. Post-operatively, his calcium dropped to 1.60 mmol/L despite detectable PTH levels, consistent with hungry bone syndrome rather than permanent hypoparathyroidism. He required massive doses of oral calcium and Vitamin D for several months until bone remineralization was complete.

hypoparathyroidism_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild asymptomatic hypoparathyroidism
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding on routine biochemistry
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old female undergoing routine blood tests for hypertension was found to have an adjusted calcium of 2.05 mmol/L. Further testing showed a low PTH of 1.1 pmol/L and normal magnesium/Vitamin D levels. As she was entirely asymptomatic and had no history of neck surgery, she was managed conservatively with dietary advice and 6-monthly monitoring.

hypoparathyroidism_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypoparathyroidism secondary to Wilson's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Tremor and jaundice
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male diagnosed with Wilson's disease presented with hypocalcaemic tetany. Investigations suggested parathyroid dysfunction likely due to copper deposition in the parathyroid tissue. His calcium levels were managed with oral supplements alongside penicillamine for copper chelation.

hypoparathyroidism_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Transient neonatal hypoparathyroidism
  presenting_complaint: Poor feeding and irritability
  summary_of_course: A 2-week-old infant born to a mother with undiagnosed primary hyperparathyroidism presented with low calcium. The high maternal calcium had suppressed the fetal parathyroid glands in utero, leading to transient neonatal hypoparathyroidism. The infant required short-term calcium supplementation for three weeks until his own parathyroid glands regained function.

hypoparathyroidism_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypoparathyroidism with Fahr’s Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Parkinsonism and cognitive decline
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male presented with a resting tremor and progressive memory loss. A CT scan showed dense, symmetrical calcification of the basal ganglia and dentate nuclei. Laboratory workup revealed long-standing, undiagnosed hypoparathyroidism; his neurological symptoms showed partial improvement following the correction of his chronic hypocalcaemia.

hypoparathyroidism_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Treatment-resistant hypoparathyroidism (Malabsorption)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent paraesthesia despite high-dose supplements
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old female with known Coeliac disease and post-surgical hypoparathyroidism struggled to maintain calcium levels above 1.80 mmol/L. Despite taking 5mcg of Alfacalcidol daily, her calcium remained low due to poor intestinal absorption. After strict adherence to a gluten-free diet and switching to liquid formulations, her biochemical control improved significantly.

hypoparathyroidism_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute hypocalcaemic cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath and peripheral oedema
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male presented with signs of congestive heart failure and an ejection fraction of 25% on echocardiography. Bloods showed a calcium of 1.52 mmol/L and low PTH, with no previous history of neck surgery. Following aggressive calcium replacement, his cardiac function normalized over several weeks, confirming a diagnosis of hypocalcaemic cardiomyopathy secondary to idiopathic hypoparathyroidism.
