  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)
  presenting_complaint: Relapsing episodes of leg heaviness and walking instability.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female presented with a subacute, stepwise progression of symmetrical proximal and distal weakness. CSF analysis showed albuminocytologic dissociation, and nerve biopsies confirmed segmental demyelination. She requires maintenance corticosteroids and IVIG to prevent the recurrence of her paralytic gait.

paralytic_gait_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Mononeuritis Multiplex (Vasculitis)
  presenting_complaint: Painful, patchy weakness in both legs and a rash on the shins.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) developed sudden right foot drop followed by left wrist drop. Investigations showed elevated ANCA titres and nerve ischaemia on biopsy. Aggressive immunosuppression with Rituximab halted the progression, though his gait remained impaired.

paralytic_gait_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Compartment Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Excruciating calf pain and inability to move the toes following a crush injury.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old construction worker arrived with a tense, swollen lower leg after a heavy machinery accident. Despite distal pulses being present, he had a complete loss of dorsiflexion. Emergency fasciotomy was performed, but delayed presentation resulted in permanent ischaemic contracture and a paralytic gait.
