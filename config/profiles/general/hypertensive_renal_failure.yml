Admission BP was 192/110 mmHg with a creatinine of 385 micromol/L and hyperkalaemia (K+ 6.2 mmol/L). Following fluid resuscitation, cessation of nephrotoxics, and intensification of antihypertensives, his renal function stabilised at a new baseline of 220 micromol/L.

hypertensive_renal_failure_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Secondary Hypertension and Renal Impairment
  presenting_complaint: Lethargy and facial puffiness.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old boy presented with a blood pressure of 158/98 mmHg (above 95th centile) and periorbital oedema. Bloods showed a creatinine of 175 micromol/L and biopsy confirmed IgA nephropathy with significant crescent formation. He was started on ACE inhibitors and steroids to manage both the primary glomerulonephritis and the secondary hypertensive renal damage.

hypertensive_renal_failure_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Renovascular Hypertension and Ischaemic Nephropathy
  presenting_complaint: Flash pulmonary oedema and refractory hypertension.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female smoker with peripheral vascular disease presented with acute breathlessness and a BP of 210/115 mmHg.

  presenting_complaint: Agitation, palpitations, and dark-coloured urine.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male was brought to the ICU following cocaine ingestion, presenting with a BP of 245/135 mmHg and a CK of 25,000 U/L. Acute kidney injury was noted with a creatinine of 610 micromol/L and anuria. He required emergency haemodialysis for metabolic acidosis and fluid overload before renal function slowly recovered over three weeks.

hypertensive_renal_failure_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Scleroderma Renal Crisis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset hypertension and rapidly rising creatinine.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with known systemic sclerosis presented with a new-onset BP of 195/105 mmHg and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia. Serum creatinine rose from 90 to 310 micromol/L within 48 hours. She was treated urgently with high-dose ACE inhibitors (Captopril), which successfully halted the progression of renal failure, a classic "paradoxical" use of ACEi in this specific hypertensive emergency.

hypertensive_renal_failure_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic Renal Failure due to Over-treatment of Hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Dizziness, falls, and confusion.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old frail male with a baseline BP of 170/90 mmHg was aggressively treated to a target of 120/80 mmHg in the community. He presented with orthostatic hypotension (standing BP 85/50 mmHg) and an AKI stage 3 (creatinine 420 micromol/L, baseline 110). Renal failure was attributed to pre-renal hypoperfusion from over-diuresis and excessive antihypertensive therapy; function improved upon medication reduction.

  presenting_complaint: Flank pain and haematuria.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male with a family history of ADPKD presented with a BP of 155/95 mmHg and palpable abdominal masses. Imaging confirmed multiple bilateral renal cysts and a creatinine of 140 micromol/L. Early aggressive BP control was initiated with Losartan to slow the progression of hypertensive renal damage and cyst growth.

hypertensive_renal_failure_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic and Hypertensive Nephropathy
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral leg swelling and foamy urine.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension for 15 years presented with a BP of 185/100 mmHg and nephrotic-range proteinuria (uPCR 350 mg/mmol). Creatinine was 285 micromol/L with evidence of diabetic retinopathy. The clinical picture was consistent with dual-pathology renal failure, requiring intensive glycaemic and blood pressure management to prevent transition to dialysis.

hypertensive_renal_failure_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypertensive Emergency with Uraemic Pericarditis
  presenting_complaint: Pleuritic chest pain and severe hypertension.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male who had not seen a GP in ten years presented with a BP of 215/125 mmHg and a pericardial friction rub. Investigations revealed a creatinine of 1200 micromol/L and urea of 45 mmol/L, indicating end-stage renal failure presenting acutely. He was stabilised with emergency haemodialysis and started on a long-term renal replacement therapy programme.

hypertensive_renal_failure_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Obstructive Sleep Apnoea-related Resistant Hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Daytime somnolence and resistant hypertension.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old obese male with a BP of 175/100 mmHg despite four agents was found to have a declining GFR (from 55 to 40 ml/min/1.73m²). Sleep studies confirmed severe OSA (AHI 45/hr). Treatment with CPAP and adjustment of nocturnal dosing of antihypertensives led to improved BP control and stabilisation of his renal function.

hypertensive_renal_failure_013:
  primary_diagnosis: IgA Nephropathy with Accelerated Hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Macroscopic haematuria following a sore throat.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented with "cola-coloured" urine and a BP of 190/110 mmHg. Serum creatinine was 225 micromol/L with significant proteinuria. Renal biopsy showed IgA deposits with extensive glomerulosclerosis, indicating that acute hypertensive damage was superimposed on a chronic primary glomerulonephritis.

hypertensive_renal_failure_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypertensive Nephrosclerosis in Afro-Caribbean male
  presenting_complaint: Generalised malaise and pruritus.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male of Afro-Caribbean descent presented with a BP of 200/120 mmHg and a creatinine of 850 micromol/L. Despite the absence of diabetes, he had profound renal failure and left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG. The diagnosis was severe hypertensive nephrosclerosis, a condition with high prevalence and earlier onset in this demographic, necessitating immediate dialysis.

hypertensive_renal_failure_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Renal Infarction and Secondary Hypertensive AKI
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset left-sided loin pain.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with atrial fibrillation and a sub-therapeutic INR presented with acute loin pain and a BP spike of 185/105 mmHg. CT angiography showed a segmental renal infarct; serum creatinine rose from 105 to 215 micromol/L. Management involved anticoagulation and BP control, with renal function partially recovering over the subsequent month.

hypertensive_renal_failure_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Fibromuscular Dysplasia (FMD)
  presenting_complaint: Refractory hypertension in a young patient.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old female presented with a BP of 175/110 mmHg and a creatinine of 160 micromol/L. Digital subtraction angiography showed a "string of beads" appearance of the right renal artery. Balloon angioplasty was performed, resulting in the normalization of blood pressure and restoration of creatinine to 85 micromol/L.

hypertensive_renal_failure_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary Hyperaldosteronism (Conn's Syndrome) with Renal Damage
  presenting_complaint: Muscle weakness and resistant hypertension.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with a BP of 188/108 mmHg was found to have persistent hypokalaemia (K+ 2.7 mmol/L) and a creatinine of 195 micromol/L. An aldosterone-to-renin ratio was significantly elevated, and CT imaging showed a left adrenal adenoma. Long-standing hyperaldosteronism had caused both the hypertension and secondary hypertensive kidney disease.

hypertensive_renal_failure_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 2 Cardiorenal Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Dyspnoea and worsening renal function.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with chronic heart failure and hypertension presented with fluid congestion. Admission BP was 170/95 mmHg with a creatinine of 260 micromol/L (baseline 180). Optimal management of his heart failure and BP using sacubitril/valsartan led to improved cardiac output and a subsequent improvement in renal perfusion and GFR.

hypertensive_renal_failure_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic Hypertensive Renal Impairment
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of high blood pressure during preoperative assessment.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male attending for elective hernia repair was found to have a BP of 195/105 mmHg. Routine bloods showed an unexpected creatinine of 245 micromol/L and eGFR of 25 ml/min/1.73m². Surgery was postponed for urgent renal investigation and BP titration, highlighting the "silent" nature of progressive hypertensive renal failure.

hypertensive_renal_failure_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-Transplant Hypertensive Graft Failure
  presenting_complaint: Rising creatinine 5 years post-renal transplant.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female recipient of a deceased-donor kidney presented with a BP of 180/110 mmHg and a creatinine rise from 120 to 350 micromol/L. Biopsy of the graft showed transplant glomerulopathy and hypertensive changes. Despite intensification of her immunosuppression and antihypertensive regimen, the graft function continued to decline toward failure.
