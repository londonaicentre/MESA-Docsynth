down_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Hirschsprung's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Delayed passage of meconium (>48 hours).
  summary_of_course: Male neonate with Down syndrome features. Rectal suction biopsy performed due to persistent abdominal distension and failure to pass meconium, confirming aganglionosis in the rectosigmoid colon.
