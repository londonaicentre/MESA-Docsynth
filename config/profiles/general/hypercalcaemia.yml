hypercalcaemia_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary hyperparathyroidism
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of raised calcium on routine screening
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female underwent routine blood tests for hypertension monitoring which revealed an adjusted calcium of 2.78 mmol/L (NR 2.20-2.60). Further investigations showed a PTH of 12.4 pmol/L and low-normal phosphate, confirming primary hyperparathyroidism. She remains asymptomatic and is being managed with a "watch and wait" approach in primary care with regular renal function and bone density monitoring.

hypercalcaemia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Humoral hypercalcaemia of malignancy
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, polyuria, and significant weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male smoker presented with a 3-week history of worsening lethargy and altered mental state. Laboratory tests showed a severe hypercalcaemia of 3.92 mmol/L and suppressed PTH; a CT chest revealed a 5cm hilar mass. He was diagnosed with squamous cell lung carcinoma producing PTHrP and required aggressive intravenous rehydration and pamidronate infusion.

hypercalcaemia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Sarcoidosis-associated hypercalcaemia
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath, dry cough, and painful skin nodules
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female presented with erythema nodosum and exertional dyspnoea. Investigations showed an adjusted calcium of 2.95 mmol/L, elevated ACE levels, and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy on X-ray. The hypercalcaemia was attributed to extra-renal 1-alpha-hydroxylase activity in granulomatous tissue and responded well to oral prednisolone therapy.

hypercalcaemia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Multiple myeloma
  presenting_complaint: Severe lower back pain and profound fatigue
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male was admitted with an acute-on-chronic presentation of bone pain and normocytic anaemia. Bloods revealed calcium 3.45 mmol/L and an acute kidney injury with creatinine 240 µmol/L. Serum protein electrophoresis confirmed a monoclonal paraprotein band, and he was started on dexamethasone and bortezomib for multiple myeloma.

hypercalcaemia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia (FHH)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent mild hypercalcaemia despite previous parathyroid surgery
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male presented for a second opinion after a failed parathyroidectomy for presumed PHPT. His calcium remained stable at 2.75 mmol/L with a borderline high PTH and very low urinary calcium excretion (calcium:creatinine clearance ratio <0.01). Genetic testing confirmed a CaSR mutation, and he was advised that no further surgical intervention was required for this benign condition.

hypercalcaemia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Milk-alkali syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Nausea, vomiting, and dizziness
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female with a history of GORD reported consuming large quantities of over-the-counter calcium carbonate antacids. She presented with a calcium of 3.20 mmol/L, metabolic alkalosis, and renal impairment. Symptoms and biochemical abnormalities resolved rapidly within 48 hours of ceasing antacid intake and receiving intravenous saline.

hypercalcaemia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Vitamin D toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Generalised weakness and constipation
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female was found to have a calcium of 3.15 mmol/L during a fall assessment. History revealed she had been taking high-dose Vitamin D supplements (20,000 IU daily) purchased online for several months. Her 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was >375 nmol/L; she required hospitalisation for hydration and cessation of all supplements.

hypercalcaemia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Tertiary hyperparathyroidism
  presenting_complaint: Severe pruritus and bone pain
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with end-stage renal disease on haemodialysis for 12 years developed persistent hypercalcaemia (2.88 mmol/L) and hyperphosphataemia. His PTH was markedly elevated at 145 pmol/L, non-responsive to cinacalcet and phosphate binders. He was referred for a total parathyroidectomy due to the risk of calciphylaxis and symptomatic bone disease.

hypercalcaemia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Lithium-induced hypercalcaemia
  presenting_complaint: Routine monitoring for bipolar disorder
  summary_of_course: A 49-year-old female on long-term lithium therapy showed a gradual rise in serum calcium over two years, reaching 2.74 mmol/L. PTH was inappropriately high-normal at 5.8 pmol/L, suggesting lithium-induced resetting of the calcium-sensing receptor. After consultation with her psychiatrist, she remained on lithium due to mental health stability but was scheduled for annual biochemical monitoring.

hypercalcaemia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Addison's disease
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss, hyperpigmentation, and postural syncope
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male presented in an Addisonian crisis with hypotension and hyponatraemia. Unexpectedly, his calcium was elevated at 2.82 mmol/L, likely due to increased renal calcium reabsorption and haemoconcentration. The hypercalcaemia resolved promptly following hydrocortisone and saline resuscitation.

hypercalcaemia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Thyrotoxicosis-associated hypercalcaemia
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations, heat intolerance, and tremors
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female with Graves' disease presented with thyrotoxic symptoms and a mild hypercalcaemia of 2.72 mmol/L. The elevation was attributed to increased bone turnover stimulated by high thyroid hormone levels. Calcium levels normalised within six weeks of starting carbimazole as she returned to a euthyroid state.

hypercalcaemia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Immobilisation-induced hypercalcaemia
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal pain and constipation following trauma
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male athlete was bedbound for three weeks following multiple lower limb fractures and spinal stabilisation. He developed nausea and a calcium of 3.05 mmol/L with a suppressed PTH. The diagnosis of immobilisation hypercalcaemia was made, and he was treated with intensive physiotherapy and a single dose of zoledronic acid.

hypercalcaemia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Thiazide-unmasked primary hyperparathyroidism
  presenting_complaint: Incidental hypercalcaemia on starting new medication
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male was started on bendroflumethiazide for hypertension; four weeks later, his calcium was 2.84 mmol/L. While thiazides can cause mild elevations, his PTH remained elevated at 9.2 pmol/L after stopping the diuretic for two months. This confirmed that the medication had unmasked pre-existing, subclinical primary hyperparathyroidism.

hypercalcaemia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Williams syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Failure to thrive and "elfin" facial features
  summary_of_course: A 2-year-old boy was referred to paediatrics for developmental delay and irritability. Blood tests revealed an infantile hypercalcaemia of 2.92 mmol/L. Genetic testing confirmed a 7q11.23 microdeletion, and he was managed with a low-calcium diet and avoidance of Vitamin D supplements.

hypercalcaemia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Parathyroid carcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Palpable neck mass and severe symptomatic hypercalcaemia
  summary_of_course: A 53-year-old female presented with a calcium of 4.10 mmol/L and a firm mass in the left lower pole of the thyroid. Her PTH was extremely high at 110 pmol/L. Following emergency stabilisation with fluids and calcitonin, she underwent surgery which confirmed parathyroid carcinoma with vascular invasion.

hypercalcaemia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Tuberculosis-related hypercalcaemia
  presenting_complaint: Chronic cough, night sweats, and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old male recently arrived from a high-prevalence area presented with upper lobe cavitary lesions on CXR. Laboratory findings included a calcium of 2.87 mmol/L and low PTH. Sputum cultures were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and the hypercalcaemia, caused by granulomatous Vitamin D activation, resolved during the intensive phase of antituberculous therapy.

hypercalcaemia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Bone metastases from breast cancer
  presenting_complaint: Severe hip pain and inability to weight-bear
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old female with a history of breast cancer five years prior presented with acute hip pain. X-rays showed multiple lytic lesions in the pelvis and femur, and bloods showed a calcium of 3.58 mmol/L. She received urgent radiotherapy to the hip and intravenous denosumab to manage the malignant hypercalcaemia.

hypercalcaemia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypercalcaemic crisis
  presenting_complaint: Coma and cardiac arrhythmias
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old female was brought to the A&E in a comatose state with a shortened QT interval on ECG. Her adjusted calcium was life-threatening at 4.65 mmol/L. She was admitted to the ICU for haemofiltration after failing to respond sufficiently to aggressive fluid resuscitation and bisphosphonates.

hypercalcaemia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Renal cell carcinoma (Paraneoplastic)
  presenting_complaint: Haematuria and loin pain
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male presented with macroscopic haematuria and a calcium of 3.32 mmol/L. Imaging confirmed a large renal mass with no evidence of bone metastases. The hypercalcaemia was determined to be a paraneoplastic syndrome due to ectopic PTHrP production and resolved completely following a radical nephrectomy.

hypercalcaemia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory hypercalcaemia in Multiple Myeloma
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent nausea and drowsiness despite treatment
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female with relapsed multiple myeloma presented with a calcium of 3.40 mmol/L despite having received zoledronic acid two weeks prior. Due to the refractory nature of the hypercalcaemia and worsening renal function, she was started on denosumab 120mg, which successfully lowered her calcium to 2.55 mmol/L within 7 days.
