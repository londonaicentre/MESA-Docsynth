silent_myocardial_ischaemia_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Silent Myocardial Ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Routine diabetic review; asymptomatic.
  summary_of_course: 72yo male with long-standing Type 2 diabetes and peripheral neuropathy. A routine annual ECG demonstrated significant ST-segment depression in leads V4-V6 that was not present on previous tracings. Subsequent myocardial perfusion scintigraphy revealed a large reversible defect in the anterolateral wall, leading to a diagnosis of silent ischaemia likely due to diabetic autonomic neuropathy.

silent_myocardial_ischaemia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Silent Myocardial Ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Routine post-CABG follow-up; no symptoms.
  summary_of_course: 65yo male who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting three years ago. During a scheduled exercise tolerance test (ETT) for occupational certification, he achieved 10 METS but developed 3mm of planar ST depression in the inferior leads. He remained entirely asymptomatic throughout the test. Coronary angiography confirmed a stenosed vein graft to the RCA, which was successfully treated with a drug-eluting stent.

silent_myocardial_ischaemia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Intra-operative Silent Myocardial Ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Transient ST-segment changes during elective hip arthroplasty.
  summary_of_course: 78yo female with hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia undergoing total hip replacement under general anaesthesia. Anaesthetic monitoring detected sudden ST-segment elevation in lead II lasting five minutes, which resolved with glyceryl trinitrate infusion. Post-operative troponin T was mildly elevated at 45 ng/L, but the patient reported no chest pain or dyspnoea upon awakening.

silent_myocardial_ischaemia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Silent Myocardial Ischaemia (Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy)
  presenting_complaint: Routine surveillance coronary angiography.
  summary_of_course: 45yo female, five years post-orthotopic heart transplant for dilated cardiomyopathy. Because the donor heart is denervated, she is unable to experience typical angina. Annual angiography revealed 80% proximal LAD stenosis despite a lack of clinical symptoms. She was started on intensified immunosuppression and underwent successful PCI to the LAD.

silent_myocardial_ischaemia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Silent Myocardial Ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Pre-operative assessment for renal transplant.
  summary_of_course: 60yo male with end-stage renal disease on haemodialysis. As part of his pre-transplant workup, a dobutamine stress echocardiogram was performed, which identified new regional wall motion abnormalities at peak heart rate. He denied any chest discomfort or shortness of breath during the procedure. Subsequent angiography showed multi-vessel disease, and he was referred for coronary artery bypass surgery before being listed for transplant.

silent_myocardial_ischaemia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Silent Myocardial Ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Occasional palpitations; no chest pain.
  summary_of_course: 52yo female with a history of smoking and obesity. A 24-hour Holter monitor was requested to investigate palpitations, which revealed multiple episodes of significant ST-segment depression (up to 4mm) during normal daily activities. The patient’s diary showed no symptoms during these recorded episodes. A subsequent CT coronary angiogram showed a high-grade lesion in the circumflex artery.

silent_myocardial_ischaemia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Silent Myocardial Ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Routine follow-up after recent NSTEMI.
  summary_of_course: 66yo male recently discharged following an NSTEMI, currently on high-dose beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors. During a follow-up cardiac rehabilitation session, his telemetry showed frequent ventricular ectopy and ST-segment shifts during moderate exertion. He denied any angina, which was attributed to the masking effect of his beta-blocker therapy. His medication was adjusted, and he was scheduled for further ischaemic provocation testing.

silent_myocardial_ischaemia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Silent Myocardial Ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Screening for amateur marathon participation.
  summary_of_course: 38yo male with a family history of premature coronary artery disease. He requested a private cardiac screen including an exercise stress test, which showed 2.5mm ST depression in the lateral leads at high workload. He was asymptomatic and had an excellent exercise capacity. Angiography confirmed a 75% mid-LAD stenosis, and he was advised to undergo PCI before resuming high-intensity training.

silent_myocardial_ischaemia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Silent Myocardial Ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: New onset of "indigestion" and mild fatigue.
  summary_of_course: 82yo female with a history of osteoporosis and mild cognitive impairment. She presented with vague abdominal discomfort that she attributed to reflux, but her GP noted a new irregular pulse. An ECG showed atrial fibrillation and significant T-wave inversion in the precordial leads. Troponin levels were elevated, and a diagnosis of silent ischaemia presenting as an "anginal equivalent" was made.

silent_myocardial_ischaemia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Silent Myocardial Ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Severe intermittent claudication.
  summary_of_course: 70yo male with peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and a 50 pack-year smoking history. His mobility was severely limited by calf pain, which prevented him from reaching a cardiac workload sufficient to trigger angina. A pre-vascular surgery pharmacological stress MRI revealed extensive inducible ischaemia in the RCA and LAD territories. He was diagnosed with silent ischaemia, as his PVD symptoms had effectively masked his cardiac limitations.

silent_myocardial_ischaemia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Silent Myocardial Ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent falls and lightheadedness.
  summary_of_course: 74yo male with Parkinson’s disease and associated autonomic failure. He presented following several syncopal episodes, initially thought to be orthostatic hypotension. However, inpatient telemetry captured an episode of profound ST-segment depression preceding a run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, all while the patient was resting and asymptomatic. He was treated with medical therapy for silent coronary artery disease and an ICD.

silent_myocardial_ischaemia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Silent Myocardial Ischaemia leading to Ischaemic Cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Progressive shortness of breath and ankle oedema.
  summary_of_course: 68yo male with untreated hypertension who presented with signs of congestive heart failure. Echocardiography showed a dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 30% and global hypokinesis. Despite never having experienced chest pain, coronary angiography revealed chronic total occlusion of the RCA and severe triple-vessel disease. He was started on heart failure medications and referred for surgical revascularisation.

silent_myocardial_ischaemia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Silent Myocardial Ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Excessive daytime somnolence and snoring.
  summary_of_course: 55yo male undergoing a sleep study for suspected obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Overnight polysomnography with continuous 12-lead ECG monitoring revealed multiple episodes of ST-segment depression during periods of profound nocturnal desaturation. The patient was unaware of these episodes and denied any nocturnal chest pain. Treatment with CPAP and anti-anginal medication resulted in the resolution of the ischaemic ECG changes.

silent_myocardial_ischaemia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Silent Myocardial Ischaemia (Microvascular)
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding on pre-employment ECG.
  summary_of_course: 50yo female with no traditional risk factors. A routine ECG for a new job showed deep T-wave inversions in leads I, aVL, and V5-V6. She denied any symptoms and had a normal exercise stress test, but a cardiac MRI with stress perfusion demonstrated subendocardial ischaemia consistent with microvascular disease. She was started on a calcium channel blocker and statin for primary prevention.

silent_myocardial_ischaemia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Silent Myocardial Ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Routine review of resistant hypertension.
  summary_of_course: 58yo male with hypertension requiring four agents. A routine ECG showed left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with "strain" pattern, but a follow-up ECG two months later showed dynamic deepening of the ST depression. Although he remained asymptomatic, a stress echo was positive for ischaemia in the lateral wall. Angiography confirmed significant disease in the circumflex artery, which was treated with PCI.

silent_myocardial_ischaemia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Silent Myocardial Ischaemia (Type 2 MI)
  presenting_complaint: Hypotension and confusion in the setting of urosepsis.
  summary_of_course: 75yo female admitted to the ICU with septic shock. Continuous ECG monitoring showed 3mm ST-segment depression in leads II, III, and aVF during a period of severe hypotension, without any subjective distress from the patient. High-sensitivity troponin peaked at 1400 ng/L. Once the sepsis was stabilised, a myocardial perfusion scan confirmed significant inducible ischaemia, and she was managed medically.

silent_myocardial_ischaemia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Silent Myocardial Ischaemia secondary to acute anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Lethargy and melaena.
  summary_of_course: 80yo female with a history of gastric ulcers presented with significant melaena and a haemoglobin of 62 g/L. An admission ECG showed 2mm horizontal ST depression across the precordium despite the patient reporting no chest pain. The ischaemic changes resolved completely following a blood transfusion and stabilisation of her haemoglobin levels. A subsequent outpatient stress test was negative.

silent_myocardial_ischaemia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Cocaine-induced Silent Myocardial Ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Agitation and palpitations following substance misuse.
  summary_of_course: 29yo male presented to A&E with a sympathomimetic toxidrome. ECG revealed transient ST-segment elevation in the lateral leads which resolved with intravenous benzodiazepines. The patient denied any chest pain throughout the episode, even when specifically questioned. Coronary vasospasm was confirmed via provocative testing during a later elective catheterisation, and he was counselled on substance cessation.

silent_myocardial_ischaemia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Silent Myocardial Ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding on CT coronary angiography (CTCA).
  summary_of_course: 48yo male with a strong family history of early MI but no symptoms. He underwent a self-funded CTCA which showed a 90% stenosis in the proximal LAD with a high calcium score. A subsequent fractional flow reserve (FFR) measured via CT was 0.72, indicating haemodynamically significant ischaemia. Despite being asymptomatic, he was started on aggressive medical therapy and underwent elective PCI.

silent_myocardial_ischaemia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Silent Myocardial Ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Annual cardiovascular risk assessment for inflammatory arthritis.
  summary_of_course: 55yo female with severe Rheumatoid Arthritis on methotrexate and prednisolone. Her exercise tolerance was limited by joint pain, so a pharmacological stress MIBI scan was performed. It demonstrated a large area of reversible ischaemia in the RCA territory. She was successfully treated with PCI and aggressive lipid-lowering therapy, highlighting the high risk of silent CAD in patients with chronic systemic inflammation.
