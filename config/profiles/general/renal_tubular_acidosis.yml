  primary_diagnosis: Distal renal tubular acidosis (Type 1)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset generalised muscle weakness and palpitations.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old woman with known Sjögren’s syndrome was admitted with profound quadriparesis. Laboratory tests showed life-threatening hypokalaemia (K+ 1.6 mmol/L) and a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis. She was diagnosed with secondary dRTA and treated with aggressive intravenous potassium replacement followed by long-term alkali therapy, with full recovery of motor function.

renal_tubular_acidosis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Proximal renal tubular acidosis (Type 2)
  presenting_complaint: Bone pain and progressive fatigue.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old man with IgG kappa multiple myeloma developed generalised bone pain and polyuria. Biochemistry showed hypophosphataemia, glycosuria in the presence of normal blood glucose, and aminoaciduria, consistent with Fanconi syndrome. He was diagnosed with Type 2 RTA secondary to light chain cast nephropathy and managed with phosphate supplements and treatment of the underlying malignancy.

renal_tubular_acidosis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Hyperkalaemic renal tubular acidosis (Type 4)
  presenting_complaint: Routine monitoring of chronic kidney disease.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with Type 2 diabetes and Stage 3b CKD was found to have persistent hyperkalaemia (K+ 5.8 mmol/L) despite a low-potassium diet. His plasma renin and aldosterone levels were inappropriately low, confirming hyporeninaemic hypoaldosteronism. His Ramipril was discontinued and he was started on low-dose Fludrocortisone, which successfully stabilised his potassium levels.

renal_tubular_acidosis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Distal renal tubular acidosis (Type 1)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent renal calculi and flank pain.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old woman presented with her third episode of nephrolithiasis in two years. Imaging showed bilateral medullary nephrocalcinosis, and a formal ammonium chloride challenge test confirmed an inability to acidify urine below pH 5.5. She was diagnosed with incomplete dRTA and prescribed potassium citrate to increase urinary citrate levels and prevent further stone formation.

renal_tubular_acidosis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Drug-induced proximal renal tubular acidosis (Type 2)
  presenting_complaint: Polyuria and weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old HIV-positive male on a Tenofovir-containing antiretroviral regimen presented with a six-month history of increased thirst. Labs revealed a metabolic acidosis with significant phosphaturia and low-molecular-weight proteinuria. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was identified as the cause of proximal tubular dysfunction; switching to Tenofovir alafenamide led to gradual resolution of the tubular defects.

renal_tubular_acidosis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Hyperkalaemic renal tubular acidosis (Type 4)
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic hyperkalaemia on preoperative screening.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old woman with osteoarthritis and hypertension was found to have a potassium of 6.2 mmol/L prior to elective hip surgery. History revealed heavy chronic use of Ibuprofen and Naproxen, leading to drug-induced hyporeninaemic hypoaldosteronism. Cessation of NSAIDs and temporary use of a loop diuretic corrected the acidosis and hyperkalaemia within two weeks.

renal_tubular_acidosis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Distal renal tubular acidosis (Type 1)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive hearing loss and rickets.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy presented with bowed legs and bilateral sensorineural deafness. Investigations showed a hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis, hypokalaemia, and nephrocalcinosis on ultrasound. Diagnosis of autosomal recessive dRTA with deafness was made; he required high doses of Shohl's solution to maintain acid-base balance and prevent further skeletal deformities.

renal_tubular_acidosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Mixed renal tubular acidosis (Type 3)
  presenting_complaint: Multiple fractures and developmental delay.
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old girl with a history of osteopetrosis and cerebral calcification presented with a pathological femoral fracture. Biochemical screening revealed features of both proximal and distal RTA (Type 3). Genetic analysis confirmed carbonic anhydrase II deficiency, and she was managed with a multidisciplinary approach focusing on alkali replacement and orthopaedic care.

renal_tubular_acidosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Distal renal tubular acidosis (Type 1)
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice, pruritus, and lethargy.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old woman with Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) was found to have an unexplained normal anion gap metabolic acidosis during a routine clinic visit. Further testing confirmed dRTA, a known association with PBC due to copper deposition or autoimmune tubulitis. She was started on oral bicarbonate supplements, which improved her fatigue and corrected the biochemical abnormalities.

renal_tubular_acidosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Drug-induced distal renal tubular acidosis (Type 1)
  presenting_complaint: Severe malaise and dyspnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old man being treated for systemic aspergillosis with Amphotericin B developed worsening metabolic acidosis and hypokalaemia (K+ 2.2 mmol/L). The drug was identified as causing distal tubular membrane permeability defects. Amphotericin was discontinued in favour of Voriconazole, and the RTA resolved after several weeks of electrolyte supplementation.

renal_tubular_acidosis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Hyperkalaemic renal tubular acidosis (Type 4)
  presenting_complaint: Acute-on-chronic kidney injury and lethargy.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male with Sickle Cell Anaemia presented with a painful crisis and a potassium of 6.5 mmol/L. Despite normal renal perfusion, he exhibited persistent hyperkalaemia and acidosis, attributed to sickle-related tubular damage causing aldosterone resistance. He was managed with aggressive hydration, exchange transfusion, and chronic bicarbonate therapy to mitigate the Type 4 RTA.

renal_tubular_acidosis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Proximal renal tubular acidosis (Type 2)
  presenting_complaint: New onset of tremors and polyuria.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old woman with Wilson’s disease developed features of Fanconi syndrome, including Type 2 RTA. Urinary copper excretion was markedly elevated, and slit-lamp exam showed Kayser-Fleischer rings. Treatment with Penicillamine was initiated to chelate copper, which eventually led to an improvement in her proximal tubular function over 12 months.

renal_tubular_acidosis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Distal renal tubular acidosis (Type 1)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic fatigue and recurrent urinary tract infections.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old woman with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) was investigated for persistent low serum bicarbonate (16 mmol/L). Renal biopsy showed chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, and clinical testing confirmed Type 1 RTA. She was treated with Prednisolone for her SLE flare and long-term potassium citrate to manage the acidosis and prevent stone formation.

renal_tubular_acidosis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Hyperkalaemic renal tubular acidosis (Type 4)
  presenting_complaint: Post-transplant hyperkalaemia.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male, six months post-renal transplant, presented with a stable creatinine but rising potassium (5.9 mmol/L). He was taking Tacrolimus for immunosuppression, which was suspected of causing calcineurin inhibitor-induced Type 4 RTA. Reducing the Tacrolimus dose and adding a small dose of Furosemide successfully normalised his potassium and acid-base status.

renal_tubular_acidosis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Drug-induced proximal renal tubular acidosis (Type 2)
  presenting_complaint: Confusion and metabolic acidosis.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old woman prescribed Topiramate for migraine prophylaxis presented to the A&E with tachypnoea. Arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.31 and HCO3 of 15 mmol/L with a normal anion gap. Topiramate-induced carbonic anhydrase inhibition was diagnosed; the medication was stopped, and her acid-base balance returned to baseline within 72 hours.

renal_tubular_acidosis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Hyperkalaemic renal tubular acidosis (Type 4)
  presenting_complaint: Nausea and palpitations.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old man with chronic obstructive uropathy due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) presented with a potassium of 6.3 mmol/L. The chronic urinary obstruction had led to tubular resistance to aldosterone. Following transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and temporary use of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, his hyperkalaemia and acidosis resolved.

renal_tubular_acidosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Distal renal tubular acidosis (Type 1)
  presenting_complaint: Acute confusion and severe hypokalaemia.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old woman was admitted with profound weakness and a potassium of 1.9 mmol/L after a period of solvent abuse (toluene sniffing). Toluene toxicity was found to cause a transient distal RTA-like picture with high urinary pH and metabolic acidosis. She required intensive care for potassium replacement and cardiac monitoring, with resolution of the tubular defect upon cessation of exposure.

renal_tubular_acidosis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Proximal renal tubular acidosis (Type 2)
  presenting_complaint: Failure to thrive and rickets.
  summary_of_course: An 18-month-old boy with infantile nephropathic cystinosis presented with severe growth retardation and polyuria. He had a full Fanconi syndrome including Type 2 RTA, confirmed by low bicarbonate and high fractional excretion of bicarbonate. He was started on Cysteamine bitartrate and high-dose alkali replacement, though he eventually required renal transplantation in later childhood.

renal_tubular_acidosis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis (Type 1)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent bilateral kidney stones.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old man with a history of five calcium phosphate stones over four years had a normal resting serum bicarbonate. However, a furosemide and fludrocortisone test failed to drop his urine pH below 5.5, confirming incomplete dRTA. Long-term potassium citrate therapy was initiated, which successfully prevented further stone recurrence over a three-year follow-up period.
