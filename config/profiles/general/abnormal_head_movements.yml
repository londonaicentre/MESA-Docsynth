  primary_diagnosis: "Essential tremor"
  presenting_complaint: "Progressive rhythmic head nodding for five years"
  summary_of_course: "A 72-year-old male presented with a chronic, fine 'yes-yes' head titubation that worsens during social stress and improves slightly with alcohol. Neurological examination was otherwise normal with no evidence of bradykinesia or rigidity. He was diagnosed with essential tremor and commenced on Propranolol 40mg twice daily, resulting in a 50% reduction in tremor amplitude."

Examination showed hypertrophy of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle. She was treated with ultrasound-guided Botulinum toxin injections into the affected muscles, providing significant symptomatic relief for three months."

  presenting_complaint: "Resting tremor of the jaw and head"
  summary_of_course: "A 75-year-old male presented with a slow-frequency resting tremor of the chin and head, associated with microphagia and a shuffling gait. Examination revealed 'lead-pipe' rigidity and significant bradykinesia. A DaTscan confirmed reduced dopamine transporter uptake in the striatum, and he showed an excellent clinical response to Co-careldopa."

abnormal_head_movements_011:
  primary_diagnosis: "Spasmus nutans"
  presenting_complaint: "Fine head nodding and shimmering eye movements"
  summary_of_course: "An 18-month-old toddler presented with a triad of low-amplitude head nodding, anomalous head tilt, and fine, pendular nystagmus. MRI of the brain and optic pathways was normal, excluding a chiasmal glioma. The condition was diagnosed as Spasmus nutans, and the movements resolved spontaneously over the following twelve months."

  primary_diagnosis: "Functional Neurological Disorder (FND)"
  presenting_complaint: "Sudden onset erratic head shaking"
  summary_of_course: "A 28-year-old female presented with acute, large-amplitude head movements that were highly variable in frequency and direction. The movements diminished significantly when the patient was asked to perform a complex motor task with her hands (entrainment). Following a normal MRI and EEG, the diagnosis of FND was explained using a biopsychosocial model, and she was referred for specialised physiotherapy."

The patient was diagnosed with sporadic CJD and received palliative care until her death three weeks later."
