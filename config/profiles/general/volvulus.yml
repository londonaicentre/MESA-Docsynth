  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male resident of a nursing home presented with a massively distended, tympanitic abdomen. Abdominal X-ray revealed a classic 'coffee bean' sign. He underwent successful bedside detorsion via a flatus tube with immediate release of gas and faecal matter, followed by an elective sigmoidectomy.

volvulus_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Midgut volvulus
  presenting_complaint: Bilious vomiting and irritability in a neonate.
  summary_of_course: A 4-day-old infant presented to A&E with sudden onset green-tinged emesis and haemodynamic instability. An upper GI contrast study showed a 'corkscrew' appearance of the distal duodenum. The patient underwent an emergency Ladd's procedure for malrotation and midgut volvulus, with viable bowel preserved.

volvulus_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute cecal volvulus
  presenting_complaint: Severe right-sided colicky abdominal pain and vomiting.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female marathon runner presented with acute right lower quadrant pain. CT imaging demonstrated a 'whirl sign' and a dilated cecum displaced into the left upper quadrant. She underwent an emergency right hemicolectomy after intraoperative findings confirmed ischaemic changes to the cecum.

volvulus_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic recurrent sigmoid volvulus
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent episodes of bloating and lower abdominal discomfort.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with a history of chronic constipation reported recurrent episodes of self-limiting abdominal distension over six months. Colonoscopy was unremarkable, but a barium enema during a symptomatic episode confirmed sigmoid volvulus. He was scheduled for an elective laparoscopic sigmoid resection to prevent future strangulation.

volvulus_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute gastric volvulus
  presenting_complaint: Epigastric pain, unproductive retching, and inability to pass an NG tube.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female presented with Borchardt's triad. Chest X-ray showed a large retrocardiac gas-filled viscus. Emergency laparotomy revealed an organoaxial gastric volvulus associated with a large paraoesophageal hernia, which was reduced and repaired with a gastropexy.

volvulus_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Cecal volvulus in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Acute bowel obstruction symptoms in the third trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old female at 34 weeks gestation presented with worsening abdominal pain and vomiting. MRI abdomen identified a cecal volvulus likely precipitated by the gravid uterus. She underwent an emergency laparotomy and a primary cecopexy, with a subsequent healthy delivery via Caesarean section.

volvulus_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Gangrenous sigmoid volvulus
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal pain, peritonitis, and septic shock.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male presented with a rigid abdomen and hypotension. CT confirmed sigmoid volvulus with free intraperitoneal air suggestive of perforation. He underwent an emergency Hartmann's procedure; extensive gangrene of the sigmoid colon was noted, and he required a prolonged ICU stay for vasopressor support.

volvulus_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute midgut volvulus
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent abdominal pain and failure to thrive.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy presented with a history of recurrent, crampy abdominal pain and weight loss. Doppler ultrasound showed a reversed relationship between the SMA and SMV. He was diagnosed with malrotation and subacute midgut volvulus and underwent an elective Ladd's procedure with complete resolution of symptoms.

volvulus_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Compound volvulus (Ileosigmoid knotting)
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressing abdominal pain and clinical collapse.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented with features of high-grade small bowel obstruction and sigmoid distension. Emergency laparotomy revealed ileosigmoid knotting, where the ileum had wrapped around the base of the sigmoid colon. Both segments were gangrenous, requiring double resection and end-to-end anastomoses.

volvulus_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Sigmoid volvulus secondary to megacolon
  presenting_complaint: Massive abdominal distension and lack of bowel movements for four days.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old male with schizophrenia on long-term clozapine therapy presented with drug-induced chronic constipation and acute sigmoid volvulus. Endoscopic detorsion was unsuccessful due to the massive size of the redundant colon. He underwent a subtotal colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis.

volvulus_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Mesenteroaxial gastric volvulus
  presenting_complaint: Chronic intermittent epigastric fullness and early satiety.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with a known hiatus hernia presented with recurring upper abdominal discomfort. Contrast studies confirmed a mesenteroaxial gastric volvulus that partially reduced spontaneously. He underwent a laparoscopic repair of the hiatal defect and an anterior gastropexy.

volvulus_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute cecal volvulus (Mobile cecum syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent right iliac fossa pain and bloating.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male athlete presented with episodic right-sided pain often following heavy exercise. CT during an acute episode showed a 180-degree torsion of the cecum. He was treated with a laparoscopic cecopexy to fix the hypermobile cecum to the lateral abdominal wall.

volvulus_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Sigmoid volvulus with failed decompression
  presenting_complaint: Progressive abdominal distension and vomiting.
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old female with advanced dementia and multiple comorbidities presented with sigmoid volvulus. Rigid sigmoidoscopy and flatus tube insertion failed to achieve detorsion. Due to her extreme frailty and poor prognosis, she was managed conservatively with palliative intent.

volvulus_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Transverse colon volvulus
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of central abdominal pain and absolute constipation.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with a history of prior pelvic surgery presented with atypical bowel obstruction. CT imaging revealed a rare transverse colon volvulus. At laparotomy, the transverse colon was found to be twisted around a narrow mesenteric pedicle; a transverse colectomy was performed.

volvulus_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Sigmoid volvulus in Parkinson's disease
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent abdominal distension and constipation.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with Parkinson's disease presented with his third episode of sigmoid volvulus in one year. While previous episodes were managed with flatus tubes, he requested a definitive solution. He underwent an elective laparoscopic sigmoidectomy to prevent further recurrences.

volvulus_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Adult midgut volvulus
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of generalised abdominal pain and vomiting.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male with no prior surgical history presented with acute-onset severe pain. CT showed the 'whirlpool sign' of the superior mesenteric vessels. Emergency surgery confirmed midgut volvulus due to previously undiagnosed adult malrotation; a Ladd's procedure was successfully performed.

volvulus_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent sigmoid volvulus post-sigmoidopexy
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal pain and distension following previous surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old female who had previously undergone a sigmoidopexy presented with recurrent volvulus symptoms. Imaging confirmed the pexy had failed. She subsequently underwent a formal sigmoid resection and primary anastomosis to provide a definitive cure.

volvulus_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Cecal volvulus secondary to distal obstruction
  presenting_complaint: Right-sided abdominal pain and weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male presented with symptoms of cecal volvulus on CT. Further investigation revealed a stenosing tumour in the sigmoid colon acting as a lead point for proximal colonic distension and subsequent cecal torsion. He underwent a total proctocolectomy to address both the malignancy and the volvulus.

volvulus_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic gastric volvulus
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent chest pain and dysphagia.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female presented with symptoms mimicking gastro-oesophageal reflux. A barium swallow unexpectedly showed a chronic, partially rotated stomach within a large diaphragmatic hernia. She was treated with a laparoscopic reduction, hernia repair, and fundoplication.
