  primary_diagnosis: Mild community-acquired dehydration
  presenting_complaint: Dizziness and dark urine during a heatwave
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male presented to his GP with mild orthostatic symptoms during a summer peak. Examination showed dry mucous membranes but normal turgor and no hypotension. He was successfully managed in the community with oral rehydration salts and advice on increasing fluid intake during hot weather.

volume_depletion_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute pancreatitis with third-space fluid sequestration
  presenting_complaint: Severe epigastric pain radiating to the back
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with gallstone pancreatitis developed significant intravascular volume depletion despite no external fluid loss. The "third-spacing" of fluid into the retroperitoneum caused tachycardia and a rising haematocrit. He required 4.5 litres of IV fluids in the first 18 hours to prevent pancreatic necrosis and support renal function.

volume_depletion_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypochloraemic alkalosis secondary to Pyloric Stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Projectile non-bilious vomiting in a neonate
  summary_of_course: A 6-week-old male infant presented with persistent vomiting and a palpable "olive" mass in the epigastrium. Blood gas analysis showed a classic hypochloraemic, hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis due to gastric acid loss. The infant was rehydrated and electrolyte imbalances were corrected prior to a successful Ramstedt’s pyloromyotomy.
