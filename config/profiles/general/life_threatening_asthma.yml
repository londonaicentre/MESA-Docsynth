  primary_diagnosis: Near-fatal asthma exacerbation
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, drowsiness, and minimal respiratory effort.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with poorly controlled asthma was found unresponsive by family members. In the ED, she was bradycardic with a "normal" PaCO2 of 5.3 kPa in the context of exhaustion, signifying life-threatening disease. She required mechanical ventilation for 72 hours and was discharged on a tapering dose of oral prednisolone and a revised MART regimen.

life_threatening_asthma_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 1 brittle asthma
  presenting_complaint: Persistent wide PEF variability and recurrent severe attacks.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old woman maintained on high-dose ICS/LABA demonstrated diurnal PEF variation >40% despite compliance. She presented with a life-threatening episode (PEF 120 L/min, 30% predicted) triggered by a viral URTI. Management required a prolonged hospital stay with subcutaneous terbutaline infusion before transitioning to biologic therapy with Benralizumab.

  presenting_complaint: Mass casualty presentation of acute severe wheezing during a storm.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old student with mild seasonal hayfever experienced a sudden, life-threatening asthma attack during a high-pollen thunderstorm event. He presented with a PEF of 150 L/min (25% predicted) and subcostal recession. Rapid intervention with back-to-back salbutamol nebulisers and IV hydrocortisone prevented the need for mechanical ventilation.

life_threatening_asthma_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening asthma with pneumomediastinum
  presenting_complaint: Severe retrosternal chest pain and neck swelling during asthma attack.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old boy presented with life-threatening asthma (SpO2 89%, silent chest) complicated by subcutaneous emphysema in the neck. Imaging confirmed pneumomediastinum likely due to the Macklin effect from high alveolar pressures. He was managed conservatively for the air leak while receiving intensive asthma treatment in the paediatric HDU.

life_threatening_asthma_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Steroid-resistant life-threatening asthma
  presenting_complaint: Refractory bronchospasm despite high-dose systemic corticosteroids.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male presented with a life-threatening exacerbation that failed to respond to IV hydrocortisone and standard nebulisers over 24 hours. His PEF remained at 30% predicted with persistent hypercapnia. He was successfully treated with a ketamine infusion and bronchial thermoplasty was later considered as a long-term intervention.

life_threatening_asthma_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Occupational life-threatening asthma
  presenting_complaint: Severe nocturnal dyspnoea and wheeze after work shifts.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old baker presented to the ED at 3 AM with life-threatening asthma (PEF 33% predicted). He had a history of worsening symptoms during the work week which culminated in this acute episode following heavy flour exposure.

  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening asthma in an elderly patient
  presenting_complaint: Wheezing and respiratory distress mimicking heart failure.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with a history of asthma and ischaemic heart disease presented with a silent chest and bibasal crackles. Initially treated for pulmonary oedema, his condition deteriorated until a diagnosis of life-threatening asthma was prioritised based on a PEF of 100 L/min. He responded well to IV magnesium sulphate and cautious nebulisation, avoiding the need for intubation.

life_threatening_asthma_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Near-fatal asthma with hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest following severe asthma attack.
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old female suffered a respiratory arrest due to asthma while waiting for an ambulance. Following successful ROSC, she was admitted to ICU for neuroprotection and management of status asthmaticus. Despite life-threatening pulmonary mechanics, she made a full respiratory recovery but required long-term rehabilitation for mild cognitive deficits.

life_threatening_asthma_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening asthma due to non-compliance
  presenting_complaint: Progressive dyspnoea and exhaustion over three days.
  summary_of_course: A 17-year-old male with a history of multiple ED attendances presented with a silent chest and a PaCO2 of 7.0 kPa. Investigation revealed he had not filled his ICS prescription for six months. He was managed with IV salbutamol and required a transition to a biological agent (Omalizumab) due to the severity of his underlying eosinophilic phenotype.

life_threatening_asthma_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Asthma with Fungal Sensitisation (SAFS)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic severe wheeze with acute life-threatening exacerbation.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male living in a damp environment presented with a PEF of 140 L/min (28% predicted) and severe hypoxia. Skin prick testing and IgE levels confirmed sensitisation to Aspergillus fumigatus. He required a 10-day hospitalisation with IV corticosteroids and was subsequently enrolled in a clinical trial for a new TSLP inhibitor.

life_threatening_asthma_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Exercise-induced life-threatening asthma
  presenting_complaint: Sudden collapse during a competitive cross-country race.
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old girl with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction experienced a life-threatening episode in cold weather. She was found cyanosed with minimal air entry; paramedics administered IM adrenaline thinking it was anaphylaxis, which actually helped the severe bronchospasm. Formal diagnosis of life-threatening asthma was made in the paediatric HDU after ABG showed significant respiratory acidosis.

life_threatening_asthma_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening asthma masquerading as vocal cord dysfunction
  presenting_complaint: Stridor-like noise and severe respiratory distress.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old woman previously diagnosed with vocal cord dysfunction presented with what appeared to be upper airway obstruction. However, flow-volume loops and a PEF of 110 L/min confirmed a life-threatening lower airway component. She was treated with IV magnesium and steroids, and later investigations confirmed severe eosinophilic asthma that had been mislabelled for years.
