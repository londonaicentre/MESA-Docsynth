  presenting_complaint: Intense sneezing, watery eyes, and bilateral malar pressure during hay fever season.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old female with known asthma and severe seasonal allergies presented with acute sinus pressure that failed to respond to over-the-counter antihistamines. Clinical assessment suggested an inflammatory rather than infective aetiology. She was successfully managed with a short course of oral steroids and the addition of a leukotriene receptor antagonist.

  primary_diagnosis: Acute sinusitis in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Facial pain and nasal congestion at 28 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant patient presented with symptoms lasting 12 days.

Her symptoms gradually improved over two weeks without the need for systemic antibiotics.

acute_sinusitis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric acute bacterial sinusitis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent daytime cough and purulent rhinorrhoea for 14 days.
  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old girl was brought to the paediatric clinic with a cough that worsened when lying down and persistent green nasal discharge. Unlike a standard viral URTI, the duration exceeded 10 days without improvement. She was diagnosed with acute bacterial sinusitis and responded well to a paediatric dose of amoxicillin.

acute_sinusitis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute sinusitis in the elderly
  presenting_complaint: Vague facial discomfort, lethargy, and a persistent low-grade fever.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with mild cognitive impairment presented with increased confusion and reduced appetite. Physical examination revealed tenderness over the sinuses and post-nasal drip on oropharyngeal exam. A 7-day course of antibiotics led to a return to his baseline mental state and resolution of the low-grade pyrexia.

acute_sinusitis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Nosocomial acute sinusitis
  presenting_complaint: Unexplained pyrexia and rising inflammatory markers in an ICU patient.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male, intubated for 10 days with a nasogastric tube in situ, developed a new fever. CT of the paranasal sinuses showed fluid levels in the maxillary sinuses bilaterally. The NG tube was removed, and after sinus aspiration confirmed Pseudomonas aeruginosa, targeted IV antibiotics were administered.

  primary_diagnosis: Barotrauma-induced acute sinusitis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, sharp facial pain and epistaxis during a scuba diving ascent.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male experienced "sinus squeeze" while diving, leading to mucosal oedema and secondary infection.

  primary_diagnosis: Isolated acute sphenoid sinusitis
  presenting_complaint: Deep-seated vertex headache and retro-orbital pain.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented with a severe headache that was not relieved by standard analgesia and had no associated nasal discharge. MRI brain, initially performed to rule out intracranial pathology, incidentally showed complete opacification of the sphenoid sinus. She was treated with IV antibiotics and topical steroids, avoiding the high risk of cavernous sinus involvement.

  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic sinusitis in Cystic Fibrosis
  presenting_complaint: Increased sputum production and severe facial pressure in a CF patient.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female with Cystic Fibrosis presented with an acute flare of her chronic sinus disease. Sputum and nasal swabs grew multi-resistant Pseudomonas. She was admitted for a 2-week course of IV tobramycin and intensified sinus douching, which successfully managed the acute exacerbation.

  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent acute bacterial sinusitis
  presenting_complaint: Fourth episode of acute facial pain and purulent discharge within 12 months.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male had multiple successful responses to antibiotics but frequent recurrences. ENT review and CT imaging revealed a significant septal deviation and a concha bullosa obstructing the osteomeatal complex. He was scheduled for elective functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) to improve drainage.

  presenting_complaint: Severe nasal obstruction and anosmia following ingestion of ibuprofen.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male with a history of asthma and nasal polyps (Samter's Triad) developed acute sinus congestion after taking an NSAID for a headache. This triggered a severe inflammatory sinusitis episode. He was treated with high-dose nasal steroids and advised on strict NSAID avoidance and future aspirin desensitisation.

  primary_diagnosis: Post-viral acute rhinosinusitis
  presenting_complaint: Mild maxillary tenderness and thick clear nasal mucus for 8 days.
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old female presented following a confirmed influenza infection. While she had sinus pressure, she remained systemically well with no purulent discharge or fever.
