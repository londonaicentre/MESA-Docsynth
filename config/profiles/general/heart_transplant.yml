  presenting_complaint: Unexplained episodes of nausea and diaphoresis.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male, 6 years post-heart transplant, presented with autonomic symptoms but no chest pain due to cardiac denervation. ECG showed ST-segment depression in the lateral leads, and troponin was significantly elevated. Urgent catheterisation identified a focal stenosis in the LAD, which was treated with a drug-eluting stent.

heart_transplant_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Successful pregnancy post-heart transplant
  presenting_complaint: Management of immunosuppression during second trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female, 4 years post-heart transplant, became pregnant. Her mycophenolate was switched to azathioprine pre-conception to avoid teratogenicity, while tacrolimus levels were monitored closely every two weeks. She delivered a healthy infant at 36 weeks via elective caesarean section with no signs of graft rejection.

heart_transplant_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Tricuspid Regurgitation post-biopsy
  presenting_complaint: Progressive abdominal bloating and peripheral oedema.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male, 2 years post-heart transplant, developed right-sided heart failure. Echocardiography revealed severe tricuspid regurgitation with flail leaflets, suspected to be secondary to chordal damage during repeated endomyocardial biopsies. He underwent successful surgical tricuspid valve repair.

heart_transplant_013:
  primary_diagnosis: New-onset Diabetes After Transplantation (NODAT)
  presenting_complaint: Polyuria, polydipsia, and blurred vision.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female, 6 months post-heart transplant, presented with a fasting glucose of 14 mmol/L. This was attributed to high-dose prednisolone and tacrolimus therapy. She was managed with dietary modifications and metformin, eventually requiring a basal-bolus insulin regimen.
