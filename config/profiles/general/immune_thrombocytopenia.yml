immune_thrombocytopenia_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute paediatric immune thrombocytopenia
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of petechiae and bruising following a viral upper respiratory tract infection.
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old male presented with a widespread non-blanching petechial rash and multiple ecchymoses. Blood tests revealed an isolated platelet count of 8 x 10^9/L with normal haemoglobin and white cell counts. Following a diagnosis of acute ITP, he was managed conservatively with "watch and wait" advice, and his platelet count spontaneously recovered to 160 x 10^9/L within six weeks.

immune_thrombocytopenia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic refractory immune thrombocytopenia
  presenting_complaint: Persistent mucosal bleeding and fatigue despite multiple lines of therapy.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female with a three-year history of ITP presented with worsening menorrhagia and epistaxis. She had previously failed treatment with prednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), and rituximab. She was successfully transitioned to the thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA) romiplostim, maintaining a stable platelet count above 50 x 10^9/L.

immune_thrombocytopenia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe immune thrombocytopenia in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Routine full blood count at 32 weeks gestation showing profound thrombocytopenia.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old pregnant woman was found to have a platelet count of 12 x 10^9/L during a routine antenatal check. Clinical examination was unremarkable except for minor bruising on the limbs. She was treated with oral prednisolone and received IVIg prior to a planned Caesarean section to ensure a safe platelet threshold for regional anaesthesia.

immune_thrombocytopenia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary immune thrombocytopenia (SLE-associated)
  presenting_complaint: Malar rash, arthralgia, and easy bruising.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female presented with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) flares and a concomitant drop in platelets to 22 x 10^9/L. Investigations confirmed positive ANA and anti-dsDNA antibodies alongside isolated thrombocytopenia. Treatment of the underlying SLE with hydroxychloroquine and mycophenolate mofetil resulted in secondary improvement of her platelet count.

immune_thrombocytopenia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic ITP flare post-vaccination
  presenting_complaint: Recurrence of bruising two days after receiving a seasonal influenza vaccination.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with well-controlled chronic ITP (baseline platelets 80-90 x 10^9/L) presented with a drop in platelets to 11 x 10^9/L following immunisation. He was symptomatic with mild haematuria and wet purpura in the oral cavity. A short course of high-dose dexamethasone was administered, leading to a rapid restoration of his baseline platelet levels.

immune_thrombocytopenia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening ITP with intracranial haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Severe headache, vomiting, and reduced Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS).
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male was brought to the A&E with acute neurological deterioration and a platelet count of 3 x 10^9/L. Urgent CT head confirmed a subarachnoid haemorrhage. He was treated aggressively with platelet transfusions, IVIg, and intravenous methylprednisolone, followed by an emergency splenectomy to achieve rapid haemostasis.

immune_thrombocytopenia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic mild immune thrombocytopenia
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of low platelets during an occupational health screening.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male was referred to haematology after a routine blood test showed a platelet count of 74 x 10^9/L. He denied any history of bleeding, bruising, or systemic symptoms, and secondary causes were excluded. He remains under outpatient surveillance with no active treatment required as his counts remain stable and above the clinical bleeding threshold.

immune_thrombocytopenia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Evans syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice, shortness of breath, and petechiae.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male presented with combined autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) and ITP, evidenced by a haemoglobin of 72 g/L and platelets of 15 x 10^9/L. A direct antiglobulin test (DAT) was positive, and a bone marrow biopsy showed erythroid hyperplasia with increased megakaryocytes. He required dual therapy with steroids and rituximab to manage the multi-lineage cytopenia.

immune_thrombocytopenia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: ITP secondary to Helicobacter pylori infection
  presenting_complaint: Epigastric pain and mild bruising.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male with moderate thrombocytopenia (platelets 45 x 10^9/L) was found to be positive for H. pylori via a urea breath test. Following triple therapy for eradication (amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and lansoprazole), his gastrointestinal symptoms resolved. His platelet count subsequently normalised to 185 x 10^9/L without the need for corticosteroids.

immune_thrombocytopenia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Drug-induced thrombocytopenia mimicking ITP
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of purpura after starting quinine for leg cramps.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female presented with a platelet count of 2 x 10^9/L and extensive ecchymoses. Initially diagnosed as acute ITP, further history revealed recent quinine ingestion. Discontinuation of the drug led to a complete recovery of the platelet count within four days, confirming a drug-induced immune mechanism rather than idiopathic ITP.

immune_thrombocytopenia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: ITP in a patient with HIV
  presenting_complaint: Generalised lymphadenopathy and persistent thrombocytopenia.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male was diagnosed with ITP (platelets 25 x 10^9/L) as the presenting feature of an undiagnosed HIV infection. Initial treatment focused on starting highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). As his viral load decreased and CD4 count improved, his platelet count rose to 110 x 10^9/L without specific ITP-directed immunosuppression.

immune_thrombocytopenia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Relapsed ITP post-splenectomy
  presenting_complaint: Recurrence of petechiae five years after surgical management.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male who underwent a splenectomy for refractory ITP in 2018 presented with a sudden drop in platelets to 18 x 10^9/L. A technetium-99m labelled heat-damaged red cell scan identified an accessory spleen in the splenic hilum. He was managed with eltrombopag while considering further surgical intervention or alternative medical therapies.

immune_thrombocytopenia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: ITP with paradoxical venous thromboembolism
  presenting_complaint: Painful, swollen left calf and easy bruising.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with chronic ITP (platelets 28 x 10^9/L) presented with a Doppler-confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Managing the prothrombotic state while the platelet count was low presented a clinical challenge. She was treated with cautious low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) while simultaneously escalating ITP treatment with TPO-RAs to raise the platelet count above 50 x 10^9/L.

immune_thrombocytopenia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe ITP with iron deficiency anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Menorrhagia and symptomatic anaemia.
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old female presented with heavy menstrual bleeding, a platelet count of 32 x 10^9/L, and a haemoglobin of 65 g/L. She was diagnosed with ITP complicated by severe iron deficiency anaemia. Management included intravenous iron, tranexamic acid, and a course of oral dexamethasone to stabilize the platelet count and control the haemorrhage.

immune_thrombocytopenia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: ITP in an elderly patient with multiple comorbidities
  presenting_complaint: Epistaxis in a patient on anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male on apixaban for AF presented with a platelet count of 12 x 10^9/L. His management was complicated by chronic kidney disease (CKD) and heart failure, making high-dose steroids risky due to potential fluid retention and glycaemic instability. He was treated with a lower dose of prednisolone and early introduction of IVIg to mitigate bleeding risk while anticoagulation was temporarily held.

immune_thrombocytopenia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: ITP secondary to Hepatitis C infection
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue and mild bruising noted during routine liver function monitoring.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with chronic Hepatitis C was found to have a platelet count of 55 x 10^9/L. Bone marrow examination confirmed increased megakaryocytes consistent with ITP rather than cirrhosis-related hypersplenism. Treatment with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for Hepatitis C led to a sustained virological response and subsequent resolution of the thrombocytopenia.

immune_thrombocytopenia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic paediatric ITP
  presenting_complaint: Persistent low platelets for over 12 months affecting school attendance and sports.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old male with a 2-year history of ITP maintained platelets between 20-40 x 10^9/L. Despite the lack of severe bleeding, the psychological impact and restriction from contact sports prompted treatment. He was started on eltrombopag, which successfully increased his count to >100 x 10^9/L, allowing him to resume normal adolescent activities.

immune_thrombocytopenia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe acute ITP with "wet" purpura
  presenting_complaint: Blood blisters in the mouth and heavy epistaxis.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female presented to the emergency department with oral haemorrhagic bullae and a platelet count of 1 x 10^9/L. This was classified as a medical emergency due to the high risk of internal haemorrhage. She received immediate IVIg and high-dose methylprednisolone, with her platelet count responding to 45 x 10^9/L within 48 hours.

immune_thrombocytopenia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: ITP refractory to TPO-receptor agonists
  presenting_complaint: Failure to maintain platelet counts despite maximum doses of romiplostim.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male with chronic ITP failed to respond to both eltrombopag and romiplostim. His platelet count remained consistently below 10 x 10^9/L with frequent episodes of bruising. He was eventually enrolled in a clinical trial for a neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) inhibitor, which showed a promising initial rise in his platelet levels.

immune_thrombocytopenia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: ITP presenting as a diagnostic challenge
  presenting_complaint: Isolated thrombocytopenia in a patient with a history of heavy alcohol use.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented with a platelet count of 30 x 10^9/L. Initially attributed to alcoholic liver disease, further investigations showed normal liver morphology and no portal hypertension. A positive response to a trial of prednisolone and the presence of anti-platelet antibodies confirmed a diagnosis of ITP, which had been masked by his lifestyle history.
