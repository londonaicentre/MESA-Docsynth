  primary_diagnosis: Cocaine-induced rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury
  presenting_complaint: Severe muscle pain, weakness, and dark-coloured urine
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male was found immobile following a prolonged cocaine binge. Laboratory results showed a creatine kinase (CK) of 65,000 U/L and a serum creatinine of 450 µmol/L. He was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI and required aggressive fluid resuscitation and temporary haemodialysis.

cocaine_abuse_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Cocaine-induced dilated cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Progressive orthopnoea and peripheral oedema
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male presented with symptoms of congestive heart failure. Echocardiography revealed a dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 25%. Detailed history revealed long-term "social" cocaine use, and the diagnosis of toxic cardiomyopathy was made after excluding ischaemic and valvular causes.

cocaine_abuse_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Infective endocarditis secondary to IV cocaine use
  presenting_complaint: Persistent fever, night sweats, and a new heart murmur
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male who injects cocaine presented with a two-week history of malaise. Blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus, and a transoesophageal echocardiogram showed a 1.2cm vegetation on the tricuspid valve. He required a six-week course of intravenous antibiotics and addiction specialist input.
