  primary_diagnosis: Holiday Heart Syndrome (Alcohol-induced AF)
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of irregular palpitations after a weekend of heavy binge drinking.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male presented to A&E in fast atrial fibrillation. He had no prior cardiac history and normal thyroid function. The rhythm spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm within 12 hours of observation and fluid resuscitation; he was advised on alcohol reduction.

palpitations_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Pheochromocytoma
  presenting_complaint: Paroxysmal episodes of palpitations, profuse sweating, and severe "pounding" headaches.
