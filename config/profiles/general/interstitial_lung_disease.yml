  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old Afro-Caribbean female presented to A&E with erythema nodosum and uveitis. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and mid-zone reticular opacities; transbronchial biopsy confirmed non-caseating granulomas. She responded well to a tapering course of oral Prednisolone with resolution of systemic symptoms.

interstitial_lung_disease_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (Bird Fancier's Lung)
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of fever, chills, and shortness of breath.

She was initiated on Mycophenolate Mofetil to manage both her cutaneous and pulmonary involvement.

interstitial_lung_disease_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Cryptogenic Organising Pneumonia (COP)
  presenting_complaint: Subacute cough and malaise following a viral upper respiratory tract infection.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male failed to respond to multiple courses of community-prescribed antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. CT imaging showed migratory peripheral consolidations and "atoll" signs. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed a mixed pleocytosis, and he achieved rapid clinical and radiological improvement with high-dose steroids.

interstitial_lung_disease_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Amiodarone-induced Pulmonary Toxicity
  presenting_complaint: New-onset non-productive cough and progressive hypoxia.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with atrial fibrillation on long-term Amiodarone presented with subacute respiratory failure. HRCT showed high-attenuation pleuroparenchymal opacities and focal consolidation. The drug was discontinued, and he required ICU admission for high-flow nasal oxygen and pulsed Methylprednisolone.

  primary_diagnosis: Acute Interstitial Pneumonia (Hamman-Rich Syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive breathlessness over 4 days.
  summary_of_course: A previously healthy 45-year-old female presented with fulminant respiratory failure requiring intubation. Investigations ruled out infection and left heart failure; HRCT showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) pattern. Despite aggressive ventilatory support and immunosuppression, the patient sadly succumbed to multi-organ failure.

  primary_diagnosis: Asbestosis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic breathlessness and finger clubbing.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old retired shipyard worker presented with a 5-year history of slowly progressive dyspnoea.

He was diagnosed with asbestosis and supported with pulmonary rehabilitation and assistance with industrial injuries disablement benefit.

interstitial_lung_disease_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset pleuritic chest pain and breathlessness.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female presented with her second spontaneous pneumothorax in 12 months. HRCT thorax demonstrated multiple thin-walled, well-circumscribed cysts distributed uniformly throughout both lungs. VEGF-D levels were elevated, confirming LAM, and she was started on Sirolimus to stabilise lung function.

interstitial_lung_disease_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Rheumatoid Arthritis-associated ILD (RA-ILD)
  presenting_complaint: Exertional breathlessness in a patient with established joint disease.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female with seropositive RA for 15 years reported reduced exercise tolerance. PFTs showed a decline in DLCO to 45% predicted, and HRCT showed a UIP-like pattern of fibrosis. Management was complicated by a history of recurrent chest infections, necessitating careful balance of immunosuppression with Rituximab.

interstitial_lung_disease_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Silicosis (Chronic)
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath and cough with occasional wheeze.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old stone mason presented with upper-lobe predominant nodular opacities on X-ray. HRCT showed "eggshell" calcification of the hilar lymph nodes and conglomerate masses consistent with progressive massive fibrosis (PMF). He was monitored closely for mycobacterial tuberculosis, a known complication of his condition.

  primary_diagnosis: Neuroendocrine Cell Hyperplasia of Infancy (NEHI)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent tachypnoea, retractions, and crackles in a toddler.
  summary_of_course: An 18-month-old boy presented with chronic respiratory distress and failure to thrive since age 4 months. HRCT showed characteristic ground-glass opacities in the right middle lobe and lingula. He remained oxygen-dependent but showed gradual improvement with age, avoiding the need for invasive biopsy.

interstitial_lung_disease_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Desquamative Interstitial Pneumonia (DIP)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive dyspnoea in a heavy smoker.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male smoker (40 pack-years) presented with bibasilar crackles and mild hypoxia. HRCT showed diffuse, uniform ground-glass opacities without significant honeycombing. He achieved significant improvement in symptoms and lung volumes following complete smoking cessation and a moderate course of steroids.

interstitial_lung_disease_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis (PAP)
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath and production of "chunky" white sputum.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male presented with progressive hypoxia and a "crazy paving" pattern on HRCT. Bronchoscopic lavage yielded milky, PAS-positive fluid. He underwent whole-lung lavage under general anaesthesia, resulting in immediate and dramatic improvement in gas exchange.

interstitial_lung_disease_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Antisynthetase Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Breathlessness, muscle weakness, and cracked skin on fingertips.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female presented with "mechanic's hands" and proximal myopathy. Serology was positive for Anti-Jo-1 antibodies, and HRCT confirmed an NSIP pattern of ILD. She was treated with a combination of Prednisolone and Azathioprine, requiring long-term physiotherapy for her associated myositis.

interstitial_lung_disease_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (Fibrotic)
  presenting_complaint: Long-term cough and weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old farmer presented with features mimicking IPF, but HRCT showed upper-lobe predominance and mosaic attenuation (air trapping). Detailed history revealed decades of exposure to mouldy hay. Despite antigen removal, the disease had progressed to a fibrotic stage, requiring treatment with Pirfenidone.

  primary_diagnosis: Acute Exacerbation of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (AE-IPF)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, severe worsening of breathlessness over 48 hours.
  summary_of_course: A 76-year-old with known IPF was admitted with Type 1 respiratory failure. New bilateral ground-glass opacities were seen on CT on a background of pre-existing honeycombing. Despite high-dose IV Methylprednisolone and broad-spectrum antibiotics, he required palliative involvement due to poor prognosis.

interstitial_lung_disease_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Nitrofurantoin-induced ILD
  presenting_complaint: Dry cough and low-grade fever.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female on long-term Nitrofurantoin prophylaxis for recurrent UTIs developed subacute dyspnoea. Bloods showed peripheral eosinophilia and HRCT showed basal infiltrates. Symptoms and radiological changes resolved within weeks of discontinuing the antibiotic.

interstitial_lung_disease_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Combined Pulmonary Fibrosis and Emphysema (CPFE)
  presenting_complaint: Severe breathlessness but relatively normal spirometry.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male smoker presented with NYHA Class III dyspnoea. Spirometry showed an FVC of 95% and FEV1 of 88%, but DLCO was severely reduced at 25%. HRCT confirmed upper-zone emphysema and lower-zone pulmonary fibrosis; he subsequently developed severe pulmonary hypertension.

interstitial_lung_disease_020:
  primary_diagnosis: ANCA-associated Vasculitis (Microscopic Polyangiitis)
  presenting_complaint: Haemoptysis, breathlessness, and dark urine.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male presented with a pulmonary-renal syndrome. Imaging showed diffuse alveolar haemorrhage and underlying interstitial changes. P-ANCA was positive with high MPO titres; he was treated urgently with plasma exchange, Cyclophosphamide, and steroids to prevent permanent renal and pulmonary damage.
