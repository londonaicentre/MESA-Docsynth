MRI showed multiple T2-hyperintense lesions in the periventricular white matter and a fresh gadolinium-enhancing lesion in the left internal capsule. She was treated with high-dose IV methylprednisolone, leading to a partial recovery of motor function.

hemiplegia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Pyogenic cerebral abscess
  presenting_complaint: Fever, worsening headache, and left-sided hemiplegia
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use presented with sepsis and focal neurological signs. CT imaging showed a ring-enhancing lesion in the right parietal lobe, and aspirate confirmed Staphylococcus aureus infection. He required a 6-week course of IV antibiotics and neurosurgical aspiration to resolve the abscess.
