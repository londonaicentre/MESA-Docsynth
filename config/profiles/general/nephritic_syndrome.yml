  primary_diagnosis: Renal-limited Anti-GBM Disease
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of anuria and nausea.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with no prior medical history presented with sudden cessation of urine output and a creatinine of 800 µmol/L. Unlike classic Goodpasture's, there was no lung involvement, but anti-GBM titres were extremely high. Despite intensive plasmapheresis and steroids, she remained anuric and transitioned to long-term renal replacement therapy.

nephritic_syndrome_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Thin Basement Membrane Disease
  presenting_complaint: Incidental microscopic haematuria.
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old girl was found to have persistent microscopic haematuria during a routine school screening. Her blood pressure, GFR, and protein-creatinine ratio were all within normal limits, and her father also had asymptomatic haematuria. She was diagnosed with benign familial haematuria (thin basement membrane disease) and discharged to primary care for annual monitoring.

nephritic_syndrome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Class IV Lupus Nephritis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent haematuria and rising creatinine despite treatment.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female with diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis showed a poor response to standard induction with mycophenolate mofetil. Follow-up biopsy showed persistent active crescents and worsening tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Her regimen was escalated to include belimumab and voclosporin, which eventually achieved a partial clinical response.

  primary_diagnosis: Shiga-toxin Associated Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (STEC-HUS)
  presenting_complaint: Bloody diarrhoea followed by pallor, bruising, and oliguria.
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old boy presented with an acute nephritic-like picture following a gastrointestinal illness. Investigations showed microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. He required temporary peritoneal dialysis and multiple blood transfusions but eventually recovered renal function over several weeks.

nephritic_syndrome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary IgA Nephropathy (Coeliac-associated)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent haematuria and abdominal bloating.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male with poorly controlled Coeliac disease was found to have persistent microscopic haematuria and 1.5g/day proteinuria. Renal biopsy confirmed IgA nephropathy, thought to be secondary to chronic mucosal inflammation. Strict adherence to a gluten-free diet led to a significant reduction in haematuria and stabilization of his renal parameters.

nephritic_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Drug-induced ANCA-associated Vasculitis
  presenting_complaint: Generalised malaise, arthralgia, and dark urine after starting new medication.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female who had been taking hydralazine for long-term hypertension presented with a new nephritic syndrome. Serology revealed high-titre MPO-ANCA and positive anti-histone antibodies. Withdrawal of the hydralazine and a short course of oral prednisolone resulted in a rapid improvement in her GFR and resolution of the haematuria.
