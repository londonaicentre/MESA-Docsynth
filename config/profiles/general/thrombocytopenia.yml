thrombocytopenia_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)
  presenting_complaint: Widespread petechiae and epistaxis following a viral illness.
  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old male presented to A&E with a sudden onset non-blanching rash and nosebleeds. Bloods revealed a platelet count of 8 x 10^9/L with normal haemoglobin and white cell counts. He was diagnosed with acute paediatric ITP and managed conservatively with a single dose of IVIG, resulting in a platelet recovery to 150 x 10^9/L within one week.

thrombocytopenia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Type II
  presenting_complaint: Sudden drop in platelet count six days post-cardiac surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male undergoing CABG was receiving prophylactic unfractionated heparin. On postoperative day 6, his platelet count fell by 60% to 45 x 10^9/L despite no active bleeding. HIT was confirmed via a positive 4Ts score and ELISA for anti-PF4 antibodies; heparin was ceased and anticoagulation switched to argatroban.

thrombocytopenia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Gestational Thrombocytopenia
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of low platelets during routine antenatal screening.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female at 34 weeks gestation was found to have a platelet count of 88 x 10^9/L. She was asymptomatic with no history of hypertension or proteinuria. Following serial monitoring which showed stable counts and a post-partum return to normal levels, she was diagnosed with gestational thrombocytopenia requiring no clinical intervention.

thrombocytopenia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, fever, and jaundice.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female presented with acute neurological deficit and a platelet count of 12 x 10^9/L. Blood film showed prominent schistocytes and a severely reduced ADAMTS13 activity level (<5%). She was urgently treated with plasma exchange and methylprednisolone in the ICU, leading to a gradual stabilisation of her haematological parameters.

thrombocytopenia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Liver Disease-associated Thrombocytopenia
  presenting_complaint: Routine monitoring for compensated cirrhosis.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol-related cirrhosis presented for outpatient review. Investigations showed a stable, chronic thrombocytopenia of 65 x 10^9/L attributed to hypersplenism and reduced thrombopoietin production. No active bleeding was noted, and he was managed with surveillance and advice regarding trauma avoidance.

thrombocytopenia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Chemotherapy-Induced Thrombocytopenia
  presenting_complaint: Easy bruising ten days after cycle 2 of FEC chemotherapy.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female being treated for breast cancer presented with a platelet nadir of 15 x 10^9/L. She was otherwise well with no signs of infection or major haemorrhage. She received a single unit of HLA-matched platelets and her subsequent chemotherapy dose was reduced by 20% to prevent recurrence.

thrombocytopenia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever
  presenting_complaint: High fever, retro-orbital pain, and myalgia following travel to Thailand.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male returned from Southeast Asia and developed acute febrile illness. Laboratory tests confirmed Dengue virus PCR positivity and a plummeting platelet count reaching a minimum of 22 x 10^9/L. He was managed with aggressive fluid resuscitation and close monitoring in the infectious diseases unit until his counts spontaneously recovered on day 10.

thrombocytopenia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Aplastic Anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Extreme lethargy, mucosal bleeding, and recurrent infections.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female presented with pancytopenia, including a platelet count of 5 x 10^9/L and Hb of 62 g/L. Bone marrow trephine biopsy confirmed hypocellularity (<10%) consistent with idiopathic aplastic anaemia. She was commenced on ciclosporin and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) while awaiting a matched unrelated donor for stem cell transplantation.

thrombocytopenia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: HELLP Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Severe right upper quadrant pain and headache at 32 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old primigravida presented with hypertension (170/110 mmHg) and epigastric tenderness. Bloods showed haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and a platelet count of 42 x 10^9/L. An emergency caesarean section was performed, following which her platelet count normalised within 72 hours.

thrombocytopenia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Pseudothrombocytopenia
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic low platelet count on a routine FBC.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male's routine health check showed a platelet count of 38 x 10^9/L. However, he had no clinical signs of bleeding and a repeat blood sample taken in a sodium citrate (blue top) tube revealed a true count of 215 x 10^9/L. The discrepancy was attributed to EDTA-dependent platelet agglutination in the initial sample.

thrombocytopenia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcohol-related Thrombocytopenia
  presenting_complaint: Generalised weakness and malnutrition in a chronic heavy drinker.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with a 100-unit weekly alcohol intake presented with a platelet count of 52 x 10^9/L and macrocytic anaemia. Investigations ruled out cirrhosis but showed folate deficiency and direct marrow suppression from ethanol. Following two weeks of abstinence and vitamin supplementation, his platelet count rose to 145 x 10^9/L.

thrombocytopenia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: SLE-associated Thrombocytopenia
  presenting_complaint: Malar rash, arthralgia, and easy bruising.
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old female was diagnosed with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) following a multi-system presentation. Her haematological profile showed a moderate thrombocytopenia of 35 x 10^9/L, which was immune-mediated. She responded well to oral prednisolone and hydroxychloroquine, with platelets stabilising above 100 x 10^9/L.

thrombocytopenia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)
  presenting_complaint: Oozing from venepuncture sites and surgical wounds in the ICU.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with E. coli urosepsis and multi-organ failure developed acute DIC. Laboratory findings included a platelet count of 28 x 10^9/L, prolonged PT/APTT, and low fibrinogen. Treatment focused on the underlying sepsis alongside blood product replacement, including cryoprecipitate and fresh frozen plasma.

thrombocytopenia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent mild bruising and fatigue in an elderly patient.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female was referred to haematology with a chronic platelet count of 45-55 x 10^9/L. Bone marrow aspirate showed dysplastic changes in the megakaryocytic lineage and a 5q deletion. Given her age and stable symptoms, she was managed with supportive care and occasional tranexamic acid for minor bleeding.

thrombocytopenia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: HIV-associated Thrombocytopenia
  presenting_complaint: Subacute onset of petechiae and weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male presented with a platelet count of 18 x 10^9/L. Subsequent screening revealed a new diagnosis of HIV with a high viral load. Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) led to a gradual resolution of the thrombocytopenia as the viral load became undetectable, confirming HIV as the primary driver.

thrombocytopenia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-Transfusion Purpura (PTP)
  presenting_complaint: Profound bruising one week after a red cell transfusion.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female received two units of red cells for postoperative anaemia. Seven days later, her platelet count dropped to 4 x 10^9/L. Testing identified HPA-1a antibodies in her serum; she was treated successfully with high-dose IVIG, which halted the immune-mediated destruction of both donor and autologous platelets.

thrombocytopenia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Vaccine-induced Immune Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (VITT)
  presenting_complaint: Severe headache and vomiting 12 days post-adenoviral vector vaccination.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old female presented with a platelet count of 32 x 10^9/L and a d-dimer >20,000 ng/mL. Imaging confirmed a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). She was treated with IVIG and non-heparin anticoagulants (fondaparinux), avoiding platelet transfusions as per national guidelines for VITT.

thrombocytopenia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: MYH9-Related Disorder
  presenting_complaint: Lifelong mild thrombocytopenia and family history of hearing loss.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy was investigated for a persistent platelet count of 60 x 10^9/L. Peripheral blood film showed giant platelets and Dohle-like bodies in neutrophils. Genetic testing confirmed a mutation in the MYH9 gene, and the patient was diagnosed with a hereditary macrothrombocytopenia requiring monitoring rather than immunosuppression.

thrombocytopenia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Hepatitis C-related Thrombocytopenia
  presenting_complaint: Incidental low platelets during workup for abnormal LFTs.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male was found to have a platelet count of 72 x 10^9/L and positive HCV serology. The thrombocytopenia was multi-factorial, involving both splenic sequestration and immune-mediated destruction. Following successful treatment with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) and achieving sustained virologic response, his platelet count improved to 115 x 10^9/L.

thrombocytopenia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Chronic ITP
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent mucosal bleeding despite multiple prior therapies.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old female with a 5-year history of ITP failed to maintain a response to prednisolone, rituximab, and splenectomy. Her platelet count remained consistently below 15 x 10^9/L with frequent menorrhagia. She was eventually commenced on the TPO-receptor agonist romiplostim, which successfully maintained her counts between 50 and 80 x 10^9/L.
