pulmonary_aspergilloma_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic pulmonary aspergilloma
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent mild haemoptysis and chronic productive cough.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with a history of treated pulmonary tuberculosis 20 years ago presented with streaks of blood in his sputum. Chest X-ray revealed a 3cm mobile mass within a pre-existing right upper lobe cavity, confirmed by CT as a fungal ball with the Monod sign. Aspergillus fumigatus IgG was significantly elevated (120 mg/L), and he was managed conservatively with tranexamic acid and outpatient monitoring.

pulmonary_aspergilloma_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Simple pulmonary aspergilloma
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding on preoperative chest radiograph.
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old female smoker underwent routine screening prior to elective cholecystectomy, revealing a well-defined opacity in the left apex. High-resolution CT (HRCT) demonstrated a classic aspergilloma within a thin-walled bulla without surrounding parenchymal inflammation. As she was entirely asymptomatic and had normal lung function, she was scheduled for long-term radiological surveillance.

pulmonary_aspergilloma_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening pulmonary aspergilloma
  presenting_complaint: Massive haemoptysis and respiratory distress.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male with known cystic fibrosis and extensive bronchiectasis presented to A&E coughing up approximately 400ml of fresh blood. Urgent CT angiography identified a large fungal ball in the left lower lobe with hypertrophied bronchial arteries. He underwent emergency bronchial artery embolisation (BAE) followed by a successful left lower lobectomy once stabilised.

pulmonary_aspergilloma_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Complex pulmonary aspergilloma
  presenting_complaint: Persistent pleuritic chest pain and weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with underlying sarcoidosis (Stage IV) presented with worsening constitutional symptoms and localised right-sided chest pain. Imaging showed a large aspergilloma in a thick-walled cavity with significant pleural thickening and adjacent consolidation. Due to poor surgical candidacy, he was commenced on long-term oral voriconazole, showing symptomatic improvement at six months.

pulmonary_aspergilloma_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Pulmonary aspergilloma mimicking bronchogenic carcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Cough, lethargy, and a suspicious spiculated mass on imaging.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female with a 40-pack-year smoking history presented with a new lung mass in the right upper lobe. PET-CT showed moderate FDG uptake (SUV max 4.2), raising suspicion for malignancy; however, CT-guided biopsy and subsequent fungal precipitins confirmed an aspergilloma within a chronic emphysematous bulla. No malignant cells were identified, and the patient was managed for fungal disease.

pulmonary_aspergilloma_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute invasive aspergillosis progressing to aspergilloma
  presenting_complaint: Fever, pleuritic pain, and worsening breathlessness.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male on long-term corticosteroids for rheumatoid arthritis developed necrotising pneumonia. Over three months, the necrotic area cavitated and developed a central fungal ball visible on serial CT scans. He was treated with a prolonged course of intravenous amphotericin B followed by oral posaconazole, resulting in stabilisation of the cavity size.

pulmonary_aspergilloma_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Pulmonary aspergilloma with secondary bacterial infection
  presenting_complaint: Purulent sputum, high fever, and increased cough.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female with a known stable aspergilloma in a post-TB cavity presented with acute-on-chronic symptoms. Sputum cultures grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa alongside Aspergillus fumigatus, indicating a secondary bacterial infection of the fungal cavity. She required intravenous ceftazidime and aggressive chest physiotherapy, leading to resolution of the acute sepsis.

pulmonary_aspergilloma_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Multiple pulmonary aspergillomata
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent minor haemoptysis and exertional dyspnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and proximal bronchiectasis was found to have bilateral fungal balls in the upper lobes. Given the multifocal nature of the disease, surgical resection was ruled out. He was managed with long-term itraconazole therapy and regular monitoring of Aspergillus IgG titres and liver function tests.

pulmonary_aspergilloma_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Pulmonary aspergilloma in Ankylosing Spondylitis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic dry cough and upper zone fibrosis on X-ray.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with advanced ankylosing spondylitis and restrictive lung physiology presented with a new cavity in the fibrotic left apex. CT confirmed a small, mobile intracavitary mass consistent with an aspergilloma. Due to his severe spinal deformity and limited respiratory reserve, he was managed conservatively with tranexamic acid as required for minor bleeding.

pulmonary_aspergilloma_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric pulmonary aspergilloma
  presenting_complaint: Persistent cough and failure to thrive in a child with primary ciliary dyskinesia.
  summary_of_course: An 11-year-old girl with PCD and recurrent sinopulmonary infections developed a persistent right middle lobe opacity. CT imaging revealed a small fungal ball within a bronchiectatic segment. She underwent a successful middle lobectomy to prevent future haemorrhagic complications, with excellent post-operative recovery and weight gain.

pulmonary_aspergilloma_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Pulmonary aspergilloma complicating HIV/AIDS
  presenting_complaint: Subacute cough and night sweats.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male with newly diagnosed HIV (CD4 count 150 cells/uL) presented with a cavitary lesion in the right lung. Initially suspected to be TB, cultures were negative, but Aspergillus galactomannan antigen was positive in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Imaging confirmed a developing aspergilloma within the cavity, necessitating combined antiretroviral therapy and antifungal treatment.

pulmonary_aspergilloma_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Spontaneous resolution of pulmonary aspergilloma
  presenting_complaint: Follow-up imaging for a previously documented fungal ball.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with a 2cm aspergilloma in a right upper lobe bulla was seen for routine follow-up. Repeat CT thorax demonstrated that the fungal ball had disappeared, leaving an empty cavity, following a recent severe bacterial chest infection. This rare phenomenon of spontaneous lysis was attributed to the host inflammatory response or bacterial enzymes.

pulmonary_aspergilloma_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Pulmonary aspergilloma with pleural empyema
  presenting_complaint: Severe chest pain, fever, and shortness of breath.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with a known aspergilloma presented with acute pleurisy. Imaging and thoracocentesis confirmed that the fungal cavity had ruptured into the pleural space, causing an Aspergillus empyema. He required emergency chest tube drainage, intrapleural fibrinophytics, and long-term voriconazole, eventually undergoing a complex pleuropneumonectomy.

pulmonary_aspergilloma_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Pulmonary aspergilloma in Silicosis
  presenting_complaint: Worsening breathlessness and occasional blood-stained sputum.
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old former coal miner with progressive massive fibrosis (PMF) and silicosis developed a large cavity in the right upper zone. CT showed a mobile fungal ball within the necrotic centre of a conglomerate mass. Management was challenging due to poor baseline lung function, necessitating palliative care involvement for symptom control of haemoptysis.

pulmonary_aspergilloma_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent pulmonary aspergilloma post-resection
  presenting_complaint: Return of haemoptysis three years after surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female who previously underwent a right upper lobectomy for aspergilloma presented with fresh haemoptysis. New imaging showed a fungal ball developing in a compensatory hyperinflated bulla in the remaining right middle lobe. She was started on long-term oral posaconazole as further surgery was deemed high risk for respiratory failure.

pulmonary_aspergilloma_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Pulmonary aspergilloma in a pregnant patient
  presenting_complaint: Moderate haemoptysis at 24 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant female with childhood bronchiectasis presented with significant haemoptysis. MRI (to avoid radiation) and limited low-dose CT confirmed a small aspergilloma. Management was multidisciplinary, involving obstetricians and pulmonologists, focusing on conservative measures and tranexamic acid, deferring definitive surgical intervention until postpartum.

pulmonary_aspergilloma_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Aspergilloma within a lung sequestrum
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent infections and localized chest pain.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male with an intralobar pulmonary sequestration was found to have a fungal ball within the sequestered segment on CT. This represents an unusual presentation where the aspergillus colonised a congenital malformation. He underwent elective resection of the sequestered lobe with an uneventful recovery.

pulmonary_aspergilloma_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Pulmonary aspergilloma with treatment-resistant Aspergillus
  presenting_complaint: Persistent symptoms despite 12 months of azole therapy.
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis and a large fungal ball failed to respond to itraconazole and voriconazole. Sensitivity testing on sputum culture revealed an azole-resistant strain of Aspergillus fumigatus (TR34/L98H mutation). He was switched to intravenous micafungin cycles as a bridge to potential salvage surgery.

pulmonary_aspergilloma_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Pulmonary aspergilloma in an elderly, frail patient
  presenting_complaint: Chronic cough and mild anaemia.
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old female resident in a nursing home was found to have an aspergilloma in a chronic cavity on a CXR performed for weight loss. Given her advanced dementia and multiple comorbidities, a conservative, palliative approach was adopted. Her anaemia was managed with iron supplementation, and she remained stable with no major haemoptysis.

pulmonary_aspergilloma_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic pulmonary aspergilloma
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of severe haemoptysis and hypovolaemic shock.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with a known, previously stable aspergilloma presented in shock after vomiting a large volume of blood. He was intubated in the ED and underwent emergency rigid bronchoscopy to isolate the bleeding right lung. Following successful embolisation of the bronchial artery, he was transferred to the ICU for stabilization before a planned delayed thoracotomy.
