  presenting_complaint: Post-auricular swelling, erythema, and protruding pinna
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old male presented with high fever and a 3-day history of worsening ear pain following an upper respiratory tract infection. Examination revealed a fluctuant post-auricular mass and anteroinferior displacement of the pinna. CT temporal bones confirmed coalescent mastoiditis with a 1.5cm subperiosteal abscess; he underwent urgent cortical mastoidectomy and grommet insertion, recovering well on intravenous ceftriaxone.

mastoiditis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic mastoiditis secondary to cholesteatoma
  presenting_complaint: Foul-smelling otorrhea and progressive hearing loss
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female with a history of recurrent childhood ear infections presented with persistent, offensive discharge from the left ear. Otoscopy revealed an attic retraction pocket with keratin debris and a marginal perforation. Audiometry showed a 40dB conductive hearing loss, and imaging confirmed mastoid air cell opacification with ossicular chain erosion, requiring a modified radical mastoidectomy.

mastoiditis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Masked mastoiditis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent low-grade earache and muffled hearing
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old girl was treated with oral amoxicillin for acute otitis media two weeks prior. While the acute fever subsided, she remained lethargic with a dull, thickened tympanic membrane and mild mastoid tenderness. CT scan demonstrated significant bony septal breakdown despite the absence of external swelling, leading to a diagnosis of masked mastoiditis treated with intravenous antibiotics and myringotomy.

mastoiditis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Bezold's abscess
  presenting_complaint: Painful neck swelling and torticollis
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old male presented with severe right-sided otalgia followed by a deep-seated swelling in the upper neck. Clinical evaluation identified pus tracking beneath the sternocleidomastoid muscle originating from the mastoid tip. He required surgical drainage of the neck abscess and a mastoidectomy to control the primary source of infection.

mastoiditis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute mastoiditis with sigmoid sinus thrombosis
  presenting_complaint: Severe headache, "picket-fence" fevers, and rigors
  summary_of_course: An 18-year-old female presented with septic symptoms and exquisite mastoid tenderness. Contrast-enhanced MRI/MRV revealed a thrombus in the right sigmoid sinus extending to the internal jugular vein. Management involved high-dose intravenous antibiotics, mastoidectomy to remove the infectious focus, and a period of anticoagulation.

mastoiditis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Gradenigo's syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Retro-orbital pain, diplopia, and persistent ear discharge
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male presented with a classic triad of otorrhea, deep facial pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve, and lateral rectus palsy (VI nerve). Imaging confirmed petrous apicitis as a complication of subacute mastoiditis. He was managed aggressively with intravenous antibiotics and surgical exenteration of the petrous air cells.

mastoiditis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic mastoiditis with facial nerve palsy
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of facial drooping and chronic ear discharge
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with long-standing chronic suppurative otitis media presented with an acute exacerbation and House-Brackmann Grade IV facial nerve palsy. CT showed erosion of the Fallopian canal by inflammatory granulations in the mastoid. Urgent mastoidectomy and facial nerve decompression were performed, resulting in partial recovery of facial function over six months.

mastoiditis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Citelli's abscess
  presenting_complaint: Swelling behind the mastoid tip extending towards the occiput
  summary_of_course: An 11-year-old boy presented with signs of mastoiditis and a painful inflammatory mass posterior to the mastoid process. Pus had perforated through the mastoid cortex into the digastric fossa, tracking towards the occipital bone. The patient underwent incision and drainage of the abscess and a cortical mastoidectomy with successful resolution.

mastoiditis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Mastoiditis with otogenic meningitis
  presenting_complaint: Ear pain followed by neck stiffness and photophobia
  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old female presented with clinical features of meningitis 48 hours after the onset of acute otitis media. Lumbar puncture confirmed bacterial meningitis, and CT imaging showed opacification of the mastoid air cells with tegmen tympani erosion. She was stabilised with neuroprotective measures and intravenous cefotaxime before undergoing mastoid clearance.

mastoiditis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Zygomatic mastoiditis
  presenting_complaint: Painful swelling over the cheekbone and zygomatic arch
  summary_of_course: A 9-year-old male presented with unusual facial swelling anterior to the ear, initially mistaken for parotitis. Further investigation revealed infection spreading from the zygomatic air cells of the temporal bone. Cortical mastoidectomy was required to address the extensive pneumatisation and infection within the zygomatic process.

mastoiditis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent mastoiditis in an immunocompromised patient
  presenting_complaint: Persistent ear pain and low-grade fever
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes presented with his third episode of mastoiditis in twelve months. Cultures grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa, requiring a prolonged course of intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam. Due to the recurrent nature and underlying immunosuppression, a radical mastoidectomy was performed to prevent further intracranial spread.

mastoiditis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Mastoiditis with extradural abscess
  presenting_complaint: Persistent "boring" headache and ear discharge
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male presented with subacute mastoiditis that failed to respond to outpatient oral antibiotics. CT imaging revealed a collection of pus between the mastoid bone and the dura mater of the posterior cranial fossa. He underwent emergency surgery for drainage of the extradural abscess and mastoidectomy, followed by six weeks of intravenous antibiotics.

mastoiditis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Tuberculous mastoiditis
  presenting_complaint: Painless otorrhea and multiple tympanic membrane perforations
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female from an endemic area presented with chronic, watery ear discharge that failed to respond to standard topical and systemic antibiotics. Examination showed multiple small perforations and pale granulations in the middle ear. Biopsy and culture confirmed Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and she was successfully treated with a standard six-month anti-tuberculous chemotherapy regimen.

mastoiditis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-traumatic mastoiditis
  presenting_complaint: Fever and ear pain following a head injury
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male developed acute mastoiditis three weeks after sustaining a temporal bone fracture in a road traffic accident. The fracture line acted as a conduit for infection from the middle ear into the mastoid air cells. Management required addressing the secondary infection and monitoring for potential cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea.

mastoiditis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Mastoiditis with temporal lobe abscess
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, seizures, and severe otalgia
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male was brought to the A&E following a tonic-clonic seizure. MRI demonstrated a 3cm ring-enhancing lesion in the temporal lobe with associated mastoiditis and erosion of the tegmen antri. He required neurosurgical aspiration of the brain abscess followed by a mastoidectomy to remove the primary source of sepsis.

mastoiditis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Luc's abscess
  presenting_complaint: Swelling of the external auditory canal wall
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old girl presented with severe ear pain and a swelling that appeared to be coming from the roof of the ear canal. This rare presentation involved pus tracking from the mastoid antrum through the petrosquamous suture into the external auditory meatus. She was treated with a cortical mastoidectomy and drainage of the subperiosteal collection.

mastoiditis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild acute mastoiditis (Outpatient management)
  presenting_complaint: Ear pain and mild redness behind the ear
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old healthy female presented with early signs of mastoiditis, including retro-auricular tenderness but no fluctuance or pinna displacement. She was admitted for 24 hours of intravenous antibiotics and then transitioned to high-dose oral co-amoxiclav with close outpatient follow-up. Her symptoms resolved completely without the need for surgical intervention.

mastoiditis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Mastoiditis in Down's Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Irritability, fever, and pulling at the ear
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old boy with Down's syndrome and narrow external auditory canals presented with non-specific systemic symptoms. Due to anatomical challenges, the diagnosis was delayed until significant post-auricular erythema appeared. He required grommet insertion and intravenous antibiotics, with a longer hospital stay due to difficulties in monitoring for complications.

mastoiditis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute mastoiditis with MRSA infection
  presenting_complaint: Worsening ear pain despite standard antibiotic therapy
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old male was initially treated for mastoiditis with cefuroxime, but his symptoms progressed with increasing pain and fever. Pus aspirate from a myringotomy grew Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). His treatment was escalated to intravenous vancomycin and a mastoidectomy, leading to eventual recovery.

mastoiditis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Incidental mastoiditis in the elderly
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic opacification on CT head
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male underwent a CT head following a minor fall, which incidentally showed complete opacification of the right mastoid air cells. On directed history, he admitted to mild "fullness" in the ear but no acute pain. Given his age and the risk of masked infection, he was treated with a course of oral antibiotics and referred for outpatient ENT review to rule out underlying malignancy.
