ventricular_tachycardia_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Sustained Monomorphic Ventricular Tachycardia
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset palpitations, lightheadedness, and shortness of breath.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with a history of ischaemic heart disease and previous MI presented with a broad complex tachycardia at 170 bpm. Despite remaining haemodynamically stable initially, he failed to respond to an amiodarone bolus and required synchronised DC cardioversion. Post-procedure ECG confirmed sinus rhythm with Q-waves in the anterior leads, and he was commenced on oral beta-blockers and referred for ICD assessment.

ventricular_tachycardia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT)
  presenting_complaint: Exercise-induced syncope during a football match.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male collapsed while running; bystanders initiated CPR before a spontaneous return of circulation. Exercise tolerance testing induced bidirectional and polymorphic VT at high heart rates, despite a normal resting ECG and echocardiogram. Genetic testing identified a RYR2 mutation, and he was managed with high-dose nadolol and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).

ventricular_tachycardia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Ventricular Tachycardia Storm
  presenting_complaint: Multiple painful ICD shocks over a two-hour period.

  primary_diagnosis: Brugada Syndrome with Polymorphic VT
  presenting_complaint: Nocturnal agonal breathing and syncope.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male of Southeast Asian descent was admitted following a syncopal episode during a febrile illness. His ECG showed coved ST-segment elevation in V1-V2 (Type 1 Brugada pattern), and telemetry captured a run of polymorphic VT. He underwent ICD implantation and was counselled on aggressive fever management and avoidance of specific triggers.

ventricular_tachycardia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Hyperkalaemia-induced Ventricular Tachycardia
  presenting_complaint: Profound weakness and nausea.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) missed two dialysis sessions and presented with a "sine-wave" ECG pattern and a heart rate of 140 bpm. Blood gas revealed a potassium of 8.2 mmol/L. He was treated emergently with intravenous calcium gluconate, insulin-dextrose, and urgent haemodialysis to resolve the life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia.

ventricular_tachycardia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Cocaine-induced Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia
  presenting_complaint: Agitation, chest pain, and collapse.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male presented to A&E after heavy cocaine use, exhibiting severe hypertension and a rapid, irregular wide-complex tachycardia. The rhythm fluctuated between VT and ventricular fibrillation, requiring multiple shocks. Management included intravenous benzodiazepines and phentolamine to counteract the sympathomimetic surge, alongside standard ACLS protocols.

ventricular_tachycardia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Peripartum Cardiomyopathy with VT
  presenting_complaint: Acute breathlessness and palpitations during the third trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female in her 36th week of pregnancy developed sustained VT and acute pulmonary oedema. Echocardiography showed a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%. Following stabilising lidocaine infusion and emergency Caesarean section, she was managed in the ICU with heart failure therapies and eventually showed gradual recovery of LV function.

ventricular_tachycardia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Slow Ventricular Tachycardia
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic, found on routine pre-operative ECG.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male scheduled for hernia repair was found to have a regular wide-complex rhythm at 105 bpm. Despite the slow rate, the morphology was consistent with VT (AV dissociation and fusion beats). Coronary angiography revealed three-vessel disease, and he was started on amiodarone and referred for urgent CABG rather than the elective procedure.

ventricular_tachycardia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Electrolyte-induced VT in Anorexia Nervosa
  presenting_complaint: Dizziness and extreme fatigue.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female with a BMI of 13.5 presented with profound bradycardia interrupted by bursts of non-sustained VT. Laboratory tests showed severe hypomagnesaemia (0.4 mmol/L) and hypophosphataemia. She required cautious electrolyte replacement and telemetry monitoring in a specialist eating disorder unit to prevent sudden cardiac arrest during refeeding.

ventricular_tachycardia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-operative Ventricular Tachycardia
  presenting_complaint: Sudden collapse on the surgical ward.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male, two days post-CABG, developed sustained VT. Initial management with amiodarone was unsuccessful, and he required DC cardioversion. Subsequent investigation found a kinked graft on angiography, which was rectified with a percutaneous stent, leading to resolution of the ventricular irritability.

ventricular_tachycardia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM) with NSVT
  presenting_complaint: Occasional lightheadedness during exertion.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male with known HOCM (septal thickness 32mm) underwent 48-hour Holter monitoring which revealed multiple episodes of asymptomatic non-sustained VT (NSVT). Given the septal thickness and the NSVT, his 5-year risk of sudden cardiac death was calculated as high. He was counselled and subsequently underwent primary prevention ICD implantation.

ventricular_tachycardia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Chagasic Cardiomyopathy with Recurrent VT
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent syncope and palpitations.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male immigrant from Brazil presented with an apical LV aneurysm and recurrent monomorphic VT. Serology confirmed Trypanosoma cruzi infection (Chagas disease). Despite amiodarone therapy, he continued to have VT episodes, eventually requiring an ICD and intensive anti-parasitic treatment combined with heart failure management.

ventricular_tachycardia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Digoxin Toxicity with Bidirectional VT
  presenting_complaint: Yellow-tinted vision, nausea, and palpitations.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female on digoxin and clarithromycin presented with a unique bidirectional VT on ECG. Her digoxin level was found to be 4.2 ng/mL. She was treated with Digoxin-specific antibody fragments (DigiFab), which resulted in the rapid termination of the arrhythmia and restoration of sinus rhythm.

ventricular_tachycardia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Ventricular Tachycardia Storm
  presenting_complaint: Continuous VT despite multiple interventions.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with ischaemic cardiomyopathy developed a VT storm that failed to respond to amiodarone, lidocaine, and multiple DC shocks. He was placed on Extracorporeal Life Support (ECLS) as a bridge to therapy. A left stellate ganglion block was performed to reduce sympathetic drive, which successfully suppressed the arrhythmia and allowed for subsequent catheter ablation.
