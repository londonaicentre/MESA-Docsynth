  presenting_complaint: Found on the floor by a neighbour after being unable to get up for 18 hours.
  summary_of_course: An 89-year-old female was admitted with a 'long lie' after falling in her hallway. Bloods revealed a Creatine Kinase (CK) of 18,000 U/L and a creatinine of 240 µmol/L, indicating acute kidney injury. She received aggressive fluid resuscitation in the high dependency unit (HDU) to prevent further renal damage.

fall_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Multifactorial falls in frailty
  presenting_complaint: Three falls in the last six months with no clear precipitant.
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including hypertension, OA, and mild cognitive impairment underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). Her falls were attributed to polypharmacy (including amitriptyline), poor vision from cataracts, and home environmental hazards. Medication was rationalised and she was enrolled in a community strength and balance programme.

fall_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Shoulder dislocation secondary to epileptic seizure
  presenting_complaint: Fall during a tonic-clonic seizure with subsequent left shoulder deformity and pain.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female with known epilepsy suffered a breakthrough seizure at home. During the event, she fell and sustained an anterior shoulder dislocation, confirmed on X-ray. The dislocation was reduced under sedation in A&E, and her anti-epileptic medication dosage was reviewed by neurology.

fall_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypoglycaemic collapse
  presenting_complaint: Found collapsed and sweaty on the kitchen floor; family noted confusion prior to the fall.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with Type 1 Diabetes presented with an acute fall. Paramedics recorded a capillary blood glucose of 1.8 mmol/L. Following administration of intravenous glucose, his GCS returned to 15 and he sustained only minor soft tissue injuries to his arms; his insulin pump settings were subsequently reviewed.

fall_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Major trauma from fall from height
  presenting_complaint: Fall from a 4-metre ladder onto concrete.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male construction worker was brought to the Major Trauma Centre with a GCS of 8. Primary survey and CT trauma-gram revealed a flail chest, splenic laceration, and a comminuted calcaneal fracture. He was intubated and underwent emergency splenectomy before being stabilised in the ICU.

fall_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-stroke hemiplegic fall
  presenting_complaint: Slipped while transferring from wheelchair to bed, hitting his left side.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male, currently in stroke rehabilitation for dense left-sided hemiparesis, fell during an unassisted transfer. X-rays showed a non-displaced surgical neck of humerus fracture. Management was conservative with a broad arm sling and modified physiotherapy to account for the upper limb injury.

fall_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden room-spinning sensation when tilting head, leading to a fall.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female presented to the ENT clinic after falling while hanging laundry. A positive Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre confirmed BPPV of the right posterior semicircular canal. She was treated successfully with an Epley manoeuvre and remained symptom-free at her two-week follow-up.

fall_015:

A safeguarding referral was initiated, and she was provided with support services while being treated for her rib fracture.

fall_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Skin tear secondary to fall in dementia
  presenting_complaint: Stumbled in the care home garden, sustaining a large pretibial laceration.
  summary_of_course: A 91-year-old male with advanced Alzheimer's disease tripped while wandering. He sustained a Category 3 skin tear on his left shin. Due to his friable skin and anticoagulation (apixaban), the wound required specialist dressing by the tissue viability nurse and a course of antibiotics for secondary cellulitis.

fall_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Complete heart block (Adams-Stokes attack)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden 'drop attack' without warning, resulting in a facial laceration.
  summary_of_course: A 76-year-old female fell suddenly while standing in a queue. An ECG in A&E revealed third-degree atrioventricular block with a ventricular rate of 32 bpm. She was admitted for urgent permanent pacemaker insertion, and her facial wound was sutured; no further falls occurred post-procedure.

fall_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Vertebral compression fracture
  presenting_complaint: Acute lower back pain following a minor slip in the bathroom.
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old female with known osteoporosis slipped but did not hit the floor, 'jarring' her back. Persistent pain led to an MRI spine, which showed an acute T12 wedge compression fracture. She was managed with analgesia, a back brace, and an upgrade in her bone-sparing medication to zoledronic acid.

fall_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Visual impairment related fall
  presenting_complaint: Tripped over a low step in the garden during twilight hours.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male presented with a bruised forehead after a trip. Bedside testing revealed significantly reduced visual acuity bilaterally. Opthalmology review confirmed dense bilateral cataracts; he underwent successful phacoemulsification and lens implantation, which significantly improved his depth perception and mobility.

fall_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Hyponatraemia-induced ataxia and fall
  presenting_complaint: Progressive wobbliness and confusion over three days, culminating in a fall.
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old female was admitted after falling in her hallway. Blood tests showed a serum sodium of 121 mmol/L, likely secondary to recent thiazide diuretic use. She was treated with slow sodium correction and fluid restriction; her gait stabilised as her sodium levels returned to the normal range.
