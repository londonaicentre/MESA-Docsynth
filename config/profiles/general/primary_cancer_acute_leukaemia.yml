  primary_diagnosis: Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia (APL)
  presenting_complaint: Severe epistaxis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old female presented to A&E with uncontrollable nosebleeds and extensive ecchymoses.

  presenting_complaint: Dyspnoea and facial swelling (Superior Vena Cava Obstruction).
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male athlete presented with rapid-onset breathlessness and venous distension across the chest.

  presenting_complaint: Headache, vomiting, and sixth cranial nerve palsy.
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old boy, previously treated for ALL and in remission, presented with signs of raised intracranial pressure.

  primary_diagnosis: Mixed Phenotype Acute Leukaemia (MPAL)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent infections and weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male presented with a two-month history of weight loss and recurrent tonsillitis.

  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old pregnant woman was found to have a Hb of 85 g/L and a platelet count of 40 x 10^9/L during a routine antenatal check. Bone marrow biopsy confirmed AML. Following multidisciplinary discussion, she commenced daunorubicin and cytarabine; the pregnancy was monitored closely, leading to a successful delivery at 32 weeks via C-section before further consolidation.

primary_cancer_acute_leukaemia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Megakaryoblastic Leukaemia (AML-M7)
  presenting_complaint: Pallor and hepatomegaly in a child with Down's Syndrome.
  summary_of_course: A 2-year-old boy with Trisomy 21 presented with increasing paleness and abdominal distension. Peripheral blood film showed large megakaryoblasts. He was diagnosed with AML-M7, a subtype commonly associated with Down's Syndrome, and achieved remission with a reduced-intensity chemotherapy protocol as per international guidelines.

primary_cancer_acute_leukaemia_012:

  presenting_complaint: New onset pancytopenia three years post-breast cancer treatment.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female, who previously received epirubicin and cyclophosphamide for breast carcinoma, presented with malaise. Marrow analysis showed AML with 11q23 abnormalities, consistent with topoisomerase II inhibitor-induced leukaemia. Her prognosis was poor, and she was managed with CPX-351 (liposomal cytarabine/daunorubicin).

primary_cancer_acute_leukaemia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukaemia
  presenting_complaint: Fever and bone marrow failure six months post-transplant.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male presented with neutropenic sepsis six months after an allogeneic stem cell transplant for AML. Marrow trephine confirmed 60% blast recurrence.

primary_cancer_acute_leukaemia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Philadelphia Chromosome-positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (Ph+ ALL)
  presenting_complaint: Generalized lymphadenopathy and night sweats.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female presented with palpable nodes in the neck and axilla. Cytogenetics revealed the t(9;22) translocation (BCR-ABL1). She was treated with a combination of chemotherapy and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) Dasatinib, achieving a molecular complete response before proceeding to a sibling-matched stem cell transplant.

primary_cancer_acute_leukaemia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Myeloid Sarcoma (Extramedullary AML)
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly enlarging orbital mass and proptosis.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male presented with a painful protruding left eye. Biopsy of the orbital mass revealed a granulocytic sarcoma (chloroma). While initial bone marrow was uninvolved, he was treated with systemic AML-induction chemotherapy to prevent progression to overt leukaemic involvement of the marrow.

primary_cancer_acute_leukaemia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Myeloid Leukaemia with Neutropenic Sepsis
  presenting_complaint: High fever, rigors, and hypotension.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male was admitted as a medical emergency with septic shock. Blood cultures grew E. coli, and FBC showed a total white cell count of 0.2 x 10^9/L. Once stabilised with antibiotics and vasopressors, a bone marrow biopsy confirmed underlying AML; due to poor performance status, he was opted for non-intensive Venetoclax and Azacitidine.

primary_cancer_acute_leukaemia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypoplastic Acute Myeloid Leukaemia
  presenting_complaint: Severe pancytopenia mimicking aplastic anaemia.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male presented with recurrent epistaxis and fatigue. Initial marrow aspirate was a 'dry tap', but the trephine biopsy showed a hypocellular marrow with 30% interstitial blasts. This rare hypoplastic variant of AML was treated with low-dose cytarabine, but the patient required frequent red cell and platelet support.

primary_cancer_acute_leukaemia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (Incidental)
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic; abnormal FBC during pre-operative screening.
  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old boy underwent routine bloods prior to an elective tonsillectomy. The FBC unexpectedly showed a lymphocytosis of 15 x 10^9/L with many 'smear cells' and 20% blasts. He was urgently referred to paediatric oncology where B-ALL was confirmed; he started induction therapy immediately despite being clinically well.

primary_cancer_acute_leukaemia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Blast Crisis of Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia
  presenting_complaint: Sudden clinical deterioration in a patient with known CML.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with long-standing CML on Imatinib presented with a sudden onset of fever and rapid splenic enlargement. Peripheral blood showed 35% blasts, indicating a transition from chronic phase to myeloid blast crisis. He was treated with high-dose chemotherapy and Ponatinib as a bridge to an urgent allogeneic transplant.

  primary_diagnosis: Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (Palliative)
  presenting_complaint: Extreme frailty and bruising in an elderly patient.
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old female with advanced dementia and multiple comorbidities was diagnosed with AML after presenting with extensive bruising. Following a multidisciplinary team (MDT) review and discussion with her family, a palliative approach was agreed upon. She was managed in a community hospice setting with focus on symptom control and blood product support as required.
