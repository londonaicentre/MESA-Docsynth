  summary_of_course: "A 78-year-old male with a history of ischaemic heart disease presented with acute respiratory distress and a BP of 190/110 mmHg. Clinical examination revealed bilateral basal crackles and a gallop rhythm, while the chest X-ray showed classic batwing perihilar opacities. He was treated with high-flow oxygen, intravenous furosemide, and CPAP, resulting in rapid symptomatic improvement and eventual discharge on optimised ACE inhibitors."
