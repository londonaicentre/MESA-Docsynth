  presenting_complaint: Subacute onset of chest discomfort and mild hypoxia 6 hours post-procedure.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male underwent permanent pacemaker insertion via the left subclavian vein. Several hours later, he reported worsening chest tightness and required 4L/min oxygen to maintain saturations. An urgent chest X-ray revealed a developing tension pneumothorax with early tracheal deviation, which was successfully treated with a 12Fr chest drain.

tension_pneumothorax_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Bilateral Tension Pneumothoraces
  presenting_complaint: Apnoea and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) following a blast injury.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female was brought to the hospital after an industrial explosion with severe blast lung injuries. During resuscitation for PEA arrest, bilateral tension pneumothoraces were diagnosed clinically and treated with bilateral finger thoracostomies. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved immediately following decompression of the pleural spaces.

tension_pneumothorax_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Tension Pneumothorax following Thoracocentesis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden coughing fit followed by severe breathlessness during pleural fluid drainage.
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male with a large malignant pleural effusion was undergoing therapeutic thoracocentesis. During the removal of 1.5L of fluid, he developed an intractable cough and sudden-onset hypotension. Bedside ultrasound showed a large air collection with a shifting mediastinum, confirmed as an iatrogenic tension pneumothorax requiring immediate drain placement.

tension_pneumothorax_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary Spontaneous Tension Pneumothorax (Cystic Fibrosis)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden acute respiratory failure in a patient with known Cystic Fibrosis.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old female with Cystic Fibrosis and extensive bullous disease presented with sudden hypoxia and right-sided chest pain. Despite her chronic lung changes, the acute deviation of the heart on X-ray pointed to a tension pneumothorax. Due to the high risk of recurrence, she was treated with a chest drain followed by an early surgical referral for pleurectomy.

tension_pneumothorax_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Barotrauma-induced Tension Pneumothorax
  presenting_complaint: Severe chest pain and neurological deficits after a rapid SCUBA ascent.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old diver presented after an emergency ascent from 20 metres. He was confused and hypotensive with unilateral absent breath sounds.

  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Tension Pneumothorax with Re-expansion Pulmonary Oedema
  presenting_complaint: Progressive breathlessness over three days, now unable to speak in full sentences.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male presented with a three-day history of worsening dyspnoea and right-sided chest pain. Imaging showed a large tension pneumothorax that had likely developed subacutely. Following rapid decompression with a chest drain, he developed severe cough and frothy sputum, diagnosed as re-expansion pulmonary oedema, necessitating CPAP support in the ICU.

tension_pneumothorax_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Tension Pneumothorax (Foreign Body Aspiration)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of wheeze and gasping after playing with small toys.
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old child was brought to A&E with acute respiratory distress and unilateral hyper-expansion of the left chest. A "ball-valve" obstruction from a suspected aspirated toy had caused a tension pneumothorax due to air trapping. He underwent emergency needle decompression followed by bronchoscopic removal of the foreign body.

tension_pneumothorax_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Catamenial Tension Pneumothorax
  presenting_complaint: Cyclical right-sided chest pain and sudden severe dyspnoea during menstruation.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old female with a history of pelvic endometriosis presented with her third episode of pneumothorax, which on this occasion showed clinical signs of tension including hypotension. She was stabilised with an intercostal drain. She subsequently underwent VATS, which revealed diaphragmatic endometriosis implants that were excised to prevent recurrence.

  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic Tension Pneumothorax (Acupuncture)
  presenting_complaint: Increasing shortness of breath 12 hours after an acupuncture session.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented to the emergency department with subacute chest pain and dyspnoea following acupuncture to her upper back and neck. Clinical examination and X-ray revealed a right-sided tension pneumothorax with significant mediastinal shift. She was treated with a small-bore Seldinger chest drain and made a full recovery within 48 hours.

tension_pneumothorax_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary Spontaneous Tension Pneumothorax (Pneumocystis Jirovecii)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden severe hypoxia in an HIV-positive patient with pneumonia.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male with PJP pneumonia suddenly deteriorated with oxygen saturations falling to 70% on high-flow mask and a drop in systolic blood pressure to 70 mmHg. A bedside ultrasound confirmed a tension pneumothorax, likely caused by the rupture of a subpleural cyst. Immediate decompression was performed, though his recovery was prolonged by his underlying immunosuppression.

tension_pneumothorax_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Tension Pneumothorax following Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation
  presenting_complaint: Difficult ventilation and rising airway pressures during cardiac arrest resuscitation.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female suffered an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. During high-quality CPR, the paramedics noted increasing resistance to bag-valve-mask ventilation and absent left-sided breath sounds. Bilateral needle decompression was performed empirically for suspected tension pneumothorax from rib fractures, leading to ROSC and subsequent chest drain insertion in the hospital.
