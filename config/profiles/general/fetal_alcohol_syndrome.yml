  primary_diagnosis: Fetal alcohol syndrome with congenital heart disease
  presenting_complaint: Cyanosis and heart murmur in infancy
  summary_of_course: 4-month-old infant with classic FAS facial features presented with respiratory distress. Imaging revealed Tetralogy of Fallot, requiring urgent surgical intervention. Post-operative recovery was complicated by poor feeding and slow weight gain, typical of the FAS phenotype.

fetal_alcohol_syndrome_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Fetal alcohol syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Significant fine motor coordination deficits
  summary_of_course: 6-year-old female presenting with inability to use cutlery or dress herself. Assessment revealed characteristic FAS dysmorphology and significant impairment in fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination. Occupational therapy was initiated alongside a structured school environment to manage sensory processing issues.

fetal_alcohol_syndrome_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Fetal alcohol syndrome with renal anomalies
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent urinary tract infections
  summary_of_course: 5-year-old boy with known FAS and growth restriction presented with his third UTI in six months. Renal ultrasound identified a horseshoe kidney, a known alcohol-related birth defect (ARBD). Management included prophylactic antibiotics and long-term monitoring by paediatric urology.

fetal_alcohol_syndrome_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Fetal alcohol syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Severe sleep disturbance and night terrors
  summary_of_course: 9-year-old girl with FAS presenting with chronic insomnia and frequent nocturnal awakenings. Sleep studies showed fragmented sleep architecture but no apnoea. Treatment with low-dose melatonin and strict sleep hygiene provided partial relief, reflecting common CNS dysregulation in FAS.

fetal_alcohol_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Fetal alcohol syndrome with skeletal abnormalities
  presenting_complaint: Limited elbow extension and wrist rotation
  summary_of_course: 8-year-old male with FAS features noted to have restricted upper limb movement. X-rays confirmed bilateral radioulnar synostosis. This skeletal complication, combined with his neurodevelopmental profile, necessitated adapted physical education and physiotherapy.

fetal_alcohol_syndrome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Fetal alcohol syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Conduct disorder and substance misuse risk
  summary_of_course: 15-year-old adolescent with FAS presenting with increasing truanting and volatile behaviour. Despite early intervention, he developed secondary disabilities including depression and early-onset alcohol experimentation. Intensive family therapy and youth justice support were engaged to mitigate long-term risks.

fetal_alcohol_syndrome_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Fetal alcohol syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Vision problems and squint
  summary_of_course: 4-year-old child with FAS referred by health visitor for an inward-turning eye. Ophthalmological exam revealed bilateral esotropia and optic nerve hypoplasia. Corrective surgery and patching were required, highlighting the sensory impairments frequently associated with the syndrome.

fetal_alcohol_syndrome_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Fetal alcohol syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Acute behavioural escalation in a hospital setting
  summary_of_course: 11-year-old boy with FAS admitted for an elective procedure became acutely agitated and aggressive due to sensory overload. The clinical team implemented a low-stimulus environment and used pictorial communication tools. This case highlights the need for FAS-informed care in acute medical settings.

fetal_alcohol_syndrome_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Fetal alcohol syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Chronic hearing loss and speech delay
  summary_of_course: 3-year-old male with FAS facial phenotype and microcephaly. Audiometry confirmed persistent conductive hearing loss due to recurrent otitis media with effusion (glue ear). Myringotomy and grommet insertion were performed to facilitate speech and language development.

  primary_diagnosis: Fetal alcohol syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Late-onset cognitive decline in an older adult
  summary_of_course: 55-year-old female with a childhood diagnosis of FAS presenting with worsening memory and executive function. Neuropsychological testing suggested early-onset cognitive impairment beyond expected FAS baseline. Management focused on supportive care and environmental modifications in a supervised living facility.

fetal_alcohol_syndrome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Fetal alcohol syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Poor weight gain despite adequate caloric intake
  summary_of_course: 18-month-old toddler with FAS exhibiting severe postnatal growth deficiency. Extensive GI workup was negative for malabsorption, confirming the primary growth restriction inherent to the syndrome. High-calorie supplementation was started, but growth remained below the 0.4th centile.

fetal_alcohol_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Fetal alcohol syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty with mathematical concepts and abstract reasoning
  summary_of_course: 13-year-old girl with FAS performing at a primary school level in numeracy despite average verbal skills. Dyscalculia and poor working memory were identified as part of her FAS neurodevelopmental profile. Specialist 1:1 educational support was implemented to target her specific learning deficits.

  primary_diagnosis: Fetal alcohol syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Microcephaly and jitteriness in a neonate
  summary_of_course: Full-term infant born to a mother with known alcohol dependence. The neonate displayed severe microcephaly, a smooth philtrum, and signs of neonatal withdrawal syndrome. Treatment involved supportive care in the NNU and long-term referral to the FASD specialist clinic for developmental surveillance.

fetal_alcohol_syndrome_020:

  summary_of_course: 14-year-old male in long-term foster care with a history of prenatal exposure. Physical exam showed clinodactyly and characteristic facial features, while motor assessment revealed significant dyspraxia. Diagnosis of FAS allowed for the implementation of an Education, Health and Care (EHC) plan.
