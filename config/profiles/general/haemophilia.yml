haemophilia_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Haemophilia A
  presenting_complaint: Large soft tissue haematoma on the right thigh and excessive bruising.
  summary_of_course: 10-month-old male infant presented with a significant swelling on the thigh after starting to crawl. Laboratory tests revealed a Factor VIII level of <1%, confirming severe haemophilia A. He was commenced on recombinant Factor VIII prophylaxis and his parents were referred for genetic counselling.

haemophilia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate Haemophilia B
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent swelling and pain in the left ankle.
  summary_of_course: 34-year-old male with known Factor IX deficiency (level 3%) presented with chronic haemophilic arthropathy. Despite previous on-demand treatment, he now requires regular physiotherapy and a transition to a prophylactic Factor IX regimen to prevent further joint destruction. He is currently being assessed for orthopaedic intervention.

haemophilia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Haemophilia A
  presenting_complaint: Prolonged post-operative bleeding following a total hip replacement.
  summary_of_course: 68-year-old male with no prior bleeding history experienced unexpected wound oozing and a significant drop in haemoglobin post-surgery. Investigations found a Factor VIII level of 12%, leading to a new diagnosis of mild haemophilia A. He was managed with intravenous tranexamic acid and Factor VIII concentrates with good effect.

haemophilia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Haemophilia A with high-titre inhibitors
  presenting_complaint: Life-threatening intracranial haemorrhage following a minor head injury.
  summary_of_course: 6-year-old male with known severe haemophilia A and a history of inhibitors presented with vomiting and altered consciousness. CT head showed a large subdural haematoma. He was treated urgently with bypassing agents (FEIBA and Recombinant Factor VIIa) and underwent neurosurgical evacuation, subsequently starting emicizumab for long-term prophylaxis.

haemophilia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Acquired Haemophilia A
  presenting_complaint: Spontaneous extensive ecchymoses and a large retroperitoneal haematoma.
  summary_of_course: 79-year-old female with a background of rheumatoid arthritis presented with sudden onset bruising and abdominal pain. Coagulation screen showed an isolated prolonged APTT that did not correct on mixing studies, and a Factor VIII inhibitor titre of 45 Bethesda Units was detected. She was treated with immunosuppression (steroids and cyclophosphamide) and bypassing agents to control bleeding.

haemophilia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Haemophilia B Leyden
  presenting_complaint: Frequent epistaxis and easy bruising in early childhood.
  summary_of_course: 13-year-old male originally diagnosed with severe Factor IX deficiency (level <1%) at age 2. Recent monitoring showed a spontaneous rise in Factor IX levels to 25% coinciding with the onset of puberty. This rare variant, Haemophilia B Leyden, is characterised by androgen-dependent recovery of Factor IX production.

haemophilia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Haemophilia A with HIV and Hepatitis C co-infection
  presenting_complaint: Chronic right knee pain and restricted mobility.
  summary_of_course: 52-year-old male who contracted HIV and HCV via contaminated blood products in the 1980s. He presents with end-stage haemophilic arthropathy and liver cirrhosis. Management is complex, involving multidisciplinary care between haematology, hepatology, and infectious diseases, focusing on pain management and Factor VIII prophylaxis during liver biopsy.

haemophilia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Haemophilia B in a symptomatic carrier
  presenting_complaint: Menorrhagia and prolonged bleeding after dental extraction.
  summary_of_course: 29-year-old female with a family history of haemophilia B. Her Factor IX level was found to be 32%, which is low enough to cause symptomatic bleeding despite being a carrier. She was successfully managed with tranexamic acid for menses and pre-procedure Factor IX concentrate for her dental work.

haemophilia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Haemophilia A
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of severe groin pain and inability to extend the right hip.
  summary_of_course: 22-year-old male presented with a spontaneous iliopsoas haemorrhage confirmed by CT. He exhibited signs of femoral nerve palsy due to compression. He was admitted for continuous Factor VIII infusion and strict bed rest, followed by intensive rehabilitation, resulting in full neurological recovery.

haemophilia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate Haemophilia A
  presenting_complaint: Persistent bleeding from a tongue laceration.
  summary_of_course: 5-year-old male with Factor VIII level of 4% sustained a minor trauma to the mouth. Local measures and tranexamic acid failed to stop the bleeding over 6 hours. He required a single dose of Factor VIII concentrate in the A&E department to achieve haemostasis.

haemophilia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Haemophilia B
  presenting_complaint: Routine follow-up for gene therapy clinical trial.
  summary_of_course: 40-year-old male with severe haemophilia B who underwent adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-mediated gene transfer 18 months ago. His Factor IX levels have stabilised at 45%, moving him from the severe to the normal/mild range. He has remained bleed-free without the need for regular prophylaxis since the infusion.

haemophilia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Haemophilia A
  presenting_complaint: Excessive bruising and muscle haematoma after a minor RTA.
  summary_of_course: 45-year-old male presented to the trauma unit with disproportionate bleeding following a low-speed collision. Baseline Factor VIII was 22% with normal von Willebrand factor levels. He was treated with desmopressin (DDAVP) which successfully raised his Factor VIII levels, avoiding the need for plasma-derived products.

haemophilia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Haemophilia A with Septic Arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Hot, swollen, and exquisitely tender left elbow.
  summary_of_course: 31-year-old male with chronic haemophilic arthropathy presented with systemic inflammatory response syndrome and a suspicious joint. Aspiration under Factor VIII cover confirmed Staphylococcus aureus infection. He required intravenous antibiotics and surgical washout alongside increased factor replacement to manage the acute-on-chronic joint pathology.

haemophilia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Haemophilia B
  presenting_complaint: Chest pain and ECG changes suggestive of STEMI.
  summary_of_course: 66-year-old male with severe haemophilia B presented with an acute myocardial infarction. The clinical challenge involved balancing the need for dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and heparin during PCI with his bleeding risk. He was managed with continuous Factor IX infusion to maintain levels >80% during the acute phase, tapering to a higher-trough prophylaxis regimen.

haemophilia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Haemophilia A
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent epistaxis and iron deficiency anaemia.
  summary_of_course: 12-year-old male presented with lethargy and frequent nosebleeds. Laboratory tests showed a Factor VIII level of 18% and low ferritin. He was treated with iron supplementation and a trial of desmopressin nasal spray for use during epistaxis episodes, which significantly improved his quality of life and school attendance.

haemophilia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Haemophilia A
  presenting_complaint: Breakthrough bleeding despite standard prophylaxis.
  summary_of_course: 19-year-old male on thrice-weekly recombinant Factor VIII prophylaxis continued to experience "target joint" bleeds in his right knee. Pharmacokinetic (PK) profiling revealed a short half-life of the standard product. He was switched to an extended half-life (EHL) Factor VIII product, which achieved better trough levels and eliminated breakthrough bleeding.

haemophilia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-partum Acquired Haemophilia A
  presenting_complaint: Severe, persistent vaginal bleeding three weeks after an uncomplicated delivery.
  summary_of_course: 32-year-old female presented with secondary post-partum haemorrhage unresponsive to oxytocics. Investigations revealed a Factor VIII level <1% and a high-titre inhibitor. She was treated with activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) and high-dose steroids, with gradual disappearance of the inhibitor over four months.

haemophilia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate Haemophilia B
  presenting_complaint: Macroscopic haematuria and loin pain.
  summary_of_course: 27-year-old male with Factor IX level of 2% presented with painless haematuria. Imaging ruled out renal calculi or malignancy. The bleed was managed with increased Factor IX replacement and oral tranexamic acid was strictly avoided to prevent the risk of obstructive uropathy from clot formation in the ureter.

haemophilia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Haemophilia A
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset back pain and lower limb weakness.
  summary_of_course: 3-year-old male with severe haemophilia A suffered a minor fall from a chair. Rapidly progressive neurological symptoms prompted an urgent MRI, which revealed a spinal epidural haematoma. Emergency Factor VIII boluses and surgical decompression were performed, preventing permanent paraplegia.

haemophilia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Haemophilia A
  presenting_complaint: Pre-operative assessment for elective cholecystectomy.
  summary_of_course: 58-year-old male with a known Factor VIII level of 35%. Pre-operative planning involved a trial of DDAVP, which showed an inadequate rise in Factor VIII levels. Consequently, he was scheduled for a single dose of Factor VIII concentrate immediately prior to surgery and 48 hours of post-operative coverage to ensure safe haemostasis.
