gastro_oesophageal_reflux_disease_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Gastro-oesophageal Reflux Disease
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent retrosternal burning and acid regurgitation.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male presented to his GP with a 6-month history of post-prandial heartburn, particularly after spicy meals. There were no red-flag symptoms such as dysphagia or weight loss. He was managed in the community with lifestyle modifications and PRN alginates, resulting in complete symptom resolution.

gastro_oesophageal_reflux_disease_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Barrett's Oesophagus
  presenting_complaint: Chronic heartburn and routine surveillance for long-standing reflux.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with a 20-year history of GORD underwent surveillance gastroscopy (OGD). Biopsies confirmed specialised intestinal metaplasia (Barrett's) without dysplasia. He remains on lifelong maintenance proton pump inhibitors (PPI) with five-yearly endoscopic monitoring.

gastro_oesophageal_reflux_disease_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Gastro-oesophageal Reflux (GOR)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent effortless regurgitation and irritability during feeds.
  summary_of_course: A 4-month-old infant presented with frequent vomiting and poor weight gain. Clinical assessment suggested physiological GOR; management included thickened feeds and upright positioning post-feeds. Symptoms improved significantly by age 8 months as the infant began sitting independently.

gastro_oesophageal_reflux_disease_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Benign Peptic Oesophageal Stricture
  presenting_complaint: Progressive dysphagia to solid foods and retrosternal discomfort.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female with poorly controlled GORD reported food sticking in the lower retrosternal area. OGD revealed a circumferential narrowing in the distal oesophagus; histological analysis was negative for malignancy. She underwent successful endoscopic balloon dilatation and was started on high-dose Omeprazole.

gastro_oesophageal_reflux_disease_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Atypical GORD presenting as Adult-Onset Asthma
  presenting_complaint: Chronic nocturnal cough and wheezing.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with no prior respiratory history presented with a persistent night-time cough. Pulmonary function tests showed reversible airway obstruction, but symptoms were refractory to inhaled corticosteroids. A trial of Lansoprazole 30mg BD led to a dramatic reduction in respiratory symptoms, confirming reflux-triggered bronchospasm.

gastro_oesophageal_reflux_disease_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Erosive Oesophagitis (LA Grade D)
  presenting_complaint: Epigastric pain and coffee-ground emesis.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male was admitted to the acute medical unit with haematemesis. Urgent OGD demonstrated extensive longitudinal mucosal breaks involving >75% of the oesophageal circumference (LA Grade D). He was treated with intravenous PPI followed by high-dose oral therapy, with a repeat OGD at 8 weeks showing significant mucosal healing.

gastro_oesophageal_reflux_disease_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Oesophageal Adenocarcinoma secondary to GORD
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss, progressive dysphagia, and iron-deficiency anaemia.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with a history of chronic untreated heartburn presented with a 10kg weight loss over 3 months. OGD identified an exophytic, friable mass in the distal oesophagus; biopsies confirmed adenocarcinoma. He was referred to the multidisciplinary team for staging CT and consideration of neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy.

gastro_oesophageal_reflux_disease_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Functional Heartburn (Edge Case)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent retrosternal burning despite maximal PPI therapy.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female reported daily heartburn that failed to respond to Omeprazole 40mg BD. 24-hour pH-impedance monitoring showed normal acid exposure and no correlation between reflux events and symptoms. She was diagnosed with functional heartburn and successfully managed with low-dose Amitriptyline as a visceral neuromodulator.

gastro_oesophageal_reflux_disease_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Pregnancy-related GORD
  presenting_complaint: Severe retrosternal burning during the third trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant female (32 weeks gestation) experienced debilitating reflux symptoms. Management focused on dietary changes and oral alginates; Ranitidine was avoided due to recent supply issues, and she was briefly started on Omeprazole with good effect. Symptoms resolved spontaneously within 48 hours of delivery.

gastro_oesophageal_reflux_disease_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Large Para-oesophageal Hiatus Hernia
  presenting_complaint: Early satiety, chest pressure, and chronic reflux.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male presented with post-prandial chest discomfort and breathlessness. A barium swallow confirmed a large Type II para-oesophageal hernia with the gastric fundus herniating into the thorax. He underwent elective laparoscopic hiatus hernia repair and Nissen fundoplication, resulting in complete resolution of mechanical and reflux symptoms.

gastro_oesophageal_reflux_disease_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Medication-induced Oesophagitis
  presenting_complaint: Odynophagia and severe retrosternal pain.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with osteoporosis was prescribed Alendronate. She presented with acute-onset painful swallowing after taking the medication with minimal water before lying down. OGD showed discrete "punched-out" ulcers in the mid-oesophagus; the medication was switched to a parenteral bisphosphonate, and symptoms resolved with sucralfate.

gastro_oesophageal_reflux_disease_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Non-cardiac Chest Pain (GORD-related)
  presenting_complaint: Acute crushing chest pain mimicking myocardial infarction.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male was brought to A&E with central chest pain radiating to the jaw. Serial troponins and ECGs were normal, and coronary angiography showed clear vessels. Subsequent OGD revealed distal oesophagitis, and his "angina" was successfully suppressed with high-dose PPI therapy.

gastro_oesophageal_reflux_disease_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory GORD
  presenting_complaint: Persistent acid regurgitation despite BD PPI and H2-receptor antagonists.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male remained symptomatic on Esomeprazole 40mg BD. Oesophageal manometry showed a hypotensive lower oesophageal sphincter, and pH-impedance confirmed persistent weakly acidic reflux. He was referred for a laparoscopic LINX reflux management system (magnetic bead band) after failing medical management.

gastro_oesophageal_reflux_disease_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Sandifer Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Paroxysmal neck twisting and arching of the back in a child.
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old boy with developmental delay presented with episodes of dystonic-like posturing after meals, initially mistaken for seizures. EEG was normal, but 24-hour pH monitoring showed a temporal correlation between acid reflux and the movements. Diagnosis of Sandifer syndrome was made, and symptoms ceased with aggressive antireflux medication.

gastro_oesophageal_reflux_disease_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Scleroderma-associated GORD
  presenting_complaint: Severe dysphagia and nocturnal choking.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female with known Systemic Sclerosis presented with worsening reflux. Manometry showed "scleroderma oesophagus" with absent peristalsis and a wide-open LOS. Due to the high risk of aspiration and stricture formation, she was managed with high-dose PPIs, prokinetics, and strict nocturnal elevation of the head of the bed.

gastro_oesophageal_reflux_disease_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic GORD with Oesophageal Ulceration
  presenting_complaint: Persistent epigastric pain and occult GI bleeding.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male smoker with chronic GORD and heavy NSAID use for osteoarthritis presented with lethargy. Bloods showed a microcytic anaemia (Hb 92 g/L). OGD revealed a deep 2cm ulcer in the distal oesophagus; NSAIDs were discontinued and he was treated with a 12-week course of BD PPI, leading to ulcer healing and Hb recovery.

gastro_oesophageal_reflux_disease_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Aspiration Pneumonia secondary to GORD
  presenting_complaint: Fever, cough, and shortness of breath in a nursing home resident.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with advanced Parkinson's disease and chronic reflux was admitted with right lower lobe pneumonia. Videofluoroscopy demonstrated significant retrograde flow of gastric contents into the pharynx followed by tracheal aspiration. Management included antibiotics and a review of GORD therapy, including the use of a wedge pillow.

gastro_oesophageal_reflux_disease_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (LPR)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic hoarseness, globus sensation, and frequent throat clearing.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female primary school teacher presented with voice changes. ENT laryngoscopy showed interarytenoid erythema and oedema (reflux laryngitis). Unlike typical GORD, she had no heartburn; she responded well to a 3-month course of liquid alginates and PPIs twice daily before meals.

gastro_oesophageal_reflux_disease_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Obesity-related GORD and Obstructive Sleep Apnoea
  presenting_complaint: Severe nocturnal reflux and daytime somnolence.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male (BMI 36) reported waking up gasping with acid in his mouth. Sleep studies confirmed moderate OSA, and OGD showed LA Grade B oesophagitis. A combined approach of CPAP therapy, weight loss via a supervised diet, and PPIs resulted in a 15kg weight loss and resolution of both OSA and GORD.

gastro_oesophageal_reflux_disease_020:
  primary_diagnosis: GORD with Eosinophilic Oesophagitis (EoE) overlap
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent bolus obstruction and heartburn.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male with atopy presented with several episodes of meat bolus impaction. OGD showed linear furrows and "trachealization" of the oesophagus, but also distal erosions. Biopsies confirmed >15 eosinophils per high-power field; he was treated with swallowed fluticasone and PPIs, suggesting a GORD-triggered EoE component.
