third_degree_burn_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Full-thickness thermal burn
  presenting_complaint: Severe pain and charred skin on the right thigh following a house fire.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented with 15% TBSA burns including a large area of leathery, painless, white tissue on the right thigh. Clinical assessment confirmed third-degree burns; he underwent fluid resuscitation via the Parkland formula and early tangential excision. The patient received an autologous split-thickness skin graft (STSG) with 95% take and was discharged after three weeks.

third_degree_burn_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric third-degree scald
  presenting_complaint: Scalding injury to the chest and abdomen from boiling water.
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old female presented acutely with 8% TBSA burns; while most were superficial, a central 3cm area showed waxy white, non-blanching tissue. Diagnosis of a focal third-degree burn was made after 48 hours of observation. She required a small pinch graft under general anaesthetic and recovered well with minimal scarring.

third_degree_burn_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic full-thickness contact burn
  presenting_complaint: Non-healing ulcerated area on the left calf.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with peripheral neuropathy presented with a 4-week-old wound caused by prolonged contact with an electric heater. Examination revealed a 5cm dry, black eschar consistent with a neglected third-degree burn. Management involved surgical debridement of necrotic tissue followed by vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy and eventual delayed primary closure.

third_degree_burn_004:
  primary_diagnosis: High-voltage electrical burn
  presenting_complaint: Entry and exit wounds following an industrial electrical accident.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old electrician presented with a small but deep charred entry wound on the right hand and an explosive exit wound on the left foot. Both sites were classified as third-degree burns with underlying muscle necrosis and associated myoglobinuria. He required urgent fasciotomies, multiple debridements, and intensive care monitoring for acute kidney injury.

third_degree_burn_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Chemical third-degree burn
  presenting_complaint: Deep tissue destruction on the forearm after sulphuric acid exposure.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old laboratory technician presented with a "melted" appearance to the skin of the left forearm. The acid caused immediate liquefactive necrosis and deep protein coagulation, resulting in a full-thickness injury. Despite immediate irrigation, the area required formal excision and a thick STSG due to the depth of the chemical insult.

third_degree_burn_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Infected third-degree burn with sepsis
  presenting_complaint: Fever, confusion, and purulent discharge from an existing burn site.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with a 20% TBSA third-degree burn presented 10 days post-injury with systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Wound swabs grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the burn margins showed invasive infection. He was treated with intravenous ceftazidime, aggressive surgical debridement of the infected eschar, and intensive care support.

third_degree_burn_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Circumferential full-thickness burn
  presenting_complaint: Numbness and loss of pulses in the right arm following a flash burn.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male sustained a circumferential third-degree burn to the upper limb during a petrol explosion. Rapid development of oedema led to compartment syndrome symptoms; an emergency bedside escharotomy was performed to restore distal perfusion. Once stabilised, he underwent definitive grafting of the full-thickness defects.

third_degree_burn_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Focal third-degree grease burn
  presenting_complaint: Deep, painless white wound on the dorsal aspect of the hand.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old chef presented after hot deep-fat fryer oil spilled onto her hand. The wound was insensate and lacked capillary refill, confirming a third-degree injury despite its small size (1% TBSA). Due to the involvement of the extensor tendons, she underwent specialised hand surgery involving a local flap rather than a simple skin graft.

third_degree_burn_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Full-thickness burn with inhalation injury
  presenting_complaint: Extensive body burns and respiratory distress after a flat fire.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old smoker presented with 40% TBSA burns, including third-degree injuries to the face and neck, and soot in the oropharynx. He was immediately intubated for airway protection; bronchoscopy confirmed grade 2 inhalation injury. Management focused on ventilatory support and staged excision of the full-thickness facial burns to prevent ectropion.

third_degree_burn_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic neurotrophic third-degree burn
  presenting_complaint: Painless black patch on the sole of the foot.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes used a hot water bottle for cold feet, unaware of the temperature. He presented a week later with a 4cm area of full-thickness necrosis (third-degree burn) on the plantar surface. Due to poor vascularity and underlying osteomyelitis risk, he required a partial ray amputation.

third_degree_burn_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute third-degree burn
  presenting_complaint: Persistent raw area 3 weeks after a kitchen scald.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old female initially treated a burn as partial-thickness in the community, but the wound failed to re-epithelialise. Specialist review identified a central zone of third-degree depth that had been masked by superficial slough. She was scheduled for elective excision and grafting, which successfully closed the wound within 14 days.

third_degree_burn_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening major third-degree burns
  presenting_complaint: 85% TBSA burns following a vehicular explosion.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male arrived in extremis with near-total body full-thickness burns. Despite aggressive fluid resuscitation and multiple escharotomies, his prognosis was deemed terminal due to the extent of third-degree injury and multi-organ failure. Management was transitioned to palliative care after multidisciplinary review and family consultation.

third_degree_burn_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Alkali third-degree burn
  presenting_complaint: Deep ulceration on both knees after kneeling in wet cement.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old builder presented with delayed-onset pain and deep skin loss on his knees. The alkaline nature of the cement caused "silent" deep tissue destruction, resulting in bilateral third-degree burns. He required tangential excision down to the pre-patellar bursa and application of an artificial dermal substitute before final skin grafting.

third_degree_burn_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Self-inflicted third-degree burns
  presenting_complaint: Multiple deep circular burns on the forearms.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female with a history of borderline personality disorder presented with several 1cm diameter, full-thickness cigarette burns. The injuries were deep, reaching the subcutaneous fat, and were classified as third-degree. Treatment involved conservative silver-impregnated dressings and urgent psychiatric liaison for risk management.

third_degree_burn_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Non-accidental third-degree burn
  presenting_complaint: Symmetrical "glove" distribution burns on a child's hands.
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old boy was brought to A&E with deep, waxy white burns on both hands up to the wrists. The clear demarcation and lack of splash marks suggested forced immersion, and clinical signs confirmed third-degree depth. A safeguarding protocol was initiated alongside surgical management of the burns, which required bilateral grafting.

third_degree_burn_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-burn contracture (chronic third-degree)
  presenting_complaint: Restricted movement of the axilla following an old burn.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male presented with a severe contracture six months after a third-degree burn that had been allowed to heal by secondary intention. The dense scar tissue prevented him from abducting his arm beyond 45 degrees. He underwent a release of the contracture and a large Z-plasty to restore functional range of motion.

third_degree_burn_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic infected burn scar
  presenting_complaint: New ulceration and bleeding within an old third-degree burn scar.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female with a childhood third-degree burn scar on her leg presented with a non-healing, friable ulcer within the scar tissue. Biopsy was performed to rule out Marjolin's ulcer (squamous cell carcinoma), but results showed chronic staphylococcal infection. She was treated with targeted antibiotics and surgical revision of the unstable scar tissue.

third_degree_burn_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Lightning-induced third-degree burn
  presenting_complaint: Focal deep burns on the feet and transient paralysis.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old hiker was struck by lightning; while most skin showed superficial Lichtenberg figures, the exit points on his heels were full-thickness (third-degree) burns. Cardiac monitoring was normal, but the heel wounds required debridement. The depth of the burns necessitated a local rotational flap for coverage due to the weight-bearing location.

third_degree_burn_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Deep contact burn with muscle involvement
  presenting_complaint: Large area of charred skin on the back after a fall.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female was found on the floor after a syncopal episode, having rested against a hot radiator for several hours. She sustained a 10cm third-degree burn that extended through the dermis into the paraspinal muscles. Management required extensive debridement of necrotic muscle and a complex reconstructive procedure involving a latissimus dorsi flap.

third_degree_burn_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Industrial radiofrequency third-degree burn
  presenting_complaint: Deep, localised tissue damage on the thigh without external heat.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old technician was exposed to high-power radiofrequency radiation, causing internal heating and a delayed-onset third-degree burn. The skin became necrotic and leathery over 48 hours despite no initial redness. Surgical exploration revealed deep tissue coagulation, requiring wide excision and a thick STSG to achieve closure.
