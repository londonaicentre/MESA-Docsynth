  primary_diagnosis: Depressive pseudodementia
  presenting_complaint: Significant memory loss and cognitive decline in an elderly patient.
  summary_of_course: An 84-year-old female was brought to the memory clinic by her daughter for suspected Alzheimer's disease. Cognitive testing (MMSE 21/30) showed "don't know" answers rather than near-misses, and her mood was profoundly low. Following a trial of Sertraline, her cognitive scores returned to 28/30, confirming that her cognitive impairment was secondary to severe depression.
