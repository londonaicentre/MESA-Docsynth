ventricular_fibrillation_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with Ventricular Fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Sudden collapse following central chest pain.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male collapsed in a public shopping centre after complaining of severe retrosternal heaviness. Bystander CPR was initiated and an AED delivered two shocks for ventricular fibrillation, achieving ROSC before ambulance arrival. He underwent urgent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) to a blocked left anterior descending artery and was discharged with an unremarkable neurological recovery.

ventricular_fibrillation_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-operative Ventricular Fibrillation secondary to hypokalaemia
  presenting_complaint: Sudden cardiac arrest on the surgical ward.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female, three days post-total hip replacement, suffered a sudden cardiac arrest. The cardiac arrest team identified ventricular fibrillation on the monitor, which was successfully terminated with a single 200J biphasic shock. Investigations revealed a serum potassium of 2.8 mmol/L, likely due to aggressive diuresis, which was corrected alongside magnesium supplementation.

He was successfully defibrillated on the scene and had no underlying structural heart disease on subsequent echocardiography or MRI.

ventricular_fibrillation_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Accidental Hypothermia with Ventricular Fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Profoundly cold and unresponsive.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male was found outdoors in winter with a core temperature of 26°C. During transfer to the hospital, he developed ventricular fibrillation; per protocol, shocks were limited until his temperature reached 30°C. He was managed with active internal rewarming and prolonged CPR, eventually achieving ROSC once his temperature hit 32°C.

ventricular_fibrillation_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Brugada Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Nocturnal agonal gasping and unresponsiveness.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male was found gasping in bed by his partner, who commenced CPR. Paramedics found him in ventricular fibrillation and restored sinus rhythm after one shock. His baseline ECG showed coved ST-segment elevation in V1-V2 (Type 1 Brugada pattern), and he subsequently received an ICD for secondary prevention.

ventricular_fibrillation_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome with pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation leading to VF
  presenting_complaint: Rapid palpitations followed by collapse.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male with known WPW presented with a very rapid, irregular wide-complex tachycardia. While being prepared for cardioversion, the rhythm degenerated into ventricular fibrillation due to rapid conduction over the accessory pathway. He was successfully shocked into sinus rhythm and underwent urgent radiofrequency ablation of the Bundle of Kent.

ventricular_fibrillation_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Late Post-Infarction Ventricular Fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Sudden collapse on the Coronary Care Unit (CCU).
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female, three days post-STEMI and successfully reperfused, suddenly developed ventricular fibrillation while resting. She was immediately defibrillated by the nursing staff with 200J. Repeat angiography showed no new occlusion or stent thrombosis, suggesting the arrest was due to myocardial irritability in the infarct border zone.

ventricular_fibrillation_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Septic Shock with terminal Ventricular Fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Hypotension, fever, and declining consciousness.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male was admitted with urosepsis and multi-organ failure. Despite maximal vasopressor support and antibiotics, he became increasingly acidotic (pH 7.05) and hyperkalaemic. He eventually developed ventricular fibrillation which was refractory to multiple shocks and advanced life support, resulting in his death.

ventricular_fibrillation_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Hyperkalaemia-induced Ventricular Fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Generalised weakness and missed dialysis sessions.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female with ESRD presented having missed three sessions of haemodialysis. Her ECG initially showed peaked T-waves and a widened QRS, which rapidly progressed to a "sine-wave" pattern and then ventricular fibrillation. She received calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose, and multiple shocks, eventually stabilising enough for emergency dialysis.

ventricular_fibrillation_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Peripartum Cardiomyopathy with Ventricular Fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Sudden breathlessness and arrest 2 weeks postpartum.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female, two weeks after an uncomplicated delivery, collapsed at home. Paramedics found her in ventricular fibrillation and achieved ROSC after three shocks. Echocardiography revealed a severely dilated left ventricle with an EF of 15%, confirming peripartum cardiomyopathy, and she was started on heart failure therapy and a wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (LifeVest).

  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic Ventricular Fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Sudden cardiac arrest during a football match.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old elite athlete suffered a cardiac arrest on the pitch and was resuscitated from ventricular fibrillation. Extensive investigations including coronary angiography, cardiac MRI, flecainide provocation, and genetic screening were all normal. He was diagnosed with idiopathic VF and underwent ICD implantation for secondary prevention.

ventricular_fibrillation_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Ventricular Fibrillation (E-CPR candidate)
  presenting_complaint: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with ongoing VF.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male had a witnessed arrest and remained in ventricular fibrillation despite 10 shocks and 300mg amiodarone. He was transported to a tertiary centre with mechanical CPR (LUCAS) for Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) initiation. After 60 minutes of total downtime, ROSC was achieved on VA-ECMO, and he eventually made a significant neurological recovery.

ventricular_fibrillation_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Cardiac Sarcoidosis with Ventricular Fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent palpitations and light-headedness.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with known pulmonary sarcoidosis was admitted for investigation of syncope. While on a 24-hour Holter monitor, she experienced a run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia that degenerated into ventricular fibrillation. She was successfully resuscitated by the hospital crash team and subsequent cardiac MRI showed late gadolinium enhancement consistent with myocardial sarcoid involvement.

ventricular_fibrillation_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Anaphylaxis-induced Ventricular Fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Hypotension and bronchospasm during anaesthetic induction.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old female underwent induction of general anaesthesia for an elective cholecystectomy. Following administration of atracurium, she developed profound bronchospasm and cardiovascular collapse, progressing to ventricular fibrillation. She was resuscitated with adrenaline and shocks, and subsequent tryptase levels confirmed a severe anaphylactic reaction.
