epilepsy_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Convulsive Status Epilepticus
  presenting_complaint: Continuous generalised tonic-clonic seizures
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with known focal epilepsy was brought to A&E via ambulance in active convulsions lasting 40 minutes. Despite intravenous lorazepam and a phenytoin bolus, seizures persisted, requiring intubation and sedation with propofol in the ICU. He was eventually stabilised on levetiracetam and lacosamide.

epilepsy_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-stroke Epilepsy
  presenting_complaint: Focal twitching of the right arm and face
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with a history of a left-sided ischaemic stroke two years ago presented with recurrent rhythmic jerking of her right side. CT head showed an old area of encephalomalacia in the left motor cortex. She was started on low-dose lamotrigine, which successfully controlled the focal aware seizures.

epilepsy_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy
  presenting_complaint: Morning limb jerking and a single generalised seizure
  summary_of_course: A 17-year-old male reported "shaking fits" in his arms shortly after waking, particularly when sleep-deprived. After a first-time generalised tonic-clonic seizure following a party, an EEG confirmed polyspike-and-wave discharges. He was commenced on sodium valproate with excellent clinical response.

epilepsy_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Temporal Lobe Epilepsy with Hippocampal Sclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Rising epigastric sensation and lip-smacking
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old female described frequent "auras" of déjà vu followed by impaired awareness and oral automatisms. MRI brain revealed right-sided hippocampal sclerosis and atrophy. She was diagnosed with focal impaired awareness seizures and started on carbamazepine, with a referral to the epilepsy surgery multidisciplinary team.

epilepsy_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Dravet Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Prolonged febrile and afebrile seizures in infancy
  summary_of_course: A 2-year-old boy with a history of hemiclonic seizures triggered by fever was found to have an SCN1A gene mutation. Despite multiple anti-epileptic drugs, he experienced frequent seizures and developmental delay. Management currently involves a combination of stiripentol, clobazam, and a ketogenic diet.

epilepsy_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcohol Withdrawal Seizures
  presenting_complaint: Two generalised tonic-clonic seizures following cessation of drinking
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with chronic alcohol dependency presented to the emergency department 48 hours after his last drink. He suffered two self-limiting GTC seizures in the clinical area. He was managed with a reducing dose of chlordiazepoxide and thiamine supplementation; long-term AEDs were not indicated.

epilepsy_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Frontal Lobe Epilepsy
  presenting_complaint: Explosive nocturnal movements and thrashing
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old male was referred for "night terrors" involving complex, hypermotor movements during sleep. Video-telemetry captured brief nocturnal seizures with asymmetric tonic posturing. He was started on topiramate, which significantly reduced the frequency of these nocturnal events.

epilepsy_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Eclampsia-related Seizures
  presenting_complaint: New-onset seizure in the third trimester of pregnancy
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female at 34 weeks gestation presented with hypertension, proteinuria, and a sudden generalised seizure. She was treated with a loading dose and maintenance infusion of magnesium sulphate. Following an emergency caesarean section, her seizures ceased, and she remained seizure-free postpartum.

epilepsy_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Multiple seizure types including drop attacks
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old girl with significant cognitive impairment presented with tonic, atonic, and atypical absence seizures. EEG showed a slow spike-wave pattern (<2.5 Hz). Her refractory epilepsy required polytherapy with rufinamide and sodium valproate, alongside a vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) implant.

epilepsy_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Focal Epilepsy
  presenting_complaint: Persistent focal seizures despite multiple medications
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female with focal epilepsy failed to achieve seizure freedom on four different AEDs, including levetiracetam and brivaracetam. She underwent a VNS insertion to reduce seizure burden and severity. While not seizure-free, her recovery time and hospital admissions for clusters have significantly decreased.

epilepsy_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-traumatic Epilepsy
  presenting_complaint: Late-onset seizures following traumatic brain injury
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male who sustained a severe traumatic brain injury in a road traffic accident three years ago presented with a first generalised seizure. MRI showed significant cortical scarring in the frontal lobes. He was successfully stabilised on levetiracetam monotherapy.

epilepsy_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic Generalised Epilepsy
  presenting_complaint: Single unprovoked generalised tonic-clonic seizure
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old university student presented after a witnessed GTC seizure during an exam period. Clinical examination and CT head were unremarkable, but a sleep-deprived EEG showed generalised spike-wave paroxysms. Given the high risk of recurrence, she was started on lamotrigine after a detailed discussion regarding pregnancy risks.

epilepsy_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Epilepsia Partialis Continua
  presenting_complaint: Continuous rhythmic twitching of the right hand
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with a known cortical dysplasia presented with focal motor seizures involving the right hand that persisted for several days. This rare form of focal status epilepticus was resistant to initial benzodiazepines. He required intensive monitoring and high-dose levetiracetam to achieve seizure control.

epilepsy_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Benign Rolandic Epilepsy
  presenting_complaint: Nocturnal facial twitching and speech arrest
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old boy experienced occasional episodes at night where he would wake up unable to speak with twitching on one side of his face. EEG showed centrotemporal spikes. As the episodes were infrequent and the condition is typically self-limiting by puberty, a "watch and wait" approach was adopted without medication.

epilepsy_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Autoimmune Encephalitis-related Seizures
  presenting_complaint: New-onset seizures, confusion, and memory loss
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female presented with subacute cognitive decline and frequent focal seizures. CSF analysis and serum testing confirmed anti-LGI1 antibodies. She was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone and plasma exchange, leading to a marked reduction in seizure frequency and cognitive improvement.

epilepsy_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Brain Tumour-related Epilepsy
  presenting_complaint: New-onset focal seizures with secondary generalisation
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male presented with a first-time seizure preceded by a strange smell (olfactory hallucination). MRI brain revealed a low-grade glioma in the left temporal lobe. Seizure control was prioritised with lacosamide while he awaited neurosurgical resection and further oncological management.

epilepsy_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Refractory Epilepsy with SUDEP Risk
  presenting_complaint: Uncontrolled nocturnal tonic-clonic seizures
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male with long-standing epilepsy continued to have 3-4 GTC seizures per month despite triple therapy. Due to the high risk of Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP), he was provided with a nocturnal seizure monitor and safety counselling. He is currently being evaluated for deep brain stimulation (DBS).

epilepsy_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Drug-induced Seizures
  presenting_complaint: Generalised seizure following tramadol overdose
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female was brought to A&E after a single GTC seizure following the ingestion of 1500mg of tramadol. Metabolic and infectious screens were negative, and the EEG was normal. She was monitored for 24 hours and discharged with mental health follow-up, with no requirement for long-term epilepsy treatment.

epilepsy_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Co-existing Epilepsy and Dissociative Seizures
  presenting_complaint: Frequent "blackouts" with variable semiology
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female with childhood-onset epilepsy reported a change in her seizure pattern, now featuring prolonged episodes of thrashing and eye closure. Video-EEG telemetry confirmed both genuine epileptic seizures and dissociative (non-epileptic) attacks. Management required a combined approach involving neurology and specialist psychotherapy.
