chronic_pancreatitis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic calcific pancreatitis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent epigastric pain and steatorrhoea
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with a 20-year history of heavy alcohol consumption presented with chronic mid-epigastric pain radiating to the back and oily, foul-smelling stools. CT abdomen revealed diffuse pancreatic calcifications and ductal dilatation. He was started on high-dose pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) and referred to the alcohol liaison team, showing moderate improvement in nutritional status.

chronic_pancreatitis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Hereditary pancreatitis (PRSS1 mutation)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent bouts of severe abdominal pain
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old female with a strong family history of pancreatic disease presented with her fourth episode of acute-on-chronic pancreatitis. Genetic testing confirmed a PRSS1 mutation, and MRCP showed early structural changes consistent with chronic inflammation. Management focuses on pain control, hydration, and long-term surveillance for pancreatic adenocarcinoma due to the significantly increased lifetime risk.

chronic_pancreatitis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 1 Autoimmune Pancreatitis (AIP)
  presenting_complaint: Obstructive jaundice and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male presented with painless jaundice and a "sausage-shaped" pancreas on CT. Serum IgG4 levels were significantly elevated (4.2 g/L), and biopsy confirmed lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis. He responded dramatically to a tapering course of oral prednisolone, with resolution of the biliary stricture and normalisation of liver function tests.

chronic_pancreatitis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic pancreatitis with pancreatic pseudocyst
  presenting_complaint: Early satiety and worsening upper abdominal fullness
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female with known chronic pancreatitis presented with new-onset bloating and a palpable epigastric mass. Imaging identified an 8cm pseudocyst in the pancreatic tail compressing the stomach. Following failed conservative management, she underwent successful endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided cystogastrostomy with stent placement.

chronic_pancreatitis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Tropical pancreatitis
  presenting_complaint: Epigastric pain and new-onset diabetes
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male recently arrived from Southern India presented with chronic abdominal pain and polyuria. Investigations revealed large "star-shaped" intraductal calculi and a HbA1c of 84 mmol/mol. He was diagnosed with tropical pancreatitis, requiring insulin therapy for Type 3c diabetes and PERT for exocrine insufficiency.

chronic_pancreatitis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Groove pancreatitis
  presenting_complaint: Refractory vomiting and post-prandial pain
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male smoker presented with features of gastric outlet obstruction. MRI showed inflammatory changes localised to the "groove" between the pancreatic head, duodenum, and common bile duct. Despite conservative management with proton pump inhibitors and nutritional support, he eventually required a Whipple’s procedure (pancreatoduodenectomy) due to persistent duodenal stenosis.

chronic_pancreatitis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic pancreatitis with splenic vein thrombosis
  presenting_complaint: Haematemesis and melaena
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with long-standing alcohol-related chronic pancreatitis presented with an acute upper gastrointestinal bleed. Endoscopy revealed isolated gastric varices, and a CT angiogram confirmed splenic vein thrombosis secondary to chronic peripancreatic inflammation. He was managed with emergency sclerotherapy and is being considered for a splenectomy to prevent recurrent haemorrhage.

chronic_pancreatitis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Minimal change chronic pancreatitis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic unexplained abdominal pain
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female presented with a 2-year history of debilitating epigastric pain despite normal CT and MRCP imaging. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was performed, meeting 5 Rosemont criteria including hyperechoic foci and lobularity. She was diagnosed with minimal change chronic pancreatitis and commenced on a multidisciplinary pain management programme involving coeliac plexus neurolysis.

chronic_pancreatitis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic pancreatitis with pancreatic ascites
  presenting_complaint: Increasing abdominal girth and shortness of breath
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male with a history of acute-on-chronic pancreatitis presented with tense ascites. Paracentesis revealed an ascitic fluid amylase level of >10,000 U/L, suggesting a pancreatico-peritoneal fistula. Following failed conservative management with octreotide and parenteral nutrition, ERCP identified a ductal leak in the body of the pancreas which was successfully bridged with a plastic stent.

chronic_pancreatitis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Pancreas divisum with chronic obstructive pancreatitis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent post-prandial epigastric pain
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female with recurrent idiopathic pancreatitis was found to have pancreas divisum on MRCP. The dorsal duct appeared dilated with minor papilla stenosis, suggesting chronic obstructive changes. She underwent minor papilla sphincterotomy and stenting, resulting in a significant reduction in the frequency and severity of her pain episodes.

chronic_pancreatitis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic senile chronic pancreatitis
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic (incidental finding)
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male underwent a CT scan for suspected diverticulitis, which incidentally showed diffuse pancreatic atrophy and ductal calcifications. He denied any history of abdominal pain, alcohol excess, or change in bowel habits. Faecal elastase was slightly low (150 µg/g), and he was managed conservatively with nutritional monitoring, as he remained asymptomatic and weight-stable.

chronic_pancreatitis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic pancreatitis with Type 3c Diabetes Mellitus
  presenting_complaint: Poorly controlled blood sugars and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with a 10-year history of chronic pancreatitis presented with lethargy and a HbA1c of 98 mmol/mol. He was diagnosed with pancreatogenic (Type 3c) diabetes, characterised by the loss of both insulin and glucagon-producing cells. He was started on a basal-bolus insulin regimen but remains at high risk for "brittle" hypoglycaemic episodes.

chronic_pancreatitis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-traumatic chronic pancreatitis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent left upper quadrant pain
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male who suffered blunt abdominal trauma in a road traffic accident three years ago presented with chronic pain. Previous imaging had shown a grade III pancreatic tail injury managed conservatively. Current MRCP shows a localized stricture in the tail with upstream ductal dilatation and parenchymal scarring, necessitating a distal pancreatectomy for symptom relief.

chronic_pancreatitis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic pancreatitis with common bile duct stricture
  presenting_complaint: Pruritus and dark urine
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female with known chronic pancreatitis presented with cholestatic liver enzymes (ALP 450 U/L, Bilirubin 55 µmol/L). Imaging confirmed a long, smooth stricture of the intrapancreatic portion of the common bile duct (CBD) due to extrinsic compression from fibrotic pancreatic tissue. She underwent ERCP with placement of multiple side-by-side plastic stents to gradually dilate the stricture.

chronic_pancreatitis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypertriglyceridaemia-induced chronic pancreatitis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent abdominal pain and eruptive xanthomas
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male with familial hypercholesterolaemia presented with recurrent epigastric pain; his serum triglycerides were found to be 22 mmol/L. Recurrent bouts of acute hypertriglyceridaemic pancreatitis have led to permanent structural damage and exocrine insufficiency. Management involves a very low-fat diet, fibrates, and PERT, with plasmapheresis reserved for acute flares.

chronic_pancreatitis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Cystic Fibrosis-related chronic pancreatitis
  presenting_complaint: Failure to thrive and malabsorptive diarrhoea
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old child with Cystic Fibrosis (DeltaF508 homozygous) presented with poor weight gain despite high caloric intake. Faecal elastase was undetectable (<15 µg/g), and ultrasound showed a small, fatty, hyperechoic pancreas. He was started on a comprehensive regimen of Creon, fat-soluble vitamin supplementation (A, D, E, K), and high-calorie nutritional drinks.

chronic_pancreatitis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 2 Autoimmune Pancreatitis (AIP)
  presenting_complaint: Acute abdominal pain and history of Ulcerative Colitis
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female with known Ulcerative Colitis presented with symptoms of acute pancreatitis. Unlike Type 1, her IgG4 levels were normal, but EUS-guided biopsy showed granulocytic epithelial lesions (GELs). She was diagnosed with Type 2 AIP and responded well to corticosteroids, with no recurrence of pancreatic symptoms following a slow taper.

chronic_pancreatitis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic pancreatitis with pancreatico-pleural effusion
  presenting_complaint: Progressive dyspnoea and cough
  summary_of_course: A 47-year-old male with alcohol-related chronic pancreatitis presented with a large left-sided pleural effusion. Thoracocentesis revealed an exudative fluid with an amylase level of 15,000 U/L. CT confirmed a fistula tract from the pancreatic duct through the diaphragm into the pleural space, which required ERCP-guided stenting and prolonged chest drain insertion.

chronic_pancreatitis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic pancreatitis with duodenal dystrophy
  presenting_complaint: Severe post-prandial pain and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old male smoker presented with cachexia and "fear of food". Imaging showed multiple cysts within a thickened duodenal wall and associated chronic inflammatory changes in the pancreatic head. After failing medical management and EUS-guided drainage of the duodenal cysts, he underwent a successful pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy.

chronic_pancreatitis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: End-stage chronic pancreatitis
  presenting_complaint: Refractory pain and opioid dependence
  summary_of_course: A 51-year-old female with a 15-year history of idiopathic chronic pancreatitis presented with "burn-out" symptoms, including total exocrine and endocrine failure. Despite multiple endoscopic interventions and coeliac plexus blocks, her pain remained refractory, requiring high-dose fentanyl patches. She is currently being evaluated for a Total Pancreatectomy with Islet Autotransplantation (TPIAT) as a last-resort measure.
