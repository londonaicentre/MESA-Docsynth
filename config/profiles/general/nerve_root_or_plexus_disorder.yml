nerve_root_or_plexus_disorder_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Thoracic Radiculopathy (T10)
  presenting_complaint: Band-like abdominal pain and "bulging" of the abdominal wall.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented with localized burning pain around his midriff. Examination revealed a focal protrusion of the abdominal wall (pseudohernia) due to denervation of the rectus abdominis. MRI of the thoracic spine identified a T10/T11 disc herniation, which was managed conservatively after excluding intra-abdominal pathology.

nerve_root_or_plexus_disorder_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic Lumbar Radiculopathy
  presenting_complaint: Sudden foot drop following a minor fall in a patient with known spinal stenosis.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with long-standing neurogenic claudication developed acute L4/L5 weakness. Clinical assessment showed 1/5 power in ankle dorsiflexion. Due to her comorbidities (atrial fibrillation, heart failure), she was managed with high-dose steroids and a foot-drop splint rather than aggressive spinal decompression.

nerve_root_or_plexus_disorder_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Cervical Spondylotic Myeloradiculopathy
  presenting_complaint: Clumsy hands, gait instability, and shooting pains in both arms.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male reported difficulty fastening buttons and frequent trips. Examination showed a combination of lower motor neuron signs in the arms (wasting) and upper motor neuron signs in the legs (hyperreflexia, Babinski positive). MRI showed multi-level cord compression and root entrapment, necessitating urgent posterior cervical decompression and fusion.

nerve_root_or_plexus_disorder_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic Lumbosacral Plexitis
  presenting_complaint: Subacute onset of severe pelvic and hip pain followed by leg weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female with no prior medical history developed non-traumatic, progressive weakness of the right leg over two weeks. CSF analysis showed albuminocytologic dissociation, and MRI showed enhancement of the lumbosacral plexus. She was treated with Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) for suspected autoimmune plexitis, resulting in gradual motor improvement over six months.

nerve_root_or_plexus_disorder_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-Surgical Brachial Plexopathy (Positioning Injury)
  presenting_complaint: Numbness and weakness in the bilateral hands following cardiac surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male underwent a prolonged coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). Post-operatively, he complained of bilateral ulnar distribution sensory loss and weak grip, attributed to sternal retraction and arm positioning during the 6-hour procedure. Nerve conduction studies confirmed a lower trunk plexopathy; symptoms resolved spontaneously after four months of hand therapy.

nerve_root_or_plexus_disorder_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Neurogenic Thoracic Outlet Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Wasting of the hand muscles and pain in the medial forearm.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female swimmer presented with progressive atrophy of the thenar and hypothenar eminences. X-ray revealed bilateral cervical ribs. Nerve conduction studies confirmed a Gilliatt-Sumner hand (T1 distribution loss), and she underwent surgical resection of the right cervical rib and fibrous band to prevent further axonal loss.

nerve_root_or_plexus_disorder_016:
  primary_diagnosis: L5 Radiculopathy mimicking Peroneal Palsy
  presenting_complaint: Foot drop and numbness on the outer leg.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male was initially diagnosed with a common peroneal nerve palsy at the fibular head. However, weakness in hip abduction (gluteus medius) suggested a more proximal L5 root lesion. MRI Lumbar spine confirmed a sequestered disc fragment in the lateral recess, and the patient was redirected to spinal surgery for discectomy.

nerve_root_or_plexus_disorder_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Multi-level Lumbar Foraminal Stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral leg aching and paraesthesia worsened by standing.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with severe osteoarthritis presented with chronic "heavy legs." Imaging showed Grade 3 foraminal stenosis at L3/L4 and L4/L5. Given his age and preference, he was managed in the community with a combination of gabapentin, hydrotherapy, and weight management, achieving stable symptom control.

nerve_root_or_plexus_disorder_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Lumbosacral Plexopathy secondary to Retroperitoneal Haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of severe groin pain and inability to flex the hip in ICU.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male on therapeutic anticoagulation for a PE developed sudden hypotension and right-sided leg weakness. CT abdomen revealed a large psoas haematoma compressing the lumbosacral plexus. Anticoagulation was reversed, and he was managed conservatively with bed rest; however, he was left with permanent femoral nerve distribution deficits.

nerve_root_or_plexus_disorder_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-operative C5 Nerve Root Palsy
  presenting_complaint: Inability to abduct the shoulder immediately following cervical laminectomy.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male underwent successful multi-level decompression for myelopathy. On day 1 post-op, he developed a new, isolated Grade 0/5 weakness of the right deltoid and biceps. This was diagnosed as a "tethering" C5 palsy; he was managed with aggressive physiotherapy and regained full power within nine months.

nerve_root_or_plexus_disorder_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Hereditary Neuralgic Amyotrophy
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of severe arm pain and weakness since childhood.
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old boy presented with his third episode of unilateral shoulder girdle wasting. Family history revealed his mother and maternal grandfather had similar "attacks." Genetic testing confirmed a mutation in the SEPT9 gene, and he was started on a management plan involving early corticosteroid use at the onset of pain to reduce the severity of subsequent plexopathy.
