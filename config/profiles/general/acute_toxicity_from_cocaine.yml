  primary_diagnosis: Cocaine-induced haemorrhagic stroke
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset dense left-sided weakness and reduced GCS.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with pre-existing hypertension presented after smoking crack cocaine. CT head demonstrated a large right-sided intracerebral haemorrhage with midline shift. Despite aggressive blood pressure management and neurosurgical consultation, the patient's condition deteriorated, and he was transitioned to palliative care.

  primary_diagnosis: Cocaine-induced rhabdomyolysis and AKI
  presenting_complaint: Severe muscle pain and tea-coloured urine.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male presented following a 48-hour cocaine binge. Laboratory tests showed a CK of 85,000 U/L and a creatinine of 340 µmol/L, indicating acute kidney injury.

acute_toxicity_from_cocaine_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Cocaine-induced placental abruption
  presenting_complaint: Acute abdominal pain and heavy vaginal bleeding at 32 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old pregnant female presented to the obstetric unit after recent cocaine use. Ultrasound confirmed a large retroplacental haematoma and foetal distress. An emergency Caesarean section was performed; the neonate required resuscitation and admission to the NICU for prematurity and potential withdrawal.

  primary_diagnosis: Cocaine-induced excited delirium syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Extreme agitation, hyperthermia, and bizarre behaviour.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male was brought in by police after behaving erratically in public. He was found to have a core temperature of 40.8°C and profound metabolic acidosis. He was managed with aggressive cooling, high-dose benzodiazepines, and intubation for neuroprotection in the ICU.

  primary_diagnosis: Acute cocaine-induced psychosis
  presenting_complaint: Paranoid delusions and auditory hallucinations.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female with no prior psychiatric history presented claiming she was being followed by drones. Toxicology was positive for cocaine and cannabis. Her symptoms resolved within 36 hours of abstinence and short-term use of haloperidol, confirming a substance-induced psychotic disorder.

acute_toxicity_from_cocaine_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Cocaine-induced coronary vasospasm (Prinzmetal angina)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of transient chest pain at rest.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male presented with intermittent chest pain following cocaine use. Serial ECGs showed transient ST-segment depression during pain which resolved spontaneously. He was treated with nitrates and calcium channel blockers, and advised that further cocaine use could lead to permanent myocardial damage.

acute_toxicity_from_cocaine_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Cocaine-induced Type A aortic dissection
  presenting_complaint: Sudden "tearing" chest pain radiating to the back.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male presented with hypertensive urgency (210/115 mmHg) after cocaine use. CT aortogram revealed an ascending aortic dissection extending to the arch. He underwent emergency cardiothoracic surgery for aortic graft replacement and survived with a prolonged recovery period.

acute_toxicity_from_cocaine_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic cocaine cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Progressive dyspnoea, orthopnoea, and bilateral leg swelling.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old long-term cocaine user presented with acute decompensated heart failure. Echocardiography showed a dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 20%. He was treated with IV furosemide and ACE inhibitors, and counselled on the necessity of total abstinence to allow for potential myocardial recovery.

acute_toxicity_from_cocaine_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Mixed drug toxicity (Cocaine and Heroin)
  presenting_complaint: Found unresponsive with pinpoint pupils and bradypnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male "speedball" user was brought to the ED. While the heroin caused respiratory depression (reversed by naloxone), the cocaine component caused subsequent agitation and tachycardia. He required careful titration of benzodiazepines to manage the stimulant effects once the opioid antagonist took effect.

acute_toxicity_from_cocaine_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Levamisole-induced vasculopathy (cocaine contaminant)
  presenting_complaint: Painful, purpuric skin lesions on the ears and cheeks.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female user of "street" cocaine presented with retiform purpura and skin necrosis. Blood tests revealed severe neutropaenia (0.8 x 10^9/L) and positive ANCA. The diagnosis of levamisole-induced vasculopathy was made, requiring wound care and strict avoidance of contaminated cocaine.

acute_toxicity_from_cocaine_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Cocaine-induced status epilepticus
  presenting_complaint: Continuous tonic-clonic seizures lasting over 20 minutes.
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old male presented in status epilepticus following heavy cocaine use. First-line treatment with lorazepam failed, necessitating a phenytoin loading dose and eventually propofol anaesthesia. He was ventilated for 48 hours; MRI brain was unremarkable, suggesting a direct pro-convulsant effect of the drug.

acute_toxicity_from_cocaine_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute epistaxis and septal perforation
  presenting_complaint: Profuse nasal bleeding that failed to stop with pressure.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male chronic snorter of cocaine presented with an acute, heavy epistaxis. Examination revealed a large nasal septal perforation with necrotic edges. The bleeding was controlled with anterior nasal packing, and he was referred to ENT for management of the chronic tissue damage exacerbated by acute vasoconstriction.

acute_toxicity_from_cocaine_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Cocaine-induced mesenteric ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Severe, out-of-proportion abdominal pain and bloody stools.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male presented with acute abdominal distress after smoking crack. CT abdomen showed pneumatosis intestinalis and lack of enhancement in the small bowel wall. He underwent emergency laparotomy where 50cm of ischaemic bowel was resected; the pathology confirmed vascular compromise consistent with cocaine-induced vasospasm.

acute_toxicity_from_cocaine_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Pneumomediastinum ("Crack Lung")
  presenting_complaint: Acute pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath.
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old female presented after smoking crack cocaine and performing a vigorous Valsalva manoeuvre. Examination revealed subcutaneous emphysema in the neck. CXR and CT confirmed pneumomediastinum without oesophageal rupture; she was managed conservatively with oxygen and analgesia.

acute_toxicity_from_cocaine_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Cocaine-induced hypertensive crisis
  presenting_complaint: Severe headache, blurred vision, and epistaxis.
  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old male presented with a blood pressure of 245/130 mmHg following intranasal cocaine use. He had signs of hypertensive retinopathy but no focal neurological deficits. He was treated with titrated IV phentolamine and oral benzodiazepines in the High Dependency Unit to safely lower his blood pressure.

acute_toxicity_from_cocaine_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Cocaine-induced cardiac arrest (Ventricular Fibrillation)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden collapse in a nightclub.
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old male suffered a witnessed cardiac arrest shortly after consuming cocaine. Bystander CPR was performed, and paramedics achieved ROSC after two shocks for ventricular fibrillation. Post-arrest care in the ICU included targeted temperature management and investigation which ruled out structural heart disease, pointing to cocaine-induced arrhythmogenesis.
