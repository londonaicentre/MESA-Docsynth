  primary_diagnosis: Carotid Sinus Hypersensitivity
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent syncope while shaving or wearing tight collars
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male reported multiple episodes of lightheadedness and LOC triggered by neck movements. Carotid sinus massage under continuous ECG monitoring induced a 4-second asystolic pause. He was diagnosed with the cardioinhibitory subtype of carotid sinus syndrome and managed with a permanent pacemaker.

syncope_collapse_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Psychogenic Pseudosyncope
  presenting_complaint: Multiple daily episodes of prolonged unresponsiveness
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female with a history of anxiety presented with frequent "blackouts" lasting up to 10 minutes. During episodes, her eyes were tightly closed, and there were no changes in heart rate, blood pressure, or EEG readings. Multi-disciplinary management involving neurology and psychiatry was initiated to address the underlying psychological distress.

syncope_collapse_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Subclavian Steal Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Vertigo and syncope triggered by left arm exercise
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female experienced syncope while hanging laundry. Investigations revealed a 40mmHg blood pressure discrepancy between her arms and retrograde flow in the left vertebral artery on Doppler ultrasound. She was diagnosed with subclavian artery stenosis and underwent successful percutaneous angioplasty and stenting.

syncope_collapse_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Drug-Induced Torsades de Pointes
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent syncope following initiation of antibiotics
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female with a history of long QT syndrome was prescribed erythromycin for a chest infection. She suffered multiple syncopal episodes; telemetry captured paroxysms of Torsades de Pointes. The offending medication was stopped, electrolytes were corrected, and she was stabilised in the coronary care unit.

syncope_collapse_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Ruptured Ectopic Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Acute abdominal pain and collapse in a young woman
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female was brought to A&E after collapsing at home. She was hypotensive (BP 80/40) and tachycardic with severe lower abdominal tenderness. A positive bedside pregnancy test and ultrasound showing free fluid in the pelvis led to an emergency laparotomy for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy and haemoperitoneum.

  primary_diagnosis: Post-Prandial Hypotension
  presenting_complaint: Dizziness and collapse shortly after eating lunch
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old male with Parkinson's disease reported recurrent episodes of syncope occurring 45 minutes after large meals. Serial blood pressure monitoring confirmed a significant drop in systolic BP following carbohydrate-rich meals. Management included smaller, more frequent meals and avoiding antihypertensive medications before eating.

syncope_collapse_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (PoTS)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic pre-syncope and occasional collapse on standing
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female presented with a 6-month history of palpitations and near-fainting when standing. A tilt table test demonstrated a sustained heart rate increase of 45 bpm without a significant drop in blood pressure. She was managed with increased salt and fluid intake, compression stockings, and eventually ivabradine.

syncope_collapse_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Brugada Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Syncope during a febrile illness
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male of Southeast Asian descent collapsed while suffering from a high fever due to influenza. His ECG showed the characteristic Type 1 coved ST-segment elevation in V1-V2. Given the history of syncope and the high-risk ECG pattern, he was referred for an electrophysiology study and subsequent ICD implantation.

  primary_diagnosis: Malignant Vasovagal Syncope
  presenting_complaint: Frequent, unpredictable collapse with no prodrome
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female experienced recurrent, severe syncopal episodes leading to multiple injuries. An implantable loop recorder (ILR) captured a spontaneous episode associated with a 9-second period of asystole. Despite the diagnosis being reflex syncope, the severity and lack of prodrome necessitated the insertion of a permanent pacemaker.

syncope_collapse_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Sick Sinus Syndrome (Tachy-Brady Syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations followed by sudden collapse
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male reported episodes of rapid heartbeats followed by a "thumping" sensation and LOC. 24-hour Holter monitoring showed periods of atrial fibrillation followed by prolonged sinus pauses of up to 5 seconds upon reversion to sinus rhythm. He was treated with a combination of a permanent pacemaker and beta-blockers for rate control.
