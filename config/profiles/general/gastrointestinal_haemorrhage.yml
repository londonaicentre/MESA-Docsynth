gastrointestinal_haemorrhage_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Bleeding Duodenal Ulcer
  presenting_complaint: Haematemesis and melaena
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with long-term NSAID use for osteoarthritis presented with sudden onset coffee-ground vomit and black, tarry stools. Urgent OGD revealed a Forrest Ib oozing ulcer in the duodenal bulb, which was treated with adrenaline injection and heater probe thermocoagulation. He was discharged on high-dose oral PPIs after 72 hours of stability.

gastrointestinal_haemorrhage_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Oesophageal Variceal Haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Massive haematemesis and hypotension
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female with known alcoholic cirrhosis presented in haemorrhagic shock with profuse bright red haematemesis. Following resuscitation with O-negative blood and Terlipressin, emergency endoscopy confirmed Grade IV varices with active spurting. Haemorrhage was controlled via endoscopic variceal band ligation (EVBL), and she was transferred to ICU for ongoing management of hepatic encephalopathy.

gastrointestinal_haemorrhage_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Diverticular Haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Painless brisk haematochezia
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male on apixaban for atrial fibrillation presented with the passage of a large volume of bright red blood per rectum without abdominal pain. Haemoglobin dropped from 135g/L to 88g/L over 12 hours, requiring a two-unit transfusion. Colonoscopy identified active bleeding from a diverticulum in the sigmoid colon, which was successfully managed with endoscopic clipping.

gastrointestinal_haemorrhage_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Mallory-Weiss Tear
  presenting_complaint: Haematemesis following forceful vomiting
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male presented to A&E after several episodes of forceful vomiting following heavy alcohol consumption, noting fresh blood in the final vomit. OGD identified a non-bleeding linear mucosal tear at the gastro-oesophageal junction. He remained haemodynamically stable and was managed conservatively with anti-emetics and discharge advice.

gastrointestinal_haemorrhage_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Meckel's Diverticulum
  presenting_complaint: Painless maroon-coloured stools
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old boy presented with acute onset of painless, large-volume maroon stools and pallor. A Technetium-99m pertechnetate scan (Meckel's scan) showed increased uptake in the right lower quadrant, suggestive of ectopic gastric mucosa. He underwent laparoscopic resection of the diverticulum, which confirmed an ulcerated Meckel's diverticulum on histology.

gastrointestinal_haemorrhage_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Angiodysplasia of the Caecum
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent iron deficiency anaemia and occult bleeding
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old female with aortic stenosis presented with symptomatic anaemia and positive faecal immunochemical testing (FIT). Repeated OGD and colonoscopy were initially unremarkable, but a subsequent capsule endoscopy identified multiple vascular malformations in the caecum. She was treated with argon plasma coagulation (APC) during a repeat colonoscopy, leading to stabilisation of her haemoglobin.

gastrointestinal_haemorrhage_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Ischaemic Colitis
  presenting_complaint: Left-sided abdominal pain followed by bloody diarrhoea
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male with peripheral vascular disease presented with acute, cramping left-sided abdominal pain and subsequent passage of small volumes of bright red blood mixed with stool. CT abdomen showed thickening of the splenic flexure and descending colon. Flexible sigmoidoscopy confirmed dusky, oedematous mucosa consistent with ischaemia, which resolved with conservative management and intravenous fluids.

gastrointestinal_haemorrhage_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-polypectomy Haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Delayed rectal bleeding post-procedure
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male presented 5 days after a screening colonoscopy and resection of a 25mm sessile polyp in the ascending colon with fresh rectal bleeding. He was haemodynamically stable but had a significant drop in haemoglobin. Repeat colonoscopy identified a bleeding vessel at the base of the previous resection site, which was treated with mechanical clips and adrenaline.

gastrointestinal_haemorrhage_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Dieulafoy Lesion
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent, massive haematemesis
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented with two episodes of sudden, massive haematemesis three days apart, with a normal initial OGD. A second, more meticulous OGD during an active bleeding episode identified a minute mucosal defect with a protruding, spurting artery in the proximal gastric body. The lesion was successfully treated with endoscopic band ligation and she had no further recurrence.

gastrointestinal_haemorrhage_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Gastric Antral Vascular Ectasia (GAVE)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic anaemia and melaena
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female with systemic sclerosis presented with transfusion-dependent iron deficiency anaemia and intermittent melaena. OGD revealed characteristic longitudinal erythematous strips in the antrum (watermelon stomach). She required multiple sessions of argon plasma coagulation (APC) over six months to reduce transfusion requirements and control the chronic blood loss.

gastrointestinal_haemorrhage_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Ulcerative Colitis (Acute Severe Flare)
  presenting_complaint: Bloody diarrhoea and tenesmus
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male with a known diagnosis of ulcerative colitis presented with 12 episodes of bloody diarrhoea per day, tachycardia, and elevated CRP. Flexible sigmoidoscopy showed continuous, circumferential inflammation with deep ulceration and spontaneous bleeding (Mayo Grade 3). He was treated with intravenous hydrocortisone and later transitioned to Infliximab due to inadequate response to steroids.

gastrointestinal_haemorrhage_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Aorto-enteric Fistula
  presenting_complaint: Herald bleed followed by catastrophic haematemesis
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with a history of an open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair 4 years ago presented with a self-limiting episode of melaena (herald bleed). Twelve hours later, he developed catastrophic haematemesis and cardiovascular collapse. Emergency CT angiography confirmed a fistula between the aortic graft and the third part of the duodenum; he was taken for emergency vascular surgery but unfortunately died intraoperatively.

gastrointestinal_haemorrhage_013:
  primary_diagnosis: NSAID-induced Small Bowel Ulceration
  presenting_complaint: Obscure gastrointestinal bleeding and IDA
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female taking high-dose naproxen for chronic back pain presented with persistent iron deficiency anaemia despite normal OGD and colonoscopy. A video capsule endoscopy revealed multiple "punched-out" ulcers in the mid-jejunum with evidence of recent haemorrhage. NSAIDs were discontinued, and her haemoglobin normalised over the following three months with iron supplementation.

gastrointestinal_haemorrhage_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Internal Haemorrhoids
  presenting_complaint: Bright red blood on the toilet paper and dripping into the bowl
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old pregnant female presented with painless, bright red bleeding associated with defecation and a sensation of rectal fullness. Digital rectal examination and proctoscopy confirmed Grade II internal haemorrhoids with signs of recent bleeding. She was managed conservatively with stool softeners, topical anaesthetics, and dietary fibre, with symptomatic improvement.

gastrointestinal_haemorrhage_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Gastric Adenocarcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Chronic melaena, weight loss, and early satiety
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male presented with a three-month history of unintentional weight loss and intermittent black stools. OGD revealed a large, friable, ulcerated mass on the lesser curvature of the stomach which bled easily on contact. Biopsies confirmed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, and he was referred to the oncology MDT for staging and neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

gastrointestinal_haemorrhage_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Radiation Proctitis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent rectal bleeding and urgency
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male who underwent pelvic radiotherapy for prostate cancer two years prior presented with persistent streaks of red blood in his stool and rectal tenesmus. Sigmoidoscopy showed multiple telangiectasias and friable mucosa in the rectum, consistent with chronic radiation-induced changes. He was treated with several sessions of argon plasma coagulation, which significantly reduced the frequency of bleeding.

gastrointestinal_haemorrhage_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Haemorrhagic Gastritis
  presenting_complaint: Epigastric pain and coffee-ground emesis
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male presented with acute epigastric pain and small-volume haematemesis after a weekend of heavy binge drinking and aspirin use. OGD showed diffuse, petechial haemorrhages and erosions throughout the gastric mucosa without a focal ulcer. He was treated with a 4-week course of PPIs and advised on alcohol cessation, with complete resolution of symptoms.

gastrointestinal_haemorrhage_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Hookworm Infestation (Necator americanus)
  presenting_complaint: Severe anaemia and positive occult blood
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male recently returned from a long-term backpacking trip in Southeast Asia presented with profound lethargy and iron deficiency anaemia (Hb 62g/L). Faecal occult blood was positive, and stool microscopy eventually identified hookworm ova. He was treated with a single dose of albendazole and oral iron, leading to a rapid recovery of his haemoglobin levels.

gastrointestinal_haemorrhage_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Crohn's Disease (Terminal Ileal Bleeding)
  presenting_complaint: Right iliac fossa pain and melaena
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female with known ileal Crohn's disease presented with an exacerbation of abdominal pain and several episodes of melaena. MRE showed active inflammation and a small phlegmon in the terminal ileum, while ileocolonoscopy confirmed deep, bleeding ulcers. She was managed with bowel rest, intravenous steroids, and an escalation of her maintenance therapy to Ustekinumab.

gastrointestinal_haemorrhage_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Stress-induced Gastric Ulceration
  presenting_complaint: Blood in nasogastric aspirate
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male in the ICU for multi-organ failure following severe sepsis developed fresh blood in his nasogastric tube aspirate. Despite being on prophylactic ranitidine, OGD showed multiple shallow "stress ulcers" in the gastric fundus with diffuse oozing. Management included switching to intravenous PPI infusion and optimisation of haemodynamics, which successfully halted the bleeding.
