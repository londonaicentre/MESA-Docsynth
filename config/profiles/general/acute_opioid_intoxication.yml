  primary_diagnosis: Tramadol-induced serotonin syndrome and toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Agitation, tremors, and pinpoint pupils
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female on fluoxetine took an overdose of tramadol. She presented with a mixture of opioid toxidrome (miosis) and serotonergic features (hyperreflexia, clonus, and tachycardia). She was treated with benzodiazepines for agitation and monitored for seizures, with gradual resolution over 24 hours.

acute_toxicity_from_opioid_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Body packer syndrome with opioid toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Seizure followed by respiratory arrest
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old male "body packer" collapsed at an airport after a cocaine/heroin wrap ruptured internally. He presented with profound respiratory depression and miosis. Following resuscitation and naloxone, he underwent an emergency laparotomy to remove the remaining packets and prevent further toxicity.

acute_toxicity_from_opioid_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Buprenorphine toxicity in a non-tolerant individual
  presenting_complaint: Persistent nausea and dizziness
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old male experimented with a friend's buprenorphine sublingual tablet. Despite the drug's partial agonist properties, he developed significant nausea, vomiting, and mild respiratory depression (RR 12/min). Symptoms were prolonged due to the drug's high receptor affinity, requiring antiemetics and 12 hours of observation.

acute_toxicity_from_opioid_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema secondary to heroin overdose
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath and pink frothy sputum
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female was reversed from a heroin overdose with naloxone but immediately developed severe respiratory distress. Clinical examination and chest radiography revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates consistent with opioid-induced non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. She required 24 hours of CPAP ventilation in the ICU.

acute_toxicity_from_opioid_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Remifentanil infusion accumulation post-surgery
  presenting_complaint: Delayed emergence from anaesthesia
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male underwent prolonged abdominal surgery involving a remifentanil infusion. Post-operatively, he failed to wake up and remained apnoeic despite the cessation of volatile agents. A small dose of naloxone (80mcg) successfully restored spontaneous ventilation without compromising surgical analgesia.

acute_toxicity_from_opioid_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Codeine linctus toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Confusion and pinpoint pupils in a teenager
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old male presented after consuming two bottles of over-the-counter codeine linctus ("lean"). He was euphoric but significantly sedated with a respiratory rate of 9/min. Blood gases showed mild respiratory acidosis; he was monitored in the paediatric assessment unit and discharged after 12 hours of stability.

acute_toxicity_from_opioid_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic pethidine toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Tremors and focal seizures
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old patient with sickle cell disease was receiving high doses of pethidine for a pain crisis. She developed neurotoxicity characterized by tremors and a grand mal seizure due to the accumulation of the metabolite norpethidine. Pethidine was discontinued and switched to PCA morphine, with no further seizure activity.

acute_toxicity_from_opioid_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Massive morphine sulphate (MST) ingestion
  presenting_complaint: Comatose state with bradycardia
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male ingested 2000mg of sustained-release morphine sulphate in a suicide attempt. He presented 4 hours later with GCS 3 and bradycardia. Due to the sustained-release nature, he required a naloxone infusion for 48 hours and whole bowel irrigation to prevent ongoing absorption.

acute_toxicity_from_opioid_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Precipitated withdrawal and toxicity rebound
  presenting_complaint: Agitation followed by recurrent sedation
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old heroin user was given a large bolus of naloxone (2mg) by bystanders, causing violent withdrawal. Upon arrival at A&E, the naloxone wore off before the heroin was metabolised, leading to a "rebound" respiratory arrest. He was successfully managed with a more cautious, titrated naloxone infusion.

acute_toxicity_from_opioid_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Hydromorphone toxicity in a palliative setting
  presenting_complaint: Unresponsiveness and "fish-out-of-water" breathing
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old cancer patient was accidentally administered a ten-fold overdose of hydromorphone by a caregiver. He presented with agonal respirations and miosis. He was treated with titrated doses of naloxone to restore respiration while attempting to maintain some level of comfort/analgesia.

acute_toxicity_from_opioid_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute tapentadol overdose
  presenting_complaint: Drowsiness and tachycardia
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female took 15 tablets of 100mg tapentadol. She presented with a GCS of 10, pinpoint pupils, and mild hypertension. Unlike pure opioids, tapentadol's noradrenaline reuptake inhibition caused mild tachycardia; she was monitored for 12 hours and required no naloxone as her RR remained above 12/min.

acute_toxicity_from_opioid_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Fentanyl-laced "Xanax" toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Found unconscious in a nightclub
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female arrived at A&E via ambulance after taking what she thought was alprazolam. She was deeply comatose with a respiratory rate of 5/min and pinpoint pupils. Response to naloxone was diagnostic of opioid contamination in the illicit benzodiazepine supply.

acute_toxicity_from_opioid_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute opium tincture toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Chronic constipation and worsening lethargy
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old male was using opium tincture (Gee's Linctus) for a chronic cough. Due to self-escalation of the dose and dehydration, he developed subacute toxicity with delirium, pinpoint pupils, and urinary retention. He improved significantly with IV fluids and discontinuation of the linctus.
