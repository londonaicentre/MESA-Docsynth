angina_pectoris_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic stable angina pectoris
  presenting_complaint: Exertional chest heaviness and shortness of breath
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with hypertension presented to his GP with a 3-month history of retrosternal tightness triggered by walking uphill, relieved within 5 minutes of rest. Clinical examination was unremarkable, but an exercise tolerance test demonstrated 2mm ST-segment depression in leads V4-V6. He was commenced on aspirin, atorvastatin, and bisoprolol, with sublingual GTN for symptomatic relief, resulting in good functional improvement.

angina_pectoris_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Unstable angina
  presenting_complaint: Worsening chest pain at rest
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female with known CAD presented to A&E with three episodes of chest pain at rest over the preceding 24 hours. Serial troponin T levels remained below the 99th percentile, but ECG showed transient T-wave inversion in the precordial leads during pain. She was treated with dual antiplatelet therapy and fondaparinux, and urgent coronary angiography revealed a 90% stenosis in the left circumflex artery, which was treated with a drug-eluting stent.

angina_pectoris_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Microvascular angina (Cardiac Syndrome X)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent exertional chest pain with normal coronary arteries
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old peri-menopausal female presented with typical angina symptoms and a positive myocardial perfusion scan showing reversible ischaemia. Coronary angiography demonstrated smooth, unobstructed epicardial coronary arteries. Diagnosis of microvascular dysfunction was made, and her symptoms were successfully managed with a combination of diltiazem and imipramine for visceral pain modulation.

angina_pectoris_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Prinzmetal (variant) angina
  presenting_complaint: Early morning chest pain at rest
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male smoker presented with recurrent episodes of severe nocturnal chest pain occurring at approximately 4 AM. Ambulatory ECG monitoring captured transient ST-segment elevation during an episode, which resolved rapidly with sublingual nitrates. Angiography showed no fixed stenoses but documented focal vasospasm upon provocative testing, leading to treatment with high-dose calcium channel blockers.

angina_pectoris_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory angina pectoris
  presenting_complaint: Chronic, debilitating chest pain despite maximal medical therapy
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with previous CABG and multiple PCIs continued to experience Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Class IV angina. He was on four anti-anginal medications and was not a candidate for further revascularisation due to poor distal targets. He was referred to the pain management team for consideration of a spinal cord stimulator and started on ranolazine to improve quality of life.

angina_pectoris_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Angina secondary to severe aortic stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Exertional chest pain and lightheadedness
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old female presented with angina on minimal exertion and one episode of near-syncope. Examination revealed a loud ejection systolic murmur radiating to the carotids, and echocardiography confirmed severe aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 45 mmHg. Coronary arteries were found to be clear on CTCA, indicating the angina was due to increased myocardial oxygen demand and reduced coronary perfusion pressure, necessitating an urgent TAVI.

angina_pectoris_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Angina pectoris precipitated by profound anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Chest pain and lethargy
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with a history of stable CAD presented with increased frequency of angina and pallor. Blood tests revealed a haemoglobin of 62g/L due to occult gastrointestinal bleeding from a gastric ulcer. The reduction in oxygen-carrying capacity triggered myocardial ischaemia; symptoms resolved completely following blood transfusion and endoscopic haemostasis without the need for further cardiac intervention.

angina_pectoris_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Silent myocardial ischaemia in Type 2 Diabetes
  presenting_complaint: Unexplained exertional dyspnoea
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with long-standing poorly controlled diabetes and peripheral neuropathy complained of progressive breathlessness during exercise but denied chest pain. A stress echocardiogram revealed new regional wall motion abnormalities in the LAD territory at peak heart rate. Subsequent angiography showed significant multi-vessel disease, highlighting the lack of typical anginal warning signs in diabetic autonomic neuropathy.

angina_pectoris_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-infarction angina
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent chest pain 48 hours after MI
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male who underwent primary PCI for an inferior STEMI developed recurrent retrosternal tightness while in the coronary care unit. ECG showed new ST-depression in the lateral leads, suggesting ischaemia in a non-infarct-related artery. He returned to the catheter lab where a subtotal occlusion of the left circumflex artery was identified and stented, resolving the symptoms.

angina_pectoris_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Angina decubitus
  presenting_complaint: Chest pain when lying flat at night
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old female with ischaemic cardiomyopathy and a low ejection fraction reported chest tightness that occurred shortly after reclining in bed. This was attributed to increased venous return and cardiac workload in the supine position. Optimisation of her heart failure regimen with increased diuretics and the addition of a nitrate patch in the evening significantly reduced the frequency of these nocturnal episodes.

angina_pectoris_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Premature angina due to Familial Hypercholesterolaemia
  presenting_complaint: Exertional chest pain in a young adult
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male with a strong family history of early sudden cardiac death presented with CCS Class II angina. Physical examination noted bilateral xanthelasmata and a total cholesterol of 9.4 mmol/L. Coronary angiography revealed significant proximal LAD stenosis, requiring PCI and aggressive lipid-lowering therapy with high-dose statins and PCSK9 inhibitors.

angina_pectoris_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Angina pectoris induced by thyrotoxicosis
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations and chest tightness
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female presented with weight loss, tremors, and new-onset exertional angina. Investigations confirmed Graves' disease with a suppressed TSH and elevated Free T4. The hypermetabolic state and associated tachycardia increased myocardial oxygen demand, unmasking underlying mild coronary artery disease; symptoms resolved once a euthyroid state was achieved with carbimazole and beta-blockers.

angina_pectoris_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Cocaine-induced vasospastic angina
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset severe retrosternal chest pain
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male presented to A&E with crushing chest pain and diaphoresis following intranasal cocaine use. ECG showed transient ST-segment elevation that resolved spontaneously within 30 minutes. Troponins were mildly elevated, but coronary angiography showed no obstructive lesions, confirming drug-induced coronary vasospasm; he was treated with benzodiazepines and nitrates, and advised on substance cessation.

angina_pectoris_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Angina pectoris in End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)
  presenting_complaint: Chest pain during haemodialysis sessions
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male on long-term haemodialysis experienced recurrent angina specifically during the last hour of his dialysis sessions, coinciding with fluid removal and hypotension. CT coronary angiography showed heavy circumferential vascular calcification. Management involved adjusting his dry weight targets, slowing the ultrafiltration rate, and initiating midodrine to maintain intradialytic blood pressure and coronary perfusion.

angina_pectoris_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent angina due to coronary stent restenosis
  presenting_complaint: Return of exertional symptoms 6 months post-PCI
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male who had a drug-eluting stent to his RCA six months ago reported a return of his original exertional chest pain. Repeat angiography confirmed in-stent restenosis (ISR) with 80% luminal narrowing. The lesion was treated with a drug-coated balloon (DCB), and his dual antiplatelet therapy was reviewed and extended.

angina_pectoris_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Nocturnal angina associated with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA)
  presenting_complaint: Waking up with chest pain and gasping
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old obese male complained of being woken by chest heaviness in the middle of the night. A sleep study confirmed severe OSA with significant nocturnal desaturations, which were found to trigger episodes of myocardial ischaemia on a simultaneous Holter monitor. Treatment with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy led to the resolution of both his sleep apnoea and his nocturnal anginal symptoms.

angina_pectoris_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Tachycardia-mediated angina
  presenting_complaint: Rapid palpitations followed by chest pain
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) presented with an episode of AF with a rapid ventricular response of 160 bpm. During the episode, she developed typical anginal chest pain and 1mm ST-depression on ECG. Once the heart rate was controlled with intravenous digoxin and bisoprolol, the chest pain and ECG changes resolved, indicating the ischaemia was rate-related.

angina_pectoris_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Angina pectoris with COPD diagnostic overlap
  presenting_complaint: Chest tightness and wheezing on exertion
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old heavy smoker with known COPD presented with worsening "breathlessness" that was actually a heavy chest sensation. Distinguishing between a COPD flare and angina was difficult until a dobutamine stress echo showed reversible ischaemia in the RCA territory. He was started on cardioselective beta-blockers (bisoprolol) and nitrates, which improved his exercise tolerance significantly compared to bronchodilators alone.

angina_pectoris_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe multi-vessel angina in a frail elderly patient
  presenting_complaint: Angina on minimal ADLs (Activities of Daily Living)
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old frail female with multiple comorbidities including dementia presented with chest pain when dressing. Coronary angiography showed complex three-vessel disease, but she was deemed high-risk for both CABG and PCI by the heart team. A conservative management plan was adopted, focusing on symptom control with isosorbide mononitrate and low-dose carvedilol, alongside palliative care input.

angina_pectoris_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Angina pectoris with normal ECG and stress test (Diagnostic challenge)
  presenting_complaint: Typical exertional chest pain but negative initial workup
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented with classic exertional symptoms, but both his resting ECG and exercise treadmill test were normal. Due to high clinical suspicion, he underwent a CT Coronary Angiogram which revealed a significant soft plaque causing a 75% stenosis in a large diagonal branch. He was successfully treated with PCI, demonstrating that a negative stress test does not always exclude significant obstructive angina.
