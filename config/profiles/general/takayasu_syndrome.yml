takayasu_syndrome_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Type I Takayasu Arteritis
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral arm claudication and syncopal episodes.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female presented with exertional arm pain and dizziness. Examination revealed absent radial pulses and a loud bruit over the left carotid artery. MRA confirmed significant narrowing of the brachiocephalic trunk and left subclavian artery. She was commenced on high-dose prednisolone and methotrexate, showing good clinical response with stabilisation of vascular lesions at six months.

takayasu_syndrome_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Type IV Takayasu Arteritis with Renovascular Hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Severe headache and blurred vision.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old girl was admitted with a blood pressure of 210/115 mmHg and hypertensive retinopathy. Investigations revealed bilateral renal artery stenosis and thickening of the abdominal aorta. Following stabilisation with intravenous labetalol, she underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and started mycophenolate mofetil. Her blood pressure is now well-controlled on dual antihypertensive therapy.

takayasu_syndrome_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Type V Takayasu Arteritis with Aortic Regurgitation
  presenting_complaint: Progressive dyspnoea and orthopnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old woman with a history of treated Takayasu syndrome presented with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III heart failure. Echocardiography demonstrated severe aortic regurgitation and a dilated aortic root (4.8 cm). She underwent a Bentall procedure and escalation of immunosuppression to tocilizumab due to evidence of active vascular inflammation on PET-CT.

takayasu_syndrome_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Ischaemic Stroke secondary to Takayasu Arteritis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset right-sided weakness and aphasia.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female presented acutely to the stroke unit; CTA head and neck revealed a left middle cerebral artery infarct and near-complete occlusion of the left common carotid artery with vessel wall enhancement. Further imaging showed extensive involvement of the thoracic aorta. She received thrombolysis followed by urgent pulsed methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide to manage the underlying vasculitis.

takayasu_syndrome_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Pre-pulseless Takayasu Arteritis
  presenting_complaint: Unexplained fever, night sweats, and weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female underwent extensive investigation for pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO) with an ESR of 110 mm/hr. While initial CT was unremarkable, a PET-CT demonstrated intense FDG uptake throughout the aortic arch and descending aorta despite normal peripheral pulses. Diagnosis of early-stage Takayasu was made, and she achieved remission with prednisolone and azathioprine.

takayasu_syndrome_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Type III Takayasu Arteritis with Mesenteric Ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Post-prandial abdominal pain and significant weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male presented with "abdominal angina" and a 15kg weight loss over six months. Angiography showed significant stenosis of the superior mesenteric artery and the infrarenal aorta. He required nutritional support via TPN before undergoing mesenteric artery stenting and starting long-term immunosuppression with leflunomide.

takayasu_syndrome_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Takayasu Arteritis with Pulmonary Artery Involvement
  presenting_complaint: Pleuritic chest pain and haemoptysis.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female was initially treated for a suspected pulmonary embolism; however, V/Q scan and CTPA showed peripheral pulmonary artery stenoses rather than thrombus. Subsequent MRI of the large vessels confirmed Takayasu syndrome involving the pulmonary trunk and thoracic aorta. She responded well to a combination of corticosteroids and infliximab.

takayasu_syndrome_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Takayasu Arteritis with Subclavian Steal Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent vertigo and drop attacks when using the left arm.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old woman with a 10-year history of Takayasu syndrome presented with vertebrobasilar insufficiency. Doppler ultrasound confirmed retrograde flow in the left vertebral artery due to proximal left subclavian occlusion. Given the burnt-out nature of the disease (normal inflammatory markers), she was managed with a carotid-subclavian bypass graft with excellent symptomatic relief.

takayasu_syndrome_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Takayasu Arteritis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent carotidynia and rising inflammatory markers.
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old female failed to achieve remission despite sequential trials of methotrexate, azathioprine, and tocilizumab. Repeat MRA showed new stenoses in the right renal and carotid arteries. She was eventually transitioned to rituximab as part of a clinical trial, which successfully lowered her CRP and stabilised the vascular wall thickening.

takayasu_syndrome_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Takayasu Arteritis in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Routine obstetric review at 24 weeks gestation with high blood pressure.
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old pregnant woman with known Takayasu syndrome developed worsening hypertension (165/100 mmHg). Distinguishing between pre-eclampsia and vasculitis progression was challenging; however, stable proteinuria and active wall thickening on MRI without gadolinium suggested a Takayasu flare. She was managed with increased prednisolone and nifedipine, delivering a healthy infant via elective caesarean section at 37 weeks.

takayasu_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Type IIb Takayasu Arteritis with Ocular Ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Transient monocular blindness (amaurosis fugax).
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old female reported frequent episodes of "curtain descending" over her right eye. Fundoscopy revealed venous stasis retinopathy, and CTA showed severe stenosis of the right internal carotid and innominate arteries. She was treated with high-dose steroids and urgent angioplasty to prevent permanent visual loss, followed by maintenance therapy with baricitinib.

takayasu_syndrome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Takayasu Arteritis mimicking Polymyalgia Rheumatica
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral shoulder stiffness and scalp tenderness.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female was initially treated for PMR/GCA, but her symptoms were refractory to standard steroid doses. A vascular review noted a 30 mmHg blood pressure discrepancy between arms and a bruit over the subclavian artery. Large-vessel vasculitis (Takayasu) was confirmed on MRA, highlighting the diagnostic challenge in older patients where it may overlap with GCA.

takayasu_syndrome_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Takayasu Arteritis with Coronary Artery Involvement
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset substernal chest pain and diaphoresis.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female presented with an NSTEMI; coronary angiography revealed 90% ostial stenosis of the left main stem with smooth tapering, characteristic of Takayasu involvement. She underwent urgent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) using a venous graft, as the internal mammary arteries were involved in the vasculitic process. Post-operative recovery was managed with cyclophosphamide.

takayasu_syndrome_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Takayasu Arteritis with Growth Retardation
  presenting_complaint: Generalised malaise, poor growth, and leg pain.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old girl presented below the 3rd centile for height and weight with intermittent claudication of the lower limbs. Examination revealed impalpable femoral pulses and a mid-abdominal bruit. Imaging showed a "mummified" abdominal aorta with severe narrowing. She was started on a paediatric protocol of prednisolone and methotrexate, resulting in significant "catch-up" growth and improved perfusion.

takayasu_syndrome_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Takayasu Arteritis with Flash Pulmonary Oedema
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset severe breathlessness at rest.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old female was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress and a BP of 220/120 mmHg. Renal artery dopplers confirmed "Pickering syndrome" due to bilateral high-grade renal artery stenosis from Takayasu syndrome. Following stabilisation with a nitrate infusion, she underwent bilateral renal artery stenting and commenced intensive immunosuppression.

takayasu_syndrome_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Takayasu Arteritis associated with Crohn's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Bloody diarrhoea and new onset limb numbness.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male with known Crohn's disease presented with a flare of colitis and asymmetric peripheral pulses. MRA confirmed Type II Takayasu syndrome. Given the shared TNF-alpha-mediated pathway, he was commenced on infliximab, which successfully induced remission of both his inflammatory bowel disease and the large-vessel vasculitis.

takayasu_syndrome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Type V Takayasu Arteritis with Aortic Aneurysm
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of a widened mediastinum on chest X-ray.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male smoker was investigated for a persistent cough; CT revealed a 6.5 cm saccular aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta. Despite his age and smoking history, the presence of thickened vessel walls and high inflammatory markers led to a diagnosis of Takayasu syndrome. He underwent endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) after inflammatory markers were suppressed with steroids.

takayasu_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Takayasu Arteritis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic fatigue and coldness in the right hand.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female student complained of a "heavy" feeling in her right arm during lectures. Examination found a diminished right radial pulse but normal BP in the left arm. MRA showed isolated, short-segment narrowing of the right subclavian artery. She was managed conservatively with low-dose aspirin and azathioprine, remaining stable at two-year follow-up.

takayasu_syndrome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Takayasu Arteritis presenting as Raynaud's Phenomenon
  presenting_complaint: Colour changes and pain in fingers of the left hand.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old female was referred to rheumatology for suspected Raynaud's. However, the symptoms were strictly unilateral, and the left brachial pulse was absent. MRA showed total occlusion of the left axillary artery. She was diagnosed with Takayasu syndrome and started on mycophenolate mofetil, with significant improvement in digital perfusion.

takayasu_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Takayasu Arteritis with Hypertensive Encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: New onset seizures and confusion.
  summary_of_course: A 17-year-old girl was brought to A&E following a generalised tonic-clonic seizure. Her BP was 230/130 mmHg, and MRI brain showed Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES). Further vascular imaging revealed extensive narrowing of the supra-renal aorta. She was treated with IV nitroprusside and high-dose dexamethasone, eventually transitioning to oral cyclophosphamide for long-term management.
