candidal_sepsis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Candidal sepsis following renal transplant
  presenting_complaint: Fever and graft tenderness
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male, three weeks post-renal transplant, presented with pyrexia and oliguria. Blood cultures identified Candida albicans, likely originating from a peri-graft collection. Immunosuppression was reduced, and he was treated with fluconazole for 21 days with preservation of the graft.

candidal_sepsis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic candidal sepsis
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice and worsening encephalopathy
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis was admitted with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Despite initial improvement on cephalosporins, he deteriorated with new-onset fungaemia (Candida glabrata). He was treated with caspofungin but succumbed to progressive liver failure.
