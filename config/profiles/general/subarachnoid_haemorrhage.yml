subarachnoid_haemorrhage_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden-onset "thunderclap" headache and vomiting.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented with a WFNS Grade 1 headache. Non-contrast CT head confirmed SAH in the basal cisterns, and CT angiogram (CTA) identified a 6mm anterior communicating artery aneurysm. She underwent successful endovascular coiling and was discharged after 14 days of oral nimodipine with no focal deficits.

subarachnoid_haemorrhage_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Benign perimesencephalic subarachnoid haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset occipital headache and neck stiffness.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented with a severe headache but remained neurologically intact (GCS 15). CT showed blood restricted to the perimesencephalic cistern, and subsequent digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was negative for vascular malformations. He was managed conservatively on the neurosurgical ward and made a full recovery within one week.

subarachnoid_haemorrhage_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (WFNS Grade V)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden collapse and loss of consciousness.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with atrial fibrillation was brought to A&E with a GCS of 3 and a fixed, dilated right pupil. CT head demonstrated massive SAH with intraventricular extension and hydrocephalus. Given her significant frailty and the extent of the primary brain injury, a palliative approach was agreed upon following multidisciplinary discussion.

subarachnoid_haemorrhage_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric subarachnoid haemorrhage secondary to Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden severe headache followed by a generalised tonic-clonic seizure.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy presented with acute meningism and post-ictal confusion. Imaging revealed a right parietal SAH and an underlying Spetzler-Martin Grade II AVM. He underwent emergency haematoma evacuation and subsequent stereotactic radiosurgery for the residual nidus, with good functional recovery.

subarachnoid_haemorrhage_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Sentinel bleed (Subacute presentation)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent "warning" headache and photophobia for eight days.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female reported a sudden, severe headache a week prior which had partially subsided. Initial non-contrast CT head was negative, but lumbar puncture revealed xanthochromia on spectrophotometry. CTA confirmed a small posterior communicating artery aneurysm, which was subsequently treated with endovascular coiling.

subarachnoid_haemorrhage_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Subarachnoid haemorrhage complicated by delayed cerebral ischaemia (DCI)
  presenting_complaint: Right-sided weakness and expressive aphasia seven days post-ictus.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female was recovering from an initial Grade II SAH treated with coiling. On day 7, she developed new focal neurological deficits despite nimodipine prophylaxis. Transcranial Doppler confirmed severe vasospasm, and she was managed in ICU with induced hypertension (triple-H therapy) and intra-arterial verapamil, resulting in partial symptom resolution.

subarachnoid_haemorrhage_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Subarachnoid haemorrhage with acute hydrocephalus
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly declining level of consciousness and upward gaze palsy.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male presented with a Grade III SAH. Serial CT scans showed progressive ventricular enlargement and periventricular lucency. An external ventricular drain (EVD) was inserted urgently to relieve intracranial pressure, followed by definitive aneurysm clipping and later conversion to a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt.

subarachnoid_haemorrhage_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Mycotic aneurysm rupture secondary to infective endocarditis
  presenting_complaint: Fever, malaise, and sudden onset of left-sided weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use presented with sepsis and an acute SAH. Echocardiography showed mitral valve vegetations, and CTA identified a distal middle cerebral artery mycotic aneurysm. He was treated with long-term intravenous antibiotics and neurosurgical clipping of the unstable aneurysm.

subarachnoid_haemorrhage_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Confusion and scalp laceration following a fall.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male on clopidogrel fell from a height, striking his head. CT showed focal SAH within the cortical sulci of the frontal lobes without basal cistern involvement. He was monitored for 48 hours for neuro-deterioration, and his antiplatelet medication was temporarily held; he was discharged following a stable repeat scan.

subarachnoid_haemorrhage_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Rebleeding of intracranial aneurysm
  presenting_complaint: Sudden respiratory arrest while awaiting neurosurgical intervention.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female was admitted with a Grade II SAH from a large basilar tip aneurysm. While being prepared for coiling, she suffered a sudden apnoeic episode and GCS drop to 3. Repeat CT showed massive rebleeding into the subarachnoid space and ventricles; she unfortunately died despite resuscitative efforts.

subarachnoid_haemorrhage_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome (RCVS) with cortical SAH
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent "thunderclap" headaches over three days.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female, six weeks postpartum, presented with multiple brief, excruciating headaches. MRI/MRA showed focal convexity SAH and "string-of-beads" vasoconstriction of the cerebral arteries. She was treated with verapamil and avoided triggers, with complete resolution of vasoconstriction on follow-up imaging at three months.

subarachnoid_haemorrhage_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Warfarin-associated spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Severe headache and drowsiness with an INR of 4.5.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male on warfarin for a prosthetic heart valve presented with acute SAH. He received immediate reversal with prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and Vitamin K. Angiography was negative, suggesting the haemorrhage was likely exacerbated by over-anticoagulation, and he was managed conservatively with serial neurological observations.

subarachnoid_haemorrhage_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Spinal subarachnoid haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Sudden-onset interscapular pain followed by ascending leg weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female presented with "coup de poignard" back pain and subsequent headache. Initial CT head was normal, but MRI of the spine revealed a spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) with associated subarachnoid blood. She underwent successful surgical ligation of the fistula and intensive physiotherapy for residual paraparesis.

subarachnoid_haemorrhage_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Aneurysmal SAH in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD)
  presenting_complaint: Acute headache and known family history of "brain bleeds."
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male with ADPKD and hypertension presented with a Grade I SAH. CTA identified multiple intracranial aneurysms, with a ruptured 5mm internal carotid artery aneurysm. He underwent endovascular coiling of the ruptured lesion and was scheduled for elective monitoring of the remaining unruptured aneurysms.

subarachnoid_haemorrhage_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Subarachnoid haemorrhage complicated by Cerebral Salt Wasting (CSW)
  presenting_complaint: Increasing confusion and profound polyuria post-SAH.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female, five days post-aneurysm coiling, developed severe hyponatraemia (Na+ 122 mmol/L) and hypovolaemia. Despite initial suspicion of SIADH, her high urine output and low central venous pressure confirmed CSW. She required aggressive volume replacement with isotonic and hypertonic saline in the HDU to maintain cerebral perfusion.

subarachnoid_haemorrhage_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Misdiagnosed subarachnoid haemorrhage (Diagnostic failure)
  presenting_complaint: Repeated ED visits for "atypical migraine."
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old female was twice discharged from A&E with analgesia for a sudden headache. She returned a third time with neck stiffness and a third-nerve palsy. Lumbar puncture confirmed xanthochromia, and DSA revealed a large posterior communicating artery aneurysm that had been slowly leaking; she underwent urgent clipping.

subarachnoid_haemorrhage_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Cocaine-induced aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Agitation and sudden collapse following drug ingestion.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male presented with acute hypertension (BP 210/115) and GCS 9 after using cocaine. CT showed a diffuse SAH, and CTA confirmed a ruptured middle cerebral artery aneurysm. He required aggressive blood pressure control with intravenous labetalol before undergoing emergency neurosurgical clipping.

subarachnoid_haemorrhage_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Subarachnoid haemorrhage in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Sudden collapse during the third trimester of pregnancy.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female at 34 weeks gestation presented with a Grade IV SAH. A multidisciplinary team performed an emergency Caesarean section followed immediately by endovascular coiling of a ruptured splenic artery aneurysm (initially misidentified, later corrected to a cerebral aneurysm on full imaging). Both mother and neonate survived, though the mother required long-term rehabilitation.

subarachnoid_haemorrhage_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic/Organising subarachnoid haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Two weeks of dull headache, low-grade fever, and mild confusion.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female presented with subacute symptoms. CT head showed isodense fluid in the basal cisterns, and MRI confirmed late-stage blood products consistent with a two-week-old SAH. Angiography revealed a small aneurysm that had likely undergone spontaneous thrombosis, but she was still treated with elective coiling to prevent future rupture.

subarachnoid_haemorrhage_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Subarachnoid haemorrhage with Neurogenic Pulmonary Oedema (NPO)
  presenting_complaint: Acute respiratory distress and pink frothy sputum following a "thunderclap" headache.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male presented with a Grade III SAH and rapid onset of hypoxia. Chest X-ray showed bilateral alveolar infiltrates despite no history of cardiac disease, consistent with NPO. He required mechanical ventilation and careful fluid management in ICU while his ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm was secured via endovascular coiling.
