cardiac_tamponade_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent malignant cardiac tamponade
  presenting_complaint: Refractory breathlessness despite previous drainage
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male with metastatic breast cancer (male) presented with his third episode of tamponade in two months. Previous needle pericardiocentesis provided only temporary relief. A permanent pericardial window (pericardio-peritoneal) was created surgically to provide long-term palliation of his symptoms.

cardiac_tamponade_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic cardiac tamponade
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of chronic shortness of breath
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old patient with a known "stable" 1.5cm idiopathic effusion presented with acute dyspnoea and a BP of 90/60 mmHg. Repeat echo showed the effusion had increased to 3.5cm following a minor viral pleurisy. Urgent drainage was required as the compensatory mechanisms for the chronic fluid were overwhelmed by the acute increase.
