rheumatoid_arthritis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Seropositive Rheumatoid Arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Symmetrical small joint pain and morning stiffness lasting 2 hours.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented to her GP with a 6-month history of bilateral MCP and PIP joint swelling. Investigations revealed elevated ESR (52 mm/hr), positive Rheumatoid Factor, and high-titre anti-CCP antibodies. She was started on Methotrexate and Folic acid with a tapering course of Prednisolone, showing significant improvement in DAS28 score at 3 months.

rheumatoid_arthritis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Elderly-Onset Rheumatoid Arthritis (EORA)
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of shoulder and hip girdle pain with profound stiffness.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male presented with subacute involvement of large proximal joints, initially mimicking polymyalgia rheumatica. Subsequent development of small joint synovitis and an ESR of 88 mm/hr led to a diagnosis of seronegative EORA. He responded well to low-dose corticosteroids and Sulfasalazine, though monitoring for cardiovascular comorbidities is ongoing.

rheumatoid_arthritis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (Polyarticular RF+)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent knee swelling and difficulty walking in the morning.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old girl with a history of polyarthritis involving 6 joints for over 6 months was diagnosed with RF-positive polyarticular JIA. Despite initial treatment with Methotrexate, she had persistent disease activity and developed early erosive changes on hand X-rays. She was successfully transitioned to Etanercept (anti-TNF therapy) with regular ophthalmology screening for uveitis.

rheumatoid_arthritis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: RA-associated Interstitial Lung Disease (RA-ILD)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive exertional dyspnoea and dry cough.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male with long-standing, poorly controlled seropositive RA presented with bibasilar fine inspiratory crackles. HRCT chest confirmed a pattern of Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP) consistent with RA-ILD. Management required a multidisciplinary approach, involving a switch from Methotrexate to Mycophenolate Mofetil and referral for pulmonary rehabilitation.

rheumatoid_arthritis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Felty's Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent skin infections and left upper quadrant discomfort.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female with a 20-year history of erosive RA presented with persistent neutropenia (neutrophils 0.4 x 10^9/L) and splenomegaly on ultrasound. Clinical diagnosis of Felty's syndrome was made based on the triad of RA, splenomegaly, and granulocytopenia. She was treated with Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) and optimisation of her DMARD regimen to reduce infection risk.

rheumatoid_arthritis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic Rheumatoid Arthritis Flare
  presenting_complaint: Severe polyarticular pain and inability to perform activities of daily living.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with known RA presented to A&E following a viral upper respiratory tract infection which triggered a massive disease flare. Her CRP was 120 mg/L and she was unable to weight-bear due to bilateral ankle and knee synovitis. She was admitted for intravenous methylprednisolone pulses and intensive physiotherapy before being discharged on an escalated dose of Leflunomide.

rheumatoid_arthritis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Seronegative Rheumatoid Arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic swelling of the wrists and MTP joints.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male presented with characteristic inflammatory arthritis but repeatedly negative RF and anti-CCP serology. Ultrasound of the hands confirmed active synovitis and power Doppler signals in multiple joints. Despite the seronegativity, the clinical pattern and radiographic evidence of marginal erosions confirmed RA, and he was commenced on triple therapy (Methotrexate, Sulfasalazine, and Hydroxychloroquine).

rheumatoid_arthritis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Rheumatoid Vasculitis
  presenting_complaint: Painful skin ulcers on the lower legs and digital infarcts.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old smoker with long-standing, nodular, seropositive RA presented with necrotic lesions on his fingertips and livedo reticularis. Skin biopsy confirmed small-vessel leucocytoclastic vasculitis associated with RA. Treatment was escalated to high-dose systemic steroids and Rituximab infusions to manage the life-threatening systemic vasculitis.

rheumatoid_arthritis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Atlanto-axial Subluxation in RA
  presenting_complaint: Severe neck pain and paresthesia in the hands.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female with end-stage erosive RA presented with neurological symptoms and "electric shock" sensations upon neck flexion (Lhermitte's sign). Lateral cervical spine X-rays in flexion and extension revealed an atlantodental interval of 7mm. She was urgently referred to neurosurgery for posterior cervical fusion to prevent permanent spinal cord injury.

rheumatoid_arthritis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Rheumatoid Arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent joint pain despite multiple biologic therapies.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female with severe RA failed to achieve remission despite sequential trials of Adalimumab, Abatacept, and Tocilizumab. Her DAS28-CRP remained high at 6.4, with significant functional impairment. Following a multidisciplinary review, she was started on a JAK inhibitor (Upadacitinib), which finally yielded a moderate clinical response and reduction in inflammatory markers.

rheumatoid_arthritis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Palindromic Rheumatism progressing to RA
  presenting_complaint: Episodic, migratory joint swelling lasting 48 hours.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male initially presented with transient episodes of knee and wrist swelling that resolved completely between attacks. Over two years, the episodes became more frequent and began to involve the small joints of the hands persistently. Positive anti-CCP antibodies predicted the eventual transition to established Rheumatoid Arthritis, and early DMARD therapy was initiated.

rheumatoid_arthritis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: AA Amyloidosis secondary to RA
  presenting_complaint: New-onset peripheral oedema and heavy proteinuria.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with a 30-year history of untreated RA presented with nephrotic-range proteinuria (8g/24h). Renal biopsy showed Congo red-positive deposits that demonstrated AA-type amyloid immunofluorescence. Management focused on aggressive suppression of the underlying RA inflammation to prevent further renal decline, although the prognosis remained guarded.

rheumatoid_arthritis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Rheumatoid Arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent stiffness in the fingers.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female was diagnosed with mild, non-erosive RA involving only three joints. She had low-titre RF and normal inflammatory markers at baseline. Her disease has remained well-controlled for five years on Hydroxychloroquine monotherapy, with no evidence of joint damage on annual radiographic monitoring.

rheumatoid_arthritis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Septic Arthritis complicating RA
  presenting_complaint: Acute, hot, swollen right knee and fever.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old patient on Adalimumab for RA presented with a single hot joint and systemic malaise. Arthrocentesis revealed purulent fluid with a high white cell count, and cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus. The biologic was suspended, and the patient underwent emergency surgical washout followed by a 6-week course of intravenous flucloxacillin.

rheumatoid_arthritis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: RA with Secondary Sjögren's Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Gritty eyes, dry mouth, and persistent joint aches.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female with established RA reported worsening sicca symptoms. Investigations confirmed reduced tear production (Schirmer's test 3mm) and positive anti-Ro/SSA antibodies. Management included topical ciclosporin for the eyes, pilocarpine for xerostomia, and continuation of her Methotrexate for the articular components of her disease.

rheumatoid_arthritis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic "Burnt-out" Rheumatoid Arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Severe hand deformities and loss of function.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female presented with classic "swan-neck" and "boutonniere" deformities and fixed ulnar deviation. Despite the lack of active synovitis or raised CRP (burnt-out phase), she suffered from significant mechanical pain and disability. Treatment focused on occupational therapy, joint protection, and simple analgesia rather than aggressive immunosuppression.

rheumatoid_arthritis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Early Inflammatory Arthritis (Probable RA)
  presenting_complaint: New onset of hand swelling for 4 weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female presented within the "window of opportunity" with a 4-week history of symmetrical synovitis. While X-rays were normal and serology was pending, the high clinical suspicion of RA led to early referral to the "Early Arthritis Clinic." Immediate initiation of DMARDs was planned to prevent the development of permanent joint erosions.

rheumatoid_arthritis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Methotrexate-induced Hepatotoxicity in RA
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic rise in liver enzymes during routine monitoring.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with RA on 20mg Methotrexate weekly was found to have an ALT of 145 U/L and AST of 110 U/L on routine bloods. He had no symptoms of jaundice or abdominal pain, but his alcohol intake was noted to be 25 units per week. Methotrexate was withheld until enzymes normalised, and he was subsequently switched to Leflunomide with strict alcohol abstinence advice.

rheumatoid_arthritis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Caplan's Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Routine chest X-ray showing multiple lung nodules.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old retired coal miner with seropositive RA underwent a chest X-ray for an unrelated cough, which revealed multiple well-defined peripheral pulmonary nodules. Biopsy and history confirmed Caplan's syndrome (rheumatoid pneumoconiosis). His RA was managed with Sulfasalazine, and he was monitored with serial imaging to differentiate the nodules from malignancy.

rheumatoid_arthritis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Ruptured Baker's Cyst in RA
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of calf pain and swelling mimicking DVT.
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old male with an active RA flare in his right knee experienced sudden, sharp pain in his calf followed by swelling and erythema. A DVT was ruled out by Doppler ultrasound, which instead showed a ruptured popliteal (Baker's) cyst with fluid tracking down the fascial planes. He was treated with an intra-articular steroid injection to the knee and limb elevation.
