  primary_diagnosis: Severe chronic mitral insufficiency (Barlow's disease)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive exertional dyspnoea (NYHA Class III) and palpitations.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female with known mitral valve prolapse (MVP) reported worsening exercise tolerance over six months. TTE showed bileaflet prolapse, chordal elongation, and severe holosystolic regurgitation with a dilated left atrium (LA). She was referred for elective mitral valve repair (mitral valvuloplasty) given the high likelihood of successful repair.

mitral_insufficiency_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary (functional) mitral insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, and bilateral ankle swelling.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with ischaemic cardiomyopathy and an LV ejection fraction of 25% presented with decompensated heart failure. TTE demonstrated a central regurgitant jet caused by restricted leaflet motion (Carpentier Type IIIb) due to LV remodeling and annular dilatation. Management involved optimising UK-standard heart failure medications (ARNI, SGLT2i, and beta-blockers) with moderate symptomatic improvement.

mitral_insufficiency_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic rheumatic mitral insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female, originally from a region with endemic rheumatic fever, presented with chronic fatigue. Investigations revealed thickened mitral valve leaflets with "hockey-stick" deformity and significant regurgitation alongside mild stenosis. She was commenced on diuretics and penicillin prophylaxis, with plans for future valve intervention.

mitral_insufficiency_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute infective endocarditis with mitral insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: High fever, rigors, and a new-onset heart murmur.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use presented with sepsis. Blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus, and transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) showed a 1.2cm vegetation on the anterior mitral leaflet causing leaflet perforation and acute severe MR. He required a six-week course of IV antibiotics and urgent surgical valve repair.

mitral_insufficiency_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Congenital mitral insufficiency (Cleft Mitral Valve)
  presenting_complaint: Poor feeding, failure to thrive, and tachypnoea in infancy.
  summary_of_course: An 8-month-old infant was referred to paediatric cardiology for persistent respiratory distress. Imaging identified an isolated cleft in the anterior mitral leaflet causing severe regurgitation without an associated atrioventricular septal defect. The infant underwent successful surgical cleft closure and is meeting developmental milestones.

mitral_insufficiency_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Atrial functional mitral insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Persistent palpitations and mild breathlessness.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old female with long-standing permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) presented with worsening NYHA Class II symptoms. TTE showed significant LA dilatation and mitral annular enlargement leading to malcoaptation of otherwise normal leaflets. Symptoms were managed with aggressive rate control and diuretics, as she was not a candidate for invasive intervention.

mitral_insufficiency_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic mitral insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly worsening breathlessness precipitated by new-onset atrial fibrillation.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with known moderate chronic MR presented to A&E in fast AF (heart rate 150 bpm). The loss of atrial kick and rapid rate led to acute pulmonary congestion; TTE confirmed the MR had worsened to severe due to tachycardia-induced changes. Symptoms stabilised following successful DC cardioversion and restoration of sinus rhythm.

mitral_insufficiency_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent mitral insufficiency post-percutaneous repair
  presenting_complaint: Return of congestive heart failure symptoms 12 months after MitraClip procedure.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male, previously treated with a MitraClip for degenerative MR due to high surgical risk, presented with recurrent orthopnoea. Repeat TTE showed partial detachment of one clip (single leaflet device attachment) resulting in severe residual MR. He was managed medically with increased diuretics as further intervention was deemed high-risk.

mitral_insufficiency_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe mitral insufficiency with secondary pulmonary hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Right-sided heart failure symptoms including ascites and peripheral oedema.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female with untreated severe MR presented with signs of right heart strain. Right heart catheterisation confirmed a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 65 mmHg, secondary to long-standing left-sided valvular disease. Following a period of diuresis, she underwent successful MVR, which led to a gradual reduction in pulmonary pressures over six months.

mitral_insufficiency_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Radiation-induced mitral insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Dyspnoea on exertion and chest tightness.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female, who received mediastinal radiotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma 20 years prior, presented with progressive valvular dysfunction. Imaging showed heavy calcification of the mitral annulus and subvalvular apparatus causing restrictive motion and severe MR. Due to the "porcelain" nature of the tissues, she was referred for specialised cardiothoracic surgical assessment.

mitral_insufficiency_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Mitral insufficiency in Marfan Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Chest wall deformity and exertional palpitations.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male with Marfan Syndrome was found to have significant mitral valve prolapse on screening. TTE revealed elongated chordae tendineae and a dilated mitral annulus causing severe MR, alongside a 4.2cm aortic root. He was started on Losartan and scheduled for prophylactic mitral valve repair to prevent LV dysfunction.

mitral_insufficiency_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Traumatic mitral insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Acute chest pain and respiratory distress following a road traffic accident.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male suffered blunt chest trauma during a high-speed collision. Post-accident assessment revealed a new systolic murmur; TTE confirmed traumatic rupture of the chordae tendineae of the anterior mitral leaflet. He underwent urgent surgical repair of the valve and has since made a full recovery.

mitral_insufficiency_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Physiological (Trace) mitral insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic; detected during screening for competitive sports.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old elite marathon runner underwent an ECG and TTE as part of a sports fellowship. TTE showed a trace amount of mitral regurgitation with normal valve morphology and no chamber enlargement. This was documented as a physiological finding common in athletes, requiring no further treatment or restrictions.

mitral_insufficiency_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe mitral insufficiency in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Acute breathlessness in the third trimester of pregnancy.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female at 28 weeks gestation, with a history of mild MVP, developed acute pulmonary oedema. The physiological increase in blood volume during pregnancy exacerbated her underlying valve disease, leading to severe MR. She was managed with bed rest, nitrates, and hydralazine, eventually undergoing a planned Caesarean section followed by postpartum valve repair.

mitral_insufficiency_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Libman-Sacks endocarditis (Mitral insufficiency)
  presenting_complaint: Fever, joint pain, and a malar rash.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) presented with a flare of her condition. Echocardiography identified small, sterile verrucous vegetations on the ventricular surface of the mitral leaflets, causing moderate regurgitation. Management focused on intensive immunosuppression for her SLE, which resulted in the stabilisation of the valvular lesions.

mitral_insufficiency_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Mitral insufficiency secondary to Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)
  presenting_complaint: Exertional syncope and systolic murmur.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male with a family history of sudden cardiac death was diagnosed with obstructive HCM. TTE demonstrated Systolic Anterior Motion (SAM) of the mitral valve, where the anterior leaflet is sucked into the LV outflow tract, causing both obstruction and significant MR. Symptoms improved significantly following the initiation of beta-blockers and disopyramide.

mitral_insufficiency_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Drug-induced mitral insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Progressive breathlessness and dry cough.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female with a historical use of the anorectic agent fenfluramine presented with valvular heart disease. TTE showed "stiff" mitral leaflets with shortened chordae, characteristic of serotonergic drug-induced fibrosis, resulting in moderate MR. She is currently managed medically with serial echocardiograms every 12 months.

mitral_insufficiency_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic mitral insufficiency post-valvuloplasty
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of severe SOB following a cardiac procedure.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with severe mitral stenosis underwent percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy (PTMC). Immediately following balloon inflation, he developed severe MR due to a traumatic tear in the posterior leaflet. The procedure was complicated by acute pulmonary oedema, necessitating urgent transfer for surgical mitral valve replacement.
