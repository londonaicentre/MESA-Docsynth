  presenting_complaint: Intermittent blanching and numbness of fingers in cold weather.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female presents to her GP with a two-year history of symmetrical, triphasic colour changes (white, blue, red) in her fingers when exposed to cold. Physical examination and nailfold capillaroscopy are normal, and ANA screening is negative. She is diagnosed with primary Raynaud's, advised on lifestyle modifications and smoking cessation, and remains well-managed without medication.

raynauds_syndrome_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary Raynaud's phenomenon associated with Systemic Sclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Painful digital ulceration and severe cold sensitivity.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with known limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis presents with a non-healing ulcer on the tip of her right index finger. Examination reveals sclerodactyly, telangiectasia, and abnormal nailfold capillaries with "giant" loops. She is started on a course of oral nifedipine and topical glyceryl trinitrate, with subsequent referral to a specialist rheumatology centre for consideration of IV Iloprost.

raynauds_syndrome_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Vibration White Finger (Occupational Raynaud's)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic numbness and blanching of the fingers, worse in the mornings.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male construction worker with 20 years of exposure to pneumatic drills reports progressive episodic whitening of his digits. Symptoms are most severe in his dominant hand and are associated with reduced grip strength and paraesthesia. He is diagnosed with Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome (HAVS) and advised to cease use of vibratory tools, with symptoms showing partial improvement after six months of avoidance.

raynauds_syndrome_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Drug-induced Raynaud's phenomenon
  presenting_complaint: New onset of cold, blue fingers since starting new medication.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male recently started on Propranolol for migraine prophylaxis develops bilateral finger discolouration and coldness. He has no prior history of vasospastic disorders or connective tissue disease. The beta-blocker is discontinued and replaced with Topiramate, leading to a complete resolution of the Raynaud's symptoms within two weeks.

raynauds_syndrome_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)
  presenting_complaint: Blue fingers accompanied by joint pain and a facial rash.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female presents with Raynaud's symptoms, polyarthritis of the small joints, and a malar rash. Serology reveals a high-titre ANA (1:1280, speckled pattern) and positive anti-dsDNA antibodies. She is diagnosed with SLE and started on Hydroxychloroquine and low-dose Prednisolone, which improves both her systemic symptoms and the frequency of vasospastic episodes.

raynauds_syndrome_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Critical digital ischaemia in secondary Raynaud's
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, excruciating pain and blackening of the third left digit.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female with a history of CREST syndrome presents to A&E with acute-on-chronic digital ischaemia. Examination shows a cyanotic, cold finger with absent capillary refill and early gangrenous changes. She is admitted for urgent IV Iloprost infusion, heparinisation, and surgical consultation, narrowly avoiding amputation after successful vasodilation.

raynauds_syndrome_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Primary Raynaud's
  presenting_complaint: Hands turning "ghostly white" during school PE lessons.
  summary_of_course: An 11-year-old girl is brought by her parents after her fingers turned white and then purple during outdoor netball. There is no family history of autoimmune disease and her growth is normal. Following a normal clinical examination and negative inflammatory markers, she is diagnosed with primary Raynaud's and provided with silver-threaded gloves for school use.

raynauds_syndrome_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to Sjögren's Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Cold-induced finger pain associated with severe dry eyes and mouth.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female presents with a 5-year history of Raynaud's and progressive sicca symptoms. Investigations confirm positive anti-Ro (SS-A) and anti-La (SS-B) antibodies and a positive Schirmer's test. Management focuses on both the underlying Sjögren's and symptomatic control of Raynaud's using Amlodipine, which the patient tolerates well.

raynauds_syndrome_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Paraneoplastic Raynaud's phenomenon
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of severe Raynaud's in an elderly patient.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with a 40-pack-year smoking history develops rapid-onset, severe Raynaud's and 10kg weight loss over three months. Unlike primary Raynaud's, his symptoms are asymmetrical and resistant to vasodilators. A CT chest reveals a suspicious mass in the left upper lobe, later confirmed as squamous cell lung carcinoma, suggesting a paraneoplastic origin for his vasospasm.

raynauds_syndrome_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Raynaud's phenomenon in Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD)
  presenting_complaint: Swollen "sausage" fingers and Raynaud's symptoms.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female presents with Raynaud's, dactylitis, and proximal muscle weakness. Laboratory testing shows a very high titre of anti-U1 RNP antibodies, confirming MCTD. She is treated with a combination of Sildenafil for her Raynaud's and Methotrexate for her inflammatory arthritis, resulting in significant functional improvement.

raynauds_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Raynaud's with digital gangrene
  presenting_complaint: Persistent blackening of the fingertips despite multiple medications.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with diffuse systemic sclerosis suffers from recurrent digital ulcers that have progressed to dry gangrene of the right thumb. She has failed treatment with Nifedipine, Losartan, and Sildenafil. She is admitted for a 5-day course of IV Iloprost and started on Bosentan (an endothelin receptor antagonist) to prevent further ulcer formation.

raynauds_syndrome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary Raynaud's in a male patient
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent blue discolouration of fingers while walking the dog.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male presents with classic Raynaud's symptoms but is concerned about underlying disease due to his gender. Physical examination is unremarkable, and all autoimmune screening (ANA, ENA, ESR) is negative. He is reassured that while less common in men, it can be primary, and he manages well with heated hand warmers and smoking cessation.

raynauds_syndrome_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's Disease) presenting as Raynaud's
  presenting_complaint: Cold, painful fingers and toes with calf pain on walking.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male heavy smoker presents with Raynaud's-like symptoms and intermittent claudication. Angiography shows "corkscrew" collaterals and distal arterial occlusions. He is diagnosed with Buerger's disease and told that absolute smoking cessation is the only way to prevent progressive ischaemia and potential amputation; he is referred to a smoking cessation clinic.

raynauds_syndrome_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Treatment-resistant Raynaud's phenomenon
  presenting_complaint: Severe, frequent Raynaud's attacks despite maximum dose Nifedipine.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female with primary Raynaud's finds her symptoms are no longer controlled by 60mg of Nifedipine MR daily. She experiences significant side effects including peripheral oedema and flushing. Her treatment is switched to Sildenafil 25mg three times daily, which provides better symptom control with fewer adverse effects.

raynauds_syndrome_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to Dermatomyositis
  presenting_complaint: Blue fingers, "mechanic's hands", and difficulty climbing stairs.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female presents with Raynaud's, hyperkeratotic skin changes on the palms, and proximal limb weakness. Bloods show a significantly raised Creatine Kinase (CK) and positive anti-Jo-1 antibodies. She is diagnosed with Dermatomyositis (Antisynthetase Syndrome) and started on high-dose corticosteroids and Azathioprine, which stabilises her muscle strength and improves her peripheral circulation.

raynauds_syndrome_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Cryoglobulinaemia-associated Raynaud's
  presenting_complaint: Cold-induced purpura and Raynaud's symptoms.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C presents with Raynaud's and a palpable purpuric rash on his lower limbs triggered by cold. Laboratory tests confirm the presence of Type II mixed cryoglobulins and low C4 complement levels. Treatment of the underlying Hepatitis C with direct-acting antivirals leads to the resolution of his cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis and Raynaud's.

raynauds_syndrome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Raynaud's phenomenon with associated Perniosis (Chilblains)
  presenting_complaint: Itchy, painful purple lumps on the toes and fingers in winter.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female student presents with classic Raynaud's symptoms and recurrent, painful, erythematous nodules on her dorsal digits during the winter months. She is diagnosed with Raynaud's and secondary perniosis. She is advised on keeping her core temperature warm and is prescribed topical betamethasone valerate for the acute inflammatory lesions.

raynauds_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary Raynaud's in Rheumatoid Arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Worsening finger coldness in a patient with long-standing joint deformities.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female with a 20-year history of erosive Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) develops new-onset Raynaud's symptoms. While her RA is well-controlled on Methotrexate and Etanercept, the vasospasm is thought to be secondary to underlying small-vessel vasculopathy. She is started on a low-dose ACE inhibitor (Lisinopril) which provides symptomatic relief for her vasospastic episodes.

raynauds_syndrome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Pregnancy-exacerbated Raynaud's phenomenon
  presenting_complaint: Frequent, painful Raynaud's attacks during the first trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female with known primary Raynaud's reports a significant increase in the frequency and severity of attacks since becoming pregnant. Due to the pregnancy, standard vasodilators like Nifedipine are used with caution; she is managed conservatively with thermal clothing and avoidance of cold triggers, with symptoms naturally improving during the second trimester due to physiological vasodilation.

raynauds_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Atherosclerosis-related secondary Raynaud's
  presenting_complaint: Cold-induced ischaemia in an elderly patient with vascular disease.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with known peripheral vascular disease and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) presents with new-onset Raynaud's symptoms in his right hand. Doppler ultrasound reveals significant ulnar artery stenosis. He is managed with antiplatelet therapy and statins, and his Raynaud's is treated as a manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis rather than a primary vasospastic disorder.
