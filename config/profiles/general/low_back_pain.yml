  presenting_complaint: Mid-to-low back pain and a visible "hunchback" deformity.
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old male presented with thoracic-lumbar pain that worsened with activity. X-rays demonstrated anterior wedging of three contiguous vertebrae and Schmorl's nodes. Because his kyphosis angle was 65 degrees, he was treated with a combination of a Milwaukee brace and a specialized exercise programme.
