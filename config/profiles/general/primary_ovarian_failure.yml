primary_ovarian_failure_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Turner Syndrome (45,X/46,XX Mosaicism)
  presenting_complaint: Primary amenorrhoea and short stature.
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old female presented with failure to achieve menarche and height below the 3rd centile. Karyotyping confirmed mosaic Turner syndrome, while biochemistry showed FSH 88 IU/L and oestradiol <50 pmol/L. She was commenced on a graduated oestrogen replacement regimen to induce secondary sexual characteristics and protect bone density.

primary_ovarian_failure_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic Premature Ovarian Insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Secondary amenorrhoea for 12 months and night sweats.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old previously healthy woman reported sudden cessation of menses following a period of high stress. Serial FSH levels were 42 IU/L and 48 IU/L measured six weeks apart, with undetectable AMH levels. She was diagnosed with idiopathic POI and started on sequential combined HRT, resulting in significant improvement in vasomotor symptoms.

primary_ovarian_failure_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic Primary Ovarian Failure
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset hot flushes and vaginal dryness post-chemotherapy.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old woman underwent gonadotoxic chemotherapy (ABVD) for Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Following treatment, she experienced immediate menopause symptoms and elevated gonadotrophins (FSH 110 IU/L). Management involved topical oestrogen for atrophic vaginitis and systemic HRT, with ongoing monitoring for long-term cardiovascular health.

primary_ovarian_failure_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Fragile X Premutation-Associated POI
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty conceiving and irregular cycles.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old woman presented to a fertility clinic with a 2-year history of primary infertility and oligomenorrhoea. Genetic screening identified an FMR1 premutation (80 CGG repeats), and pelvic ultrasound showed low antral follicle counts. She was counselled regarding the low probability of spontaneous conception and referred for egg donation options.

primary_ovarian_failure_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Autoimmune Oophoritis (APS Type 2)
  presenting_complaint: Amenorrhoea, fatigue, and skin hyperpigmentation.
  summary_of_course: A 37-year-old woman with known Addison’s disease presented with secondary amenorrhoea. Investigations revealed positive anti-adrenal and anti-ovarian antibodies, with FSH 65 IU/L. This confirmed autoimmune-mediated primary ovarian failure as part of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2, requiring coordinated management of steroid and hormone replacement.

primary_ovarian_failure_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Classic Turner Syndrome (45,X)
  presenting_complaint: Delayed puberty and webbed neck.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old girl was referred for lack of breast development. Clinical examination noted a low posterior hairline and cubitus valgus; ultrasound confirmed streak ovaries. Growth hormone therapy was initiated followed by low-dose oestrogen to mimic physiological puberty.

primary_ovarian_failure_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Surgical Menopause
  presenting_complaint: Severe, life-threatening vasomotor symptoms and mood instability.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old woman underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for stage IV endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain. Postoperatively, she developed acute, severe surgical menopause with suicidal ideation due to sleep deprivation from constant hot flushes. She required urgent stabilisation with high-dose transdermal oestradiol and psychological support.

primary_ovarian_failure_008:
  primary_diagnosis: POI-related Osteoporosis
  presenting_complaint: Low-trauma wrist fracture.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old woman presented to A&E with a Colles' fracture after a minor fall. Retrospective history revealed she had been amenorrhoeic since age 31 but never sought medical advice. DXA scan showed a T-score of -2.8 at the lumbar spine, and she was started on HRT and bisphosphonates for severe bone density loss.

primary_ovarian_failure_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Galactosemia-associated Ovarian Failure
  presenting_complaint: Primary amenorrhoea in a paediatric patient.
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old girl with a known diagnosis of classic galactosemia since birth presented with failure of pubertal progression. Despite strict dietary control, she developed hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (FSH 95 IU/L) due to direct follicular toxicity of galactose metabolites. Oestrogen replacement was initiated to support skeletal maturation.

primary_ovarian_failure_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Autoimmune POI with Type 1 Diabetes
  presenting_complaint: Secondary amenorrhoea and erratic blood glucose control.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old woman with Type 1 Diabetes and Coeliac disease reported loss of periods for 9 months. Biochemistry confirmed POI (FSH 55 IU/L, LH 30 IU/L), likely autoimmune in origin. The hormonal shift had caused significant instability in her glycaemic control, requiring insulin pump adjustment alongside HRT initiation.

primary_ovarian_failure_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Resistant Ovary Syndrome (Savage Syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Infertility and high FSH.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old woman presented with secondary amenorrhoea and FSH levels >100 IU/L. Unusually, transvaginal ultrasound showed numerous primordial follicles, and ovarian biopsy confirmed the presence of oocytes but lack of gonadotrophin receptors. She was diagnosed with Resistant Ovary Syndrome and commenced on HRT for symptom management.

primary_ovarian_failure_012:
  primary_diagnosis: POI with Treatment Failure (HRT Intolerance)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent hot flushes and migraine with aura.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old woman with idiopathic POI was unable to tolerate standard oral HRT due to exacerbation of migraines with aura and a previous VTE. Management was challenging; she was eventually stabilised on low-dose transdermal oestradiol patches and a levonorgestrel intrauterine system (Mirena) to provide endometrial protection with minimal systemic progestogen side effects.

primary_ovarian_failure_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Radiation-Induced Ovarian Failure
  presenting_complaint: Menopausal symptoms following pelvic radiotherapy.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old woman treated for Ewing sarcoma of the pelvis received high-dose radiotherapy. Despite ovarian transposition prior to treatment, she developed POI within six months (FSH 78 IU/L). She was commenced on HRT to prevent early-onset cardiovascular disease and maintain bone health.

primary_ovarian_failure_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic POI with Cognitive Impairment
  presenting_complaint: Severe "brain fog", memory loss, and insomnia.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old executive presented with cognitive difficulties initially misdiagnosed as burnout or early-onset dementia. Further history revealed oligomenorrhoea and FSH 50 IU/L. Initiation of transdermal oestrogen and micronised progesterone led to a complete resolution of cognitive symptoms within three months.

primary_ovarian_failure_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Swyer Syndrome (46,XY DSD)
  presenting_complaint: Primary amenorrhoea and tall stature.
  summary_of_course: A 17-year-old girl presented with failure of breast development. Genetic testing revealed a 46,XY karyotype with a mutation in the SRY gene, and imaging showed streak gonads. Due to the high risk of gonadoblastoma, she underwent prophylactic gonadectomy followed by HRT to induce feminisation.

primary_ovarian_failure_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic POI (Waning Reserve)
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent flushes and erratic heavy bleeding.
  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old woman experienced 18 months of "waning" ovarian function with fluctuating FSH levels (ranging from 15 to 45 IU/L). She presented acutely with heavy flooding and severe vasomotor instability during a period of sustained high FSH. She was managed with a high-dose combined oral contraceptive pill to stabilise the endometrium and suppress symptoms.

primary_ovarian_failure_017:
  primary_diagnosis: POI with Severe Urogenital Atrophy
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent UTIs and severe dyspareunia.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old woman presented with a 2-year history of painful intercourse and frequent urinary tract infections. Investigations revealed undetectable oestradiol and FSH 70 IU/L. Treatment included systemic HRT and long-term local vaginal oestrogen cream, which successfully restored mucosal integrity and stopped the infection cycle.

primary_ovarian_failure_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic POI (Subacute Presentation)
  presenting_complaint: Anxiety and palpitations.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old woman was referred to cardiology for palpitations; however, ECG and Holter monitoring were normal. A thorough history identified concurrent amenorrhoea, and biochemistry showed FSH 62 IU/L. Her "panic attacks" were found to be vasomotor symptoms, which resolved completely upon starting HRT.

primary_ovarian_failure_019:
  primary_diagnosis: POI with Early-Onset Cardiovascular Disease
  presenting_complaint: Chest pain on exertion (Angina).
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old woman with a history of untreated POI since age 28 presented with stable angina. Coronary angiography showed premature atherosclerotic changes. Her management included aggressive lipid-lowering therapy and late-start HRT, though the primary focus shifted to secondary prevention of myocardial infarction.

primary_ovarian_failure_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-Infectious Ovarian Failure (Mumps Oophoritis)
  presenting_complaint: Acute pelvic pain followed by amenorrhoea.
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old woman developed bilateral oophoritis during a mumps outbreak. Following the acute illness, her menstrual cycles did not return, and FSH was found to be 90 IU/L. She was diagnosed with permanent ovarian damage and started on HRT, with psychological referral for support regarding her sudden loss of fertility.
