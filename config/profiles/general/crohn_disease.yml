crohn_disease_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild terminal ileal Crohn's disease
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent right lower quadrant pain and non-bloody diarrhoea.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male presented with a 4-month history of cramping abdominal pain and three loose stools daily. Bloods revealed a mildly raised CRP of 12 mg/L and faecal calprotectin of 450 µg/g. Colonoscopy confirmed aphthous ulceration in the terminal ileum with histology showing non-caseating granulomas. He was successfully managed with a course of oral budesonide and remains in clinical remission on azathioprine.

crohn_disease_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe fistulising perianal Crohn's disease
  presenting_complaint: Severe perianal pain and purulent discharge.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female with known colonic Crohn's presented with excruciating pain and discharge from the perineum. Pelvic MRI identified a complex trans-sphincteric fistula with a 3cm associated abscess. Following surgical incision and drainage with seton placement, she commenced dual therapy with Infliximab and methotrexate, leading to significant symptomatic improvement.

crohn_disease_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Stricturing Crohn's disease with subacute obstruction
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent post-prandial bloating, vomiting, and weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented to A&E with abdominal distension and inability to tolerate solids. CT enterography demonstrated a 10cm fibrotic stricture in the distal ileum with proximal bowel dilatation. Despite IV hydrocortisone, the obstruction failed to resolve, necessitating an elective laparoscopic ileocaecal resection and primary anastomosis.

crohn_disease_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Crohn's disease with growth failure
  presenting_complaint: Short stature and delayed puberty.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy was referred by his GP for failure to thrive, being below the 2nd centile for height. He reported occasional vague abdominal discomfort but no diarrhoea; however, bloods showed microcytic anaemia and an ESR of 40 mm/hr. Endoscopy revealed extensive small bowel Crohn's disease, and he was started on exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) which achieved both mucosal healing and a significant growth spurt.

crohn_disease_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute severe Crohn's colitis
  presenting_complaint: Bloody diarrhoea (12 episodes/day) and nocturnal stools.
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old female presented with a two-week history of worsening haematochezia and urgency. On admission, she was tachycardic with a CRP of 95 mg/L and albumin of 26 g/L. Flexible sigmoidoscopy showed deep "snake-like" ulceration consistent with severe Crohn's colitis, requiring IV methylprednisolone and subsequent rescue therapy with Infliximab.

crohn_disease_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Crohn's disease with Pyoderma Gangrenosum
  presenting_complaint: Painful, rapidly enlarging ulcer on the left pretibial area.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male with a history of quiescent Crohn's presented with a necrotic, violaceous-edged ulcer on his shin. Skin biopsy and clinical appearance confirmed pyoderma gangrenosum as an extra-intestinal manifestation of a subclinical Crohn's flare. His systemic immunosuppression was escalated to Adalimumab, resulting in both skin healing and bowel stabilisation.

crohn_disease_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Gastroduodenal Crohn's disease
  presenting_complaint: Persistent epigastric pain and early satiety.
  summary_of_course: An 18-year-old female presented with symptoms mimicking refractory peptic ulcer disease. OGD revealed a "bamboo-joint" appearance of the gastric body and multiple longitudinal ulcers in the duodenum. Biopsies confirmed granulomatous inflammation, and she was started on a proton pump inhibitor alongside Vedolizumab for upper GI Crohn's involvement.

crohn_disease_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Crohn's disease with intra-abdominal abscess
  presenting_complaint: High fever, rigors, and a palpable right iliac fossa mass.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male with long-standing ileal Crohn's presented acutely unwell with systemic inflammatory response syndrome. CT imaging identified a 6cm psoas abscess secondary to a micro-perforation of the terminal ileum. He underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage and a 6-week course of IV antibiotics before transitioning to Ustekinumab.

crohn_disease_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Elderly-onset Crohn's colitis
  presenting_complaint: Tenesmus and weight loss in a 75-year-old.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female was initially investigated for suspected colorectal malignancy due to a positive FIT and weight loss. Colonoscopy showed patchy, segmental inflammation in the descending colon with rectal sparing, and histology confirmed Crohn's disease. She was managed conservatively with mesalazine and remains stable, highlighting the diagnostic challenge of IBD in the elderly.

crohn_disease_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Metastatic cutaneous Crohn's disease
  presenting_complaint: Chronic erythematous plaques in the skin folds of the groin.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male with known ileocaecal Crohn's presented with non-healing, painful skin lesions in the inguinal region. Histopathology of the skin showed non-caseating granulomas identical to his previous bowel biopsies, confirming metastatic Crohn's. His symptoms responded well to an increase in his dose of subcutaneous methotrexate.

crohn_disease_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Crohn's disease (Treatment failure)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent diarrhoea and abdominal pain despite multiple therapies.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female failed sequential trials of Infliximab, Adalimumab, and Vedolizumab over a five-year period. Her disease remained endoscopically active with deep colonic ulcers and a faecal calprotectin consistently above 1000 µg/g. She was eventually enrolled in a clinical trial for a novel JAK inhibitor, which finally achieved clinical response.

crohn_disease_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Crohn's disease with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC)
  presenting_complaint: Pruritus and deranged liver function tests.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male with a 10-year history of Crohn's colitis presented with an obstructive jaundice pattern (ALP 450 U/L). MRCP demonstrated "beading" of the intrahepatic bile ducts consistent with PSC. He now undergoes annual surveillance colonoscopies due to the significantly increased risk of colorectal neoplasia associated with this comorbidity.

crohn_disease_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic Crohn's with Toxic Megacolon
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal pain, distension, and mental confusion.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with neglected Crohn's disease presented in septic shock. An abdominal X-ray showed a transverse colon diameter of 8cm with evidence of mucosal islands. Despite aggressive resuscitation and IV steroids, he deteriorated further and underwent an emergency subtotal colectomy and end-ileostomy for life-threatening toxic megacolon.

crohn_disease_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-operative recurrence of Crohn's disease
  presenting_complaint: Recurrence of mild diarrhoea 18 months post-resection.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old male underwent an ileocaecal resection for stricturing disease. A surveillance colonoscopy performed at 18 months post-op showed a Rutgeerts score of i3 (multiple aphthous ulcers in the neo-terminal ileum). Although he was minimally symptomatic, his maintenance therapy was escalated from mesalazine to azathioprine to prevent further clinical relapse.

crohn_disease_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Orofacial granulomatosis (Oral Crohn's)
  presenting_complaint: Swollen lips and painful "cobblestone" mouth ulcers.
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old girl presented to dental services with persistent lip swelling and deep linear ulcers in the buccal sulcus. A subsequent GI review and capsule endoscopy identified skip lesions in the mid-jejunum. She was diagnosed with Crohn's disease with oral involvement and responded well to a combination of topical steroids and systemic Infliximab.

crohn_disease_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Crohn's disease with Enteropathic Arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Large joint swelling (knees and ankles) and back pain.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male presented with migratory polyarthritis alongside active GI symptoms. HLA-B27 testing was negative, but MRI of the sacroiliac joints showed sacroiliitis (Type II enteropathic arthritis). His joint symptoms mirrored his bowel activity, and both improved significantly following the initiation of Adalimumab therapy.

crohn_disease_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Fistulising Crohn's with Enterocutaneous fistula
  presenting_complaint: Faeculent drainage from a previous surgical scar.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female presented three months after an appendicectomy with a discharging sinus on her abdominal wall. Imaging confirmed an enterocutaneous fistula originating from the terminal ileum, which was found to be affected by undiagnosed Crohn's disease. She required a period of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and Infliximab to achieve fistula closure.

crohn_disease_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Crohn's disease with B12 deficiency anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Profound fatigue, paraesthesia, and a sore tongue.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male presented with macrocytic anaemia (Hb 92 g/L, MCV 110 fL) and low B12 levels. Investigation into the cause of malabsorption via small bowel MRI showed 30cm of active inflammation in the terminal ileum. He was diagnosed with Crohn's disease and requires lifelong B12 injections alongside immunosuppressive therapy for his bowel disease.

crohn_disease_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic Crohn's disease (Incidental finding)
  presenting_complaint: Positive faecal immunochemical test (FIT) during routine screening.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old asymptomatic male was referred for colonoscopy following a FIT result of 150 µg/g. The procedure revealed moderate ulceration in the caecum and terminal ileum with normal histology elsewhere. Despite the lack of symptoms, his high risk of progression led to the initiation of prophylactic azathioprine and regular monitoring of faecal calprotectin.

crohn_disease_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Crohn's disease flare in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Increased stool frequency and weight loss at 22 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old pregnant female with known Crohn's experienced a moderate flare during her second trimester. Management was coordinated between gastroenterology and obstetrics, utilizing oral prednisolone to induce remission. She continued her Infliximab throughout the pregnancy (with a planned gap before delivery) to ensure maternal health and prevent adverse foetal outcomes.
