  primary_diagnosis: End-stage knee osteoarthritis
  presenting_complaint: Severe right knee pain and reduced walking distance.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with a BMI of 34 presented with chronic right knee pain that now disturbs his sleep. Clinical examination showed fixed flexion deformity and crepitus, while X-rays demonstrated "bone-on-bone" medial compartment collapse and large osteophytes. He was referred for elective total knee replacement (TKR) after failing conservative management with physiotherapy and intra-articular steroid injections.

osteoarthritis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-traumatic ankle osteoarthritis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent left ankle pain and stiffness following a previous fracture.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old former rugby player presented with a 2-year history of worsening ankle pain, ten years after a trimalleolar fracture. Imaging showed significant narrowing of the tibiotalar joint space with subchondral cysts. He was managed with a rocker-bottom sole modification and referred to orthopaedics for consideration of ankle arthrodesis.

osteoarthritis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Erosive hand osteoarthritis
  presenting_complaint: Acute flares of painful, red, and swollen finger joints.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female presented with subacute, inflammatory-style episodes affecting her interphalangeal joints. Radiography showed characteristic "gull-wing" deformities and central erosions, distinguishing it from rheumatoid arthritis via negative CCP and RF serology. Treatment involved short courses of oral NSAIDs and paraffin wax baths for symptomatic relief.

osteoarthritis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Lumbar spondylosis with neurogenic claudication
  presenting_complaint: Lower back pain and leg heaviness brought on by walking.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male reported bilateral leg pain that improves when leaning forward on a shopping trolley. MRI of the lumbar spine revealed severe multilevel facet joint osteoarthritis and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy causing spinal stenosis. He was managed with a combination of neuropathic analgesia and a targeted physiotherapy programme, with surgical decompression held in reserve.

osteoarthritis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary osteoarthritis due to obesity
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral mechanical knee pain and difficulty climbing stairs.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with a BMI of 42 and metabolic syndrome presented with progressive bilateral knee discomfort. X-rays showed early degenerative changes in the medial compartments bilaterally. Management focused on a multidisciplinary weight loss programme and low-impact exercise, resulting in significant functional improvement over 12 months.

osteoarthritis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Rapidly progressive hip osteoarthritis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, debilitating right groin pain and inability to bear weight.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female experienced a rapid decline in mobility over just four months. Serial X-rays showed more than 2mm of joint space loss within the timeframe and flattening of the femoral head. She underwent urgent total hip arthroplasty to restore function and prevent further bone loss.

osteoarthritis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Glenohumeral osteoarthritis
  presenting_complaint: Deep shoulder pain and restricted overhead reaching.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old retired carpenter presented with a long-term "grinding" sensation in his dominant shoulder. Examination showed global restriction of passive and active range of motion, particularly external rotation. X-rays confirmed glenohumeral joint space narrowing and a large inferior humeral osteophyte, managed initially with subacromial injections.

osteoarthritis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Hallux rigidus (1st MTPJ osteoarthritis)
  presenting_complaint: Pain at the base of the big toe when walking.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female distance runner reported increasing difficulty with the "toe-off" phase of her gait. Examination revealed limited dorsiflexion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint and a palpable dorsal osteophyte. She was treated with stiff-soled orthotics and eventually underwent a cheilectomy to remove the bony impingement.

osteoarthritis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Osteoarthritis with superimposed septic arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Acute-on-chronic knee pain with fever and rigors.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with known moderate knee OA presented to A&E with a 24-hour history of a hot, exquisitely tender joint. Joint aspiration revealed a white cell count of 80,000/mm³ and Staphylococcus aureus on Gram stain. He required emergency arthroscopic washout and a prolonged course of intravenous flucloxacillin.

osteoarthritis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary osteoarthritis due to hip dysplasia
  presenting_complaint: Chronic left hip aching in a young adult.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female was diagnosed with secondary OA following a childhood history of treated developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). Radiographs showed shallow acetabula and early degenerative changes in the superior labrum. She was managed with hip-strengthening exercises and counselled regarding the high likelihood of requiring arthroplasty in her 40s.

osteoarthritis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Osteoarthritis with ruptured Baker's cyst
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of calf pain and swelling mimicking DVT.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with known knee OA presented with acute posterior leg pain. Ultrasound ruled out deep vein thrombosis but identified a ruptured popliteal cyst with fluid tracking down the gastrocnemius. Symptoms resolved with rest, elevation, and optimization of his underlying osteoarthritis management.

osteoarthritis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Osteoarthritis with NSAID-induced gastropathy
  presenting_complaint: Epigastric pain and melaena.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old female taking high-dose naproxen for chronic hip OA was admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Endoscopy confirmed a gastric ulcer, which was treated with proton pump inhibitors and adrenaline clipping. Her OA medication was switched to topical agents and paracetamol to avoid further systemic COX-inhibition.

osteoarthritis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Haemophilic arthropathy (Secondary OA)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic elbow and ankle stiffness.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male with severe Haemophilia A presented with advanced secondary OA in his elbows and ankles due to recurrent intra-articular bleeds. Despite factor replacement therapy, the joint surfaces were severely degraded. He was managed by a specialist multidisciplinary team focusing on pain control and maintaining joint range of motion.

osteoarthritis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Generalized osteoarthritis with comorbid fibromyalgia
  presenting_complaint: Widespread joint pain and profound fatigue.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female with radiographic OA in her knees and spine presented with pain levels disproportionate to imaging findings. Clinical assessment identified multiple tender points and central sensitisation, leading to a dual diagnosis. Management was adjusted to include duloxetine and hydrotherapy to address both the structural OA and the widespread pain syndrome.

osteoarthritis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Acromegaly-associated osteoarthritis
  presenting_complaint: Coarsening of features and multi-joint aching.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented with unusually severe OA in non-weight-bearing joints and carpal tunnel syndrome. Further investigation revealed elevated IGF-1 and a pituitary adenoma. The secondary OA was managed alongside his endocrine treatment, though structural joint damage remained irreversible.

osteoarthritis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Aseptic loosening of total knee replacement
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent knee pain five years after arthroplasty.
  summary_of_course: A 73-year-old female reported a return of mechanical pain in her prosthetic knee. X-rays and bone scintigraphy showed a lucent line around the tibial component, suggesting aseptic loosening rather than infection. She was scheduled for a revision total knee replacement.

osteoarthritis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Cervical spondylotic myelopathy
  presenting_complaint: Neck pain, clumsy hands, and gait instability.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with long-standing cervical OA developed progressive difficulty with fine motor tasks and a broad-based gait. MRI showed severe disc-osteophyte complexes causing cord compression at C5/C6 with signal change. He underwent urgent cervical decompression and fusion to prevent further neurological deterioration.
