Troponin T levels were significantly elevated at 450 ng/L, though ECG showed only non-specific T-wave inversion. She was managed medically with fondaparinux and nitrates due to her frailty and high surgical risk.

chest_pain_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Cocaine-induced myocardial ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Severe, palpitating chest pain and extreme agitation following recreational drug use.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male was brought in by ambulance with tachycardia and hypertension. ECG showed transient ST-segment changes which resolved after administration of intravenous diazepam. Coronary angiography was performed which showed normal coronary arteries, confirming vasospasm as the primary mechanism.

chest_pain_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Panic disorder
  presenting_complaint: Sharp chest pains, palpitations, and tingling in the fingers during periods of high stress.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female presented multiple times to A&E fearing a heart attack. Extensive cardiac investigations, including 24-hour Holter monitoring and echocardiography, were entirely normal. She was referred to the mental health team for cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for health anxiety.
