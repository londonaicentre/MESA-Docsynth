vitamin_d_deficiency_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Nutritional rickets
  presenting_complaint: Bowed legs and delayed walking
  summary_of_course: A 14-month-old male of African descent presented with significant genu varum and delayed motor milestones. Investigations revealed a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 12 nmol/L, elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and low serum phosphate. Radiographs showed cupping and fraying of the metaphyseal plates, confirming rickets; he was treated with high-dose oral colecalciferol and calcium supplementation with gradual clinical improvement.

vitamin_d_deficiency_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Osteomalacia
  presenting_complaint: Widespread bone pain and waddling gait
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female presented with chronic, dull aching in her hips and lower back, alongside proximal muscle weakness. Laboratory tests showed a 25(OH)D of 18 nmol/L and secondary hyperparathyroidism (PTH 18.5 pmol/L). Pelvic X-rays identified Looser's zones in the femoral neck, leading to a diagnosis of osteomalacia which responded well to an intensive 300,000 IU colecalciferol loading regimen.

vitamin_d_deficiency_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-bariatric malabsorptive vitamin D deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Muscle cramps and paraesthesia
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male, three years post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, presented with acute carpopedal spasms and tingling in his extremities. Bloods confirmed severe hypocalcaemia (adjusted calcium 1.85 mmol/L) and profound vitamin D deficiency (9 nmol/L) due to surgical malabsorption. He required intravenous calcium gluconate followed by permanent high-dose fat-soluble vitamin supplementation.

vitamin_d_deficiency_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary hyperparathyroidism due to CKD-related vitamin D deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Routine monitoring of renal osteodystrophy
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female with Stage 4 Chronic Kidney Disease (eGFR 22) demonstrated rising PTH levels and declining bone mineral density. Her 25(OH)D was found to be 24 nmol/L, complicating her renal mineral bone disorder. She was started on native colecalciferol alongside active alfacalcidol to bypass impaired 1-alpha-hydroxylation in the kidneys.

vitamin_d_deficiency_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild asymptomatic vitamin D insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Generalised fatigue and low mood
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male of South Asian background requested a blood test for persistent lethargy during the winter months in London. Investigations showed a 25(OH)D level of 32 nmol/L with normal calcium and ALP. He was advised on lifestyle modifications, increased UV exposure, and a maintenance dose of 1000 IU colecalciferol daily, resulting in improved energy levels.

vitamin_d_deficiency_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Coeliac-associated vitamin D deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Diarrhoea and iron-deficiency anaemia
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female was investigated for unexplained anaemia and chronic bloating, with subsequent biopsy confirming Coeliac disease. Concomitant screening revealed a 25(OH)D of 15 nmol/L, attributed to small bowel malabsorption. Her vitamin levels normalised only after strict adherence to a gluten-free diet and temporary high-dose oral supplementation.

vitamin_d_deficiency_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Cystic Fibrosis-related fat-soluble vitamin deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent respiratory infections and poor weight gain
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old male with Cystic Fibrosis and pancreatic insufficiency presented with suboptimal growth. Despite standard pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, his 25(OH)D remained persistently low at 20 nmol/L. His treatment was escalated to an aqueous form of vitamin D to enhance absorption, which successfully raised his levels to the target range of >75 nmol/L.

vitamin_d_deficiency_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypocalcaemic seizures secondary to vitamin D deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Generalized tonic-clonic seizure
  summary_of_course: A 4-month-old exclusively breastfed infant was admitted to the paediatric ICU following a first-time seizure. Investigations revealed profound hypocalcaemia (1.60 mmol/L) and a 25(OH)D level below the detectable limit (<5 nmol/L); the mother was also found to be severely deficient. The infant was stabilised with IV calcium and high-dose ergocalciferol.

vitamin_d_deficiency_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe vitamin D deficiency with proximal myopathy
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty rising from a chair and frequent falls
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old housebound female presented with progressive mobility issues and a fear of falling. Clinical examination noted significant quadriceps weakness, and labs confirmed a 25(OH)D of 10 nmol/L. Following a 6-week loading course of vitamin D3, her muscle strength improved significantly, and her Timed Up and Go (TUG) test scores normalised.

vitamin_d_deficiency_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic liver disease-induced vitamin D deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice and pruritus
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis was found to have a 25(OH)D of 19 nmol/L during a pre-transplant workup. The deficiency was attributed to both poor dietary intake and impaired hepatic 25-hydroxylation. He was managed with oral colecalciferol, though higher doses were required to achieve therapeutic levels due to cholestasis.

vitamin_d_deficiency_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Treatment-resistant vitamin D deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Persistent low vitamin D despite supplementation
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female reported no improvement in her vitamin D levels (consistently <25 nmol/L) despite being prescribed 800 IU daily for a year. A supervised loading dose was administered to rule out non-adherence, but levels remained low, prompting an investigation into occult malabsorption. She was eventually diagnosed with Crohn's disease affecting the jejunum.

vitamin_d_deficiency_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Anticonvulsant-induced vitamin D deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Routine bone health screen for epilepsy
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male on long-term phenytoin for epilepsy was screened for bone disease. Phenytoin, a cytochrome P450 inducer, had accelerated the catabolism of vitamin D, leading to a level of 22 nmol/L. He required double the standard maintenance dose of colecalciferol to maintain a level above 50 nmol/L.

vitamin_d_deficiency_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Pregnancy-associated vitamin D deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Routine antenatal screening
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old pregnant female (28 weeks gestation) who wears a hijab was found to have a 25(OH)D of 14 nmol/L. There were concerns regarding neonatal hypocalcaemia and congenital rickets. She was treated with 4000 IU daily for the remainder of her pregnancy, and the neonate was started on vitamin D drops from birth.

vitamin_d_deficiency_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Glucocorticoid-induced bone loss with vitamin D deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Vertebral crush fracture
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male on long-term prednisolone for polymyalgia rheumatica presented with acute back pain. Imaging confirmed a T12 compression fracture, and labs showed a 25(OH)D of 26 nmol/L. His management plan included high-dose vitamin D and calcium to optimise the efficacy of bisphosphonate therapy for steroid-induced osteoporosis.

vitamin_d_deficiency_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Hungry bone syndrome post-parathyroidectomy
  presenting_complaint: Acute tetany post-surgery
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female underwent surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism. Post-operatively, she developed severe, symptomatic hypocalcaemia (1.75 mmol/L) because her pre-existing, untreated vitamin D deficiency (15 nmol/L) exacerbated the rapid skeletal uptake of calcium (hungry bone syndrome). She required aggressive IV calcium and high-dose oral vitamin D loading.

vitamin_d_deficiency_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Nutritional deficiency in a vegan diet
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue and brittle nails
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female who had been vegan for five years presented with non-specific symptoms. Blood tests revealed a 25(OH)D of 28 nmol/L and borderline low vitamin B12. She was started on a vegan-certified D3 supplement (derived from lichen) and educated on fortified food sources, leading to symptom resolution.

vitamin_d_deficiency_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Institutionalisation-related vitamin D deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Fragility fracture of the neck of femur
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old male resident of a nursing home was admitted following a fall. He had not been outdoors for over two years and was not on supplements; his 25(OH)D was 8 nmol/L. Following surgical fixation of the hip, he was started on a lifelong vitamin D and calcium combination to reduce the risk of future fractures.

vitamin_d_deficiency_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Obesity-related vitamin D sequestration
  presenting_complaint: Chronic knee pain
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female with a BMI of 46 kg/m2 presented with osteoarthritis symptoms. Despite a seemingly adequate diet, her 25(OH)D was 21 nmol/L, likely due to sequestration of the fat-soluble vitamin in adipose tissue. She required a loading dose three times higher than a normal-weight individual to achieve a sufficient serum concentration.

vitamin_d_deficiency_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Crohn's disease with severe malabsorption
  presenting_complaint: Exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male with a history of multiple terminal ileal resections presented with a flare-up. Routine monitoring showed a 25(OH)D of 12 nmol/L and low magnesium. Due to extensive bowel resection and active inflammation, he was treated with intramuscular vitamin D injections to bypass the gastrointestinal tract.

vitamin_d_deficiency_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Vitamin D deficiency mimicking fibromyalgia
  presenting_complaint: Chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female had been treated for fibromyalgia for two years with minimal relief from gabapentin. A new GP checked her 25(OH)D, which was 11 nmol/L, with a significantly elevated ALP. After intensive vitamin D replacement, her "fibromyalgia" symptoms resolved completely within three months, confirming the diagnosis of osteomalacic pain.
