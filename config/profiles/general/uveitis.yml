  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female was noted to have a lighter-coloured iris in the left eye compared to the right. Examination showed diffuse, fine stellate keratic precipitates and a posterior subcapsular cataract. No treatment was required for the low-grade inflammation, but she eventually underwent uncomplicated cataract surgery.

uveitis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Sarcoidosis-associated Uveitis
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral red eyes, dry cough, and skin nodules.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female presented with bilateral granulomatous anterior uveitis and "mutton-fat" keratic precipitates. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and serum ACE was elevated at 110 U/L. She was managed with topical steroids and systemic Azathioprine in consultation with the respiratory team.

uveitis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Behçet’s Disease
  presenting_complaint: Painful red eye with a "visible white level" and recurrent mouth ulcers.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male presented with a shifting hypopyon and severe vitritis. He reported a history of recurrent oral and genital aphthous ulcers. He was diagnosed with Behçet’s disease and, due to the threat to his macula, was commenced on Infliximab infusions, which successfully stabilised the disease.

uveitis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Syphilitic Posterior Uveitis
  presenting_complaint: Distorted vision and floaters in both eyes.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male presented with bilateral placoid chorioretinitis. Detailed history-taking revealed a recent maculopapular rash. RPR and TPPA serology were strongly positive. He was admitted for a 14-day course of IV Benzylpenicillin, resulting in complete resolution of the ocular inflammation.
