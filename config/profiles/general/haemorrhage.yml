  presenting_complaint: Acute left-sided weakness and slurred speech
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with atrial fibrillation and an INR of 4.8 presented with focal neurological deficits. CT imaging showed a 30ml right-sided basal ganglia haemorrhage. Anticoagulation was urgently reversed with prothrombin complex concentrate and intravenous Vitamin K.

haemorrhage_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Ruptured ectopic pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Severe lower abdominal pain and syncope
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female, seven weeks pregnant, presented in hypovolaemic shock with a BP of 85/50 mmHg. Emergency laparotomy revealed a ruptured tubal pregnancy and 1.5 litres of haemoperitoneum. A right salpingectomy was performed, and the patient made a full recovery.

haemorrhage_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Vitreous haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of floaters and blurred vision
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes presented with a "curtain" over his vision. Slit-lamp examination revealed blood in the vitreous cavity, obscuring retinal detail. He was managed conservatively with head elevation and scheduled for urgent pan-retinal photocoagulation.

haemorrhage_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Haemoptysis and progressive breathlessness
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female with suspected systemic vasculitis presented with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Bronchoalveolar lavage demonstrated increasingly bloody return, confirming alveolar haemorrhage. She was transferred to ICU for methylprednisolone pulse therapy and plasma exchange.

haemorrhage_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Traumatic splenic rupture
  presenting_complaint: Left upper quadrant pain following a road traffic accident
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male presented to A&E after a high-velocity impact. Contrast CT demonstrated a Grade IV splenic laceration with active extravasation of contrast. Due to haemodynamic instability, he underwent an emergency splenectomy and received a four-unit blood transfusion.

haemorrhage_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Menorrhagia secondary to uterine fibroids
  presenting_complaint: Heavy menstrual bleeding and profound lethargy
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female reported changing sanitary products every hour during menses. Blood tests showed a microcytic anaemia with haemoglobin 72g/L. She was treated with tranexamic acid and oral iron supplements while awaiting uterine artery embolisation.

haemorrhage_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Bleeding colonic angiodysplasia
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of maroon-coloured stools
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old male with aortic stenosis presented with chronic iron-deficiency anaemia. Repeated endoscopies were inconclusive until a mesenteric angiogram identified angiodysplasia in the caecum. The lesion was successfully treated with argon plasma coagulation.

haemorrhage_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Oesophageal variceal haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Massive haematemesis and dizzy spells
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis presented with haematemesis and tachycardia. He was commenced on intravenous terlipressin and prophylactic antibiotics. Urgent endoscopy identified Grade III oesophageal varices, which were treated with endoscopic band ligation.

haemorrhage_015:

  presenting_complaint: Severe back pain and hypotension post-procedure
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention via the femoral artery. Two hours post-op, she developed flank pain and a drop in blood pressure. CT confirmed a large retroperitoneal haematoma, which was managed with prolonged manual compression and fluid resuscitation.

  primary_diagnosis: Haemorrhagic cystitis
  presenting_complaint: Visible haematuria and suprapubic discomfort
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male undergoing high-dose cyclophosphamide for lymphoma developed gross haematuria. Despite aggressive hydration and MESNA, bleeding persisted. Haemostasis was eventually achieved through continuous bladder irrigation and intravesical alum instillation.

haemorrhage_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Immune thrombocytopenic purpura
  presenting_complaint: Widespread petechiae and easy bruising
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old girl presented with a non-blanching purpuric rash following a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Laboratory tests revealed a profound thrombocytopenia (platelets 4 x 10^9/L). She was monitored closely as an outpatient and showed spontaneous resolution within three weeks.

  primary_diagnosis: Grade IV intraventricular haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Apnoeic episodes and bulging fontanelle in a neonate

  presenting_complaint: Fresh red bleeding from the mouth
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old male presented to A&E seven days after an elective tonsillectomy. Examination showed a small amount of fresh clot in the left tonsillar fossa. He was admitted for observation and intravenous antibiotics; the bleeding resolved without requiring a return to the operating theatre.
