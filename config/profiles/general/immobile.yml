  primary_diagnosis: Morbid Obesity with Hypoventilation Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Severe breathlessness and inability to mobilise from bed.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female with a BMI of 64 presented with Type 2 respiratory failure. She has been immobile for six months due to extreme weight and osteoarthritis, leading to extensive intertrigo and sacral pressure ulcers. She was admitted to a specialist bariatric ward for controlled weight loss and physiotherapy.

immobile_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis (Relapsing-Remitting)
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of paraparesis and bladder dysfunction.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female with known MS presented with a severe relapse, rendering her immobile and unable to stand. MRI showed new active demyelinating lesions in the thoracic spinal cord. She was treated with high-dose methylprednisolone, resulting in partial recovery of mobility over three weeks.

immobile_012:

  presenting_complaint: Severe "off" periods and frequent freezing of gait.
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old male with a 20-year history of Parkinson's now experiences profound bradykinesia and rigidity. He is largely immobile during "off" periods, which last several hours a day despite complex levodopa dosing. He requires a hoist for transfers and is being considered for apomorphine infusion.

  primary_diagnosis: Ankylosing Spondylitis
  presenting_complaint: Extreme spinal stiffness and inability to turn the head or torso.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with long-standing AS presented with "bamboo spine" on X-ray. His spinal column is fused, making him functionally immobile in the neck and trunk, significantly impacting his peripheral joint range. He was started on a TNF-alpha inhibitor to manage pain and prevent further peripheral joint involvement.

  primary_diagnosis: Functional Neurological Disorder (FND)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, unexplained paralysis of both legs.

  presenting_complaint: Severe generalised weakness and difficulty swallowing.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old female with known Myasthenia Gravis presented with rapidly worsening muscle fatigue. She became immobile and developed respiratory distress, necessitating intubation and ICU admission. She was treated with plasma exchange and regained mobility after ten days of intensive therapy.

immobile_018:

  presenting_complaint: Dyspnoea at rest and inability to walk more than a few steps.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with NYHA Class IV heart failure is now housebound and largely immobile due to profound exercise intolerance.
