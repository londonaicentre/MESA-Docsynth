abnormal_bowel_sounds_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Small Bowel Obstruction
  presenting_complaint: Colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, and absolute constipation for 24 hours.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with previous appendicectomy presented with sudden-onset abdominal distension and high-pitched, tinkling bowel sounds on auscultation. Abdominal X-ray confirmed dilated small bowel loops (3.5cm) with air-fluid levels. She was managed with 'drip and suck' (IV fluids and nasogastric tube decompression) and underwent adhesiolysis after failing conservative management over 48 hours.

Management involved electrolyte correction, mobilisation, and gradual reintroduction of oral intake, with bowel sounds returning on post-operative day five.

abnormal_bowel_sounds_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Viral Gastroenteritis
  presenting_complaint: Profuse watery diarrhoea, nausea, and loud stomach noises.
  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old boy presented to the GP with a 12-hour history of vomiting and frequent loose stools. Clinical examination revealed hyperactive bowel sounds (borborygmi) audible without a stethoscope and mild periumbilical tenderness. He was managed with oral rehydration therapy and symptoms resolved within 48 hours without complications.

abnormal_bowel_sounds_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Crohn’s Disease with Terminal Ileal Stricture
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent post-prandial cramping and audible "gurgling" in the right lower quadrant.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female with a known history of Crohn's presented with subacute worsening of obstructive symptoms. Auscultation revealed localised high-pitched "rushes" in the right iliac fossa followed by periods of silence. MRI enterography confirmed a 10cm fibrotic stricture in the terminal ileum, requiring a laparoscopic ileocaecal resection.

abnormal_bowel_sounds_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Mesenteric Ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal pain out of proportion to clinical findings.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with atrial fibrillation presented with sudden, excruciating central abdominal pain and metabolic acidosis. Initial examination showed a soft abdomen but absent bowel sounds and subsequent PR exam showed "redcurrant jelly" stool. CT angiography revealed an embolus in the superior mesenteric artery, leading to emergency laparotomy and bowel resection.

abnormal_bowel_sounds_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (Diarrhoea-predominant)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic bloating, urgency, and frequent loud abdominal rumbling.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male reported a 2-year history of fluctuating bowel habits exacerbated by stress. Physical exam was unremarkable except for frequent, hyperactive bowel sounds during an episode of bloating. After excluding coeliac disease and IBD via normal faecal calprotectin and serology, he was managed with a low FODMAP diet and mebeverine.

abnormal_bowel_sounds_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Ogilvie's Syndrome (Acute Colonic Pseudo-obstruction)
  presenting_complaint: Massive abdominal distension in a hospitalised patient.
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old female recovering from a fractured neck of femur developed severe abdominal girth increase over 48 hours. Auscultation revealed very sparse, low-pitched bowel sounds despite the clinical appearance of a mechanical obstruction. CT scan showed massive colonic dilatation without a mechanical cause, which responded to neostigmine and rectal tube decompression.

abnormal_bowel_sounds_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Perforated Peptic Ulcer
  presenting_complaint: Sudden "board-like" abdominal rigidity and severe epigastric pain.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male smoker presented with acute-onset upper abdominal pain that rapidly generalised. Examination revealed a silent abdomen and significant guarding/rebound tenderness in all quadrants. Erect chest X-ray showed free air under the diaphragm (pneumoperitoneum), and he was rushed for emergency Graham patch repair.

abnormal_bowel_sounds_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Ileocolic Intussusception
  presenting_complaint: Episodic inconsolable crying and drawing up of legs in an infant.
  summary_of_course: An 18-month-old male presented with intermittent paroxysms of pain; during these episodes, bowel sounds were hyperactive and high-pitched, while between episodes, they were diminished. An ultrasound confirmed the "target sign" in the right upper quadrant. He underwent successful air enema reduction under radiological guidance.

abnormal_bowel_sounds_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Coeliac Disease
  presenting_complaint: Chronic fatigue, iron-deficiency anaemia, and frequent borborygmi.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female presented with long-standing flatulence and loud, embarrassing bowel sounds after meals. Blood tests revealed positive anti-TTG antibodies and a subsequent duodenal biopsy showed Villous atrophy (Marsh 3c). Introduction of a strict gluten-free diet led to the resolution of gastrointestinal symptoms and normalisation of bowel sounds.

abnormal_bowel_sounds_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Superior Mesenteric Artery (SMA) Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Early satiety, post-prandial vomiting, and upper abdominal tinkling sounds.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female with rapid weight loss due to an eating disorder presented with worsening epigastric pain. Auscultation revealed high-pitched, obstructive bowel sounds localized to the epigastrium shortly after eating. A CT scan showed narrowing of the aortomesenteric angle (12 degrees), and she was treated with nutritional support via a nasojejunal tube.

abnormal_bowel_sounds_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Opioid-Induced Bowel Dysfunction
  presenting_complaint: Severe constipation and lack of bowel movement for 10 days.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male on high-dose morphine for metastatic prostate cancer presented with overflow diarrhoea and abdominal discomfort. Clinical examination revealed a distended, non-tender abdomen with very infrequent, sluggish bowel sounds (one every 2 minutes). He was treated with a combination of stimulant laxatives and the peripheral opioid antagonist methylnaltrexone.

  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Adhesive Small Bowel Obstruction (Partial)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of cramping and loud "splashing" sounds in the abdomen.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female with multiple previous laparotomies presented with her fourth episode of partial obstruction in two years. During the episode, examination revealed visible peristalsis and "succussion splash" on shaking the abdomen, alongside tinkling sounds. She was managed conservatively with a low-residue diet and gastrografin, which successfully promoted transit.

abnormal_bowel_sounds_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypokalaemia-induced Paralytic Ileus
  presenting_complaint: Generalised weakness and abdominal bloating.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female on long-term thiazide diuretics for hypertension presented with profound lethargy. Examination revealed a distended, tympanic abdomen with absent bowel sounds. Laboratory results showed a serum potassium of 2.1 mmol/L; following intravenous potassium replacement, her bowel sounds returned to normal and her distension resolved.

abnormal_bowel_sounds_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Carcinoid Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Episodic flushing, wheezing, and hyperactive bowel movements.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male presented with a 6-month history of frequent, watery diarrhoea and loud, constant bowel rumbling. During an episode of facial flushing, bowel sounds were noted to be extremely hyperactive. Urinary 5-HIAA was significantly elevated, and a CT scan identified a primary midgut neuroendocrine tumour with liver metastases.

  primary_diagnosis: Incarcerated Inguinal Hernia
  presenting_complaint: Painful lump in the groin and vomiting.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male presented with a non-reducible right inguinal swelling of 6 hours duration. Initially, bowel sounds were high-pitched and frequent, but they became progressively quiet over several hours. Emergency surgery revealed a loop of ischaemic ileum within the hernial sac, requiring a small bowel resection and primary anastomosis.

abnormal_bowel_sounds_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Diverticulitis with Pericolonic Abscess
  presenting_complaint: Left lower quadrant pain and localised "quietness" in the abdomen.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old female presented with a 4-day history of worsening left iliac fossa pain and fever. While bowel sounds were present in the right-sided quadrants, they were notably absent in the left lower quadrant. A CT scan confirmed Hinchey Stage II diverticulitis with a 5cm abscess, which was treated with CT-guided drainage and IV antibiotics.
