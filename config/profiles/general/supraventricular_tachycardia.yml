  presenting_complaint: Syncopal episode followed by rapid palpitations.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male presented in haemodynamic collapse with an irregularly irregular broad complex tachycardia at 250 bpm. Due to the risk of ventricular fibrillation, urgent DC cardioversion was performed. Subsequent EP mapping identified a left-sided accessory pathway which was successfully ablated.

supraventricular_tachycardia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Focal atrial tachycardia
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent "thumping" in the chest and exercise intolerance.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female was diagnosed with atrial tachycardia originating from the crista terminalis. The arrhythmia was refractory to bisoprolol and verapamil. She underwent successful radiofrequency catheter ablation, which resolved the symptoms and restored normal sinus rhythm.

supraventricular_tachycardia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Progressive oedema and orthopnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male presented with signs of congestive heart failure and a persistent SVT at 140 bpm. Echocardiogram revealed a reduced ejection fraction of 30%. Following successful rhythm control via electrical cardioversion and subsequent ablation, his ventricular function fully recovered over six months.

supraventricular_tachycardia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia (PJRT)
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of tachycardia during routine school screening.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old asymptomatic child was found to have a persistent heart rate of 150 bpm. ECG showed a long R-P interval tachycardia, characteristic of PJRT. Due to the risk of cardiomyopathy, he was referred for paediatric EP intervention.

supraventricular_tachycardia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: SVT triggered by thyrotoxicosis
  presenting_complaint: Tremor, weight loss, and rapid heart rate.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old female presented with acute SVT and signs of hyperthyroidism. Biochemistry confirmed a suppressed TSH and elevated free T4. Tachycardia was managed with propranolol while carbimazole was initiated to treat the underlying Graves' disease.

supraventricular_tachycardia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Orthodromic atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset chest tightness and palpitations.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male presented with a narrow complex tachycardia at 200 bpm. Adenosine 12mg resulted in termination of the arrhythmia. Baseline ECG showed no delta waves, indicating a concealed accessory pathway, later confirmed on EP study.

supraventricular_tachycardia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: SVT in a frail elderly patient
  presenting_complaint: Confusion and a fall at home.
  summary_of_course: An 89-year-old female with multiple comorbidities was found to have SVT at 160 bpm upon admission. Due to the risk of hypotension, she was treated with a cautious infusion of amiodarone rather than adenosine. The rhythm reverted, and her cognitive status improved significantly once normocardic.

  primary_diagnosis: Atypical AVNRT (Fast-Slow)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent, prolonged episodes of palpitations.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male presented with a long R-P tachycardia on ECG. Initial diagnosis of atrial tachycardia was revised to atypical AVNRT during EP study. Successful slow pathway modification was performed, preventing further recurrences.

  presenting_complaint: Palpitations accompanied by significant ST-segment depression.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male with stable angina presented with SVT at 180 bpm and associated chest pain. ECG showed 2mm ST depression in the precordial leads which resolved immediately upon reversion to sinus rhythm. Troponin levels remained negative, and subsequent coronary angiography showed no new obstructive lesions.

  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent SVT post-ablation
  presenting_complaint: Return of rapid heart rate three months after procedure.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female who previously underwent cryoablation for AVNRT presented with identical symptoms. Repeat EP study showed recovery of conduction in the slow pathway. A second ablation using radiofrequency energy was successful, and she has remained symptom-free for one year.

supraventricular_tachycardia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: SVT induced by stimulant use
  presenting_complaint: Agitation and heart racing after excessive caffeine intake.
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old student presented during exams with SVT at 195 bpm after consuming multiple energy drinks. The arrhythmia responded to a single dose of 6mg adenosine. He was counselled on stimulant avoidance and discharged with no further episodes on follow-up.
