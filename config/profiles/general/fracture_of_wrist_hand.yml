  primary_diagnosis: Greenstick fracture of the distal radius
  presenting_complaint: Pain and swelling of the left wrist following a fall from playground equipment.
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old male presented to A&E after falling onto an outstretched hand. Clinical examination revealed focal tenderness and mild volar angulation of the distal forearm. Radiographs confirmed a mid-shaft greenstick fracture of the distal radius; he underwent successful closed reduction under sedation and was placed in a long-arm cast for four weeks.

fracture_of_wrist_hand_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Colles' fracture
  presenting_complaint: Deformity and intense pain in the right wrist after slipping on ice.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female with known osteoporosis presented with a "dinner fork" deformity of the right wrist. X-rays showed a displaced extra-articular fracture of the distal radius with dorsal angulation and impaction. Due to the degree of instability, she underwent manipulation under anaesthesia (MUA) and K-wire fixation, followed by a six-week course of immobilisation.

fracture_of_wrist_hand_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Occult scaphoid fracture
  presenting_complaint: Persistent pain in the radial aspect of the wrist despite normal initial X-rays.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male presented ten days after a rugby injury with anatomical snuffbox tenderness. Initial radiographs at the time of injury were unremarkable, but repeat scaphoid views remained inconclusive despite clinical suspicion. An MRI scan confirmed a non-displaced fracture of the scaphoid waist, necessitating a thumb spica cast for eight weeks to prevent non-union.

fracture_of_wrist_hand_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Open fracture of the second and third metacarpals
  presenting_complaint: Severe pain, bleeding, and visible bone fragments following a crush injury.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old factory worker sustained a high-energy crush injury to his right hand. Examination in the trauma bay revealed a Gustilo-Anderson Grade II open injury with displaced fractures of the index and middle finger metacarpal shafts. He was treated with urgent surgical debridement, intravenous antibiotics, and internal fixation with plates and screws, followed by intensive hand physiotherapy.

fracture_of_wrist_hand_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Smith's fracture
  presenting_complaint: Pain and volar deformity of the wrist after falling onto a flexed hand.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male presented with a significant deformity of the left wrist following a fall. Radiographs revealed a Smith's fracture (reverse Colles') with volar displacement of the distal radial fragment. Given the unstable nature of the fracture, he underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with a volar locking plate, achieving good anatomical alignment.

fracture_of_wrist_hand_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Salter-Harris Type II distal radius fracture
  presenting_complaint: Wrist pain and swelling in a child following a fall from a bicycle.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy presented with acute wrist pain and limited range of motion. Imaging demonstrated a fracture through the growth plate exiting through the metaphysis of the distal radius. He was managed conservatively with a below-elbow backslab and close radiographic follow-up to monitor for potential growth arrest.

fracture_of_wrist_hand_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Bennett's fracture
  presenting_complaint: Pain and swelling at the base of the thumb after a boxing match.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old amateur boxer presented with inability to grip and swelling over the first carpometacarpal joint. Radiographs showed an intra-articular fracture-dislocation of the base of the first metacarpal. He required closed reduction and percutaneous K-wire fixation to stabilise the thumb base, followed by four weeks in a thumb spica.

fracture_of_wrist_hand_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Malunited distal radius fracture
  presenting_complaint: Chronic wrist pain, weakness, and visible deformity three months post-injury.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old female presented with significant radial deviation and restricted supination following a previously "conservatively managed" wrist fracture. Clinical review and imaging confirmed a malunion with significant dorsal tilt and ulnar variance. Due to functional impairment and secondary ulnocarpal impaction, she was referred for a corrective osteotomy and bone grafting.

fracture_of_wrist_hand_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Boxer's fracture (fifth metacarpal neck)
  presenting_complaint: Pain and loss of knuckle prominence after striking a hard object.
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old male presented with swelling over the ulnar aspect of the right hand after punching a wall in anger. X-rays confirmed a fracture of the fifth metacarpal neck with 40 degrees of volar angulation. As there was no rotational deformity, he was treated with an ulnar gutter splint and early mobilisation exercises.

fracture_of_wrist_hand_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Perilunate fracture-dislocation
  presenting_complaint: Extreme pain, deformity, and numbness in the median nerve distribution following a motorcycle RTC.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male was brought to the major trauma centre with a high-velocity wrist injury. Imaging revealed a trans-scaphoid perilunate dislocation with associated scaphoid waist fracture. He underwent emergency surgical reduction, carpal tunnel decompression, and internal fixation of the scaphoid to restore carpal stability.

fracture_of_wrist_hand_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Torus (buckle) fracture of the distal radius
  presenting_complaint: Mild wrist pain and reluctance to use the arm after a minor fall.
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old girl presented with focal tenderness over the distal radius but no obvious deformity. Radiographs showed a subtle cortical bulging (buckle) of the distal radial metaphysis. In line with local paediatric guidelines, she was treated with a removable Velcro splint for three weeks and discharged with parental advice.

fracture_of_wrist_hand_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Rolando fracture
  presenting_complaint: Severe thumb pain and swelling following a skiing accident.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented with a comminuted intra-articular Y-shaped fracture at the base of the first metacarpal. Unlike a Bennett's fracture, this Rolando fracture showed multiple fragments, making reduction challenging. She was treated with a combination of ORIF using a mini-fragment plate and temporary K-wires to reconstruct the articular surface.

fracture_of_wrist_hand_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Distal radius fracture with acute carpal tunnel syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Wrist pain and worsening paraesthesia in the thumb, index, and middle fingers.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female sustained a displaced distal radius fracture after a fall. Shortly after arrival, she developed progressive numbness and excruciating pain out of proportion to the injury. Recognising acute carpal tunnel syndrome, she was taken for urgent volar plate fixation and formal carpal tunnel release, resulting in immediate symptomatic relief.

fracture_of_wrist_hand_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Scaphoid non-union with SNAC wrist
  presenting_complaint: Chronic, worsening radial-sided wrist pain and reduced grip strength.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old male presented with a two-year history of wrist pain following an untreated "sprain." Imaging revealed a scaphoid non-union with advanced carpal collapse (Scaphoid Non-union Advanced Collapse - SNAC). He underwent a salvage procedure involving a proximal row carpectomy to alleviate pain and preserve some wrist motion.

fracture_of_wrist_hand_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Volar Barton's fracture
  presenting_complaint: Unstable wrist injury following a high-impact fall onto an extended hand.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male presented with an intra-articular fracture of the distal radius where the carpus had subluxed volarly with the fracture fragment. This Barton's fracture was highly unstable; he was treated with open reduction and a volar locking plate to secure the articular rim. Post-operative recovery was complicated by minor tendon irritation requiring early hardware removal.

fracture_of_wrist_hand_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Comminuted distal radius fracture in a patient with Parkinson's disease
  presenting_complaint: Wrist pain and deformity after a fall secondary to gait instability.
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old male with advanced Parkinson's disease and significant tremors presented with a comminuted distal radius fracture. Due to his high surgical risk and the likelihood of hardware failure from persistent tremors, he was managed non-operatively in a lightweight cast. Despite a degree of malunion, he regained sufficient functional use for activities of daily living.

fracture_of_wrist_hand_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Multiple metacarpal fractures with degloving injury
  presenting_complaint: Severe hand trauma with skin loss and multiple fractures after a machinery accident.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old mechanic's hand was caught in a belt drive, resulting in displaced fractures of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th metacarpals and a significant dorsal degloving injury. He required multiple staged procedures, including ORIF of the fractures and a groin flap for soft tissue coverage. Long-term outcomes were limited by significant tendon adhesions requiring secondary tenolysis.

fracture_of_wrist_hand_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Fracture of the hook of hamate
  presenting_complaint: Vague ulnar-sided wrist pain exacerbated by swinging a golf club.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old professional golfer complained of chronic pain in the hypothenar eminence. Standard wrist X-rays were normal, but a carpal tunnel view and subsequent CT scan revealed a fracture of the hook of hamate. Because of persistent symptoms and the risk of ulnar nerve irritation, the fracture fragment was surgically excised, allowing a return to sport at three months.

fracture_of_wrist_hand_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Open distal radius fracture with septic shock
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, fever, and a foul-smelling wound on the wrist.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old nursing home resident with dementia presented four days after an unwitnessed fall. She was found to have a neglected Grade III open distal radius fracture with visible necrotic tissue and signs of systemic sepsis (BP 85/50, Temp 39.1°C). She required aggressive fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and emergency debridement with external fixation, though her recovery was protracted by acute kidney injury.

fracture_of_wrist_hand_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Distal ulnar physeal fracture
  presenting_complaint: Ulnar-sided wrist pain and swelling in a teenager after a fall.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old male sustained a Salter-Harris IV fracture of the distal ulna. While the radial fracture healed well, the ulnar physeal injury led to premature physeal closure. Over the following year, he developed a positive ulnar variance and compensatory radial bowing, eventually requiring an ulnar shortening osteotomy to address the resulting impaction syndrome.
