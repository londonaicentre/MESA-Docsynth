diabetic_gastroparesis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic diabetic gastroparesis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic nausea and early satiety
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female with Type 1 Diabetes for 20 years presents with 6 months of postprandial fullness and bloating. A 4-hour scintigraphic gastric emptying study (GES) confirmed 25% retention at 4 hours. Managed in the outpatient clinic with low-fibre small frequent meals and oral domperidone, resulting in moderate symptomatic improvement.

diabetic_gastroparesis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe diabetic gastroparesis with malnutrition
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent vomiting of undigested food and 10kg weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with long-standing Type 2 Diabetes and peripheral neuropathy presented with significant unintentional weight loss and daily emesis. OGD revealed large amounts of retained food despite a 12-hour fast, and GES showed 60% retention at 4 hours. Commenced on liquid nutritional supplements and erythromycin cycles to improve gastric motility.

diabetic_gastroparesis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic diabetic gastroparesis
  presenting_complaint: Intractable vomiting and abdominal pain
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male with brittle Type 1 Diabetes presented to A&E with acute-on-chronic gastric stasis triggered by a viral URTI. Admission was required for IV rehydration and glycaemic control via variable rate insulin infusion (VRII). Symptoms settled over 72 hours with IV metoclopramide before transitioning back to oral prokinetics.

diabetic_gastroparesis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic gastroparesis mimicking cyclic vomiting syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Episodic bouts of severe nausea and vomiting
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old adolescent with poorly controlled Type 1 Diabetes (HbA1c 92 mmol/mol) presented with monthly episodes of profuse vomiting lasting 3 days. Differential included cyclic vomiting syndrome, but GES during a stable period showed 45% retention. Improved glycaemic management and low-dose amitriptyline for visceral hypersensitivity reduced episode frequency.

diabetic_gastroparesis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-transplant diabetic gastroparesis
  presenting_complaint: Severe epigastric bloating post-meal
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male, 12 months post-simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplant, experienced worsening gastric stasis despite a functioning pancreas graft. Investigations confirmed pre-existing autonomic neuropathy as the driver of persistent gastroparesis. Managed with prucalopride and dietary modification by a specialist dietitian.

diabetic_gastroparesis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild diabetic gastroparesis
  presenting_complaint: Occasional postprandial nausea
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female with newly diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes and obesity complained of mild dyspepsia. OGD was normal, but a 13C-octanoic acid breath test indicated mildly delayed gastric emptying. Symptoms resolved with improved glycaemic control and cessation of a GLP-1 receptor agonist which was exacerbating the delay.

diabetic_gastroparesis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory diabetic gastroparesis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent vomiting despite maximal medical therapy
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female with Type 1 Diabetes failed to respond to metoclopramide, domperidone, and erythromycin. She required insertion of a jejunostomy tube (PEJ) for enteral nutrition due to life-threatening weight loss and recurrent electrolyte imbalances. Currently being assessed for a gastric electrical stimulator.

diabetic_gastroparesis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic gastroparesis with phytobezoar
  presenting_complaint: Acute epigastric pain and obstructive symptoms
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with Type 2 Diabetes presented with sudden onset upper abdominal pain. OGD identified a large phytobezoar in the gastric antrum secondary to severe stasis. The bezoar was successfully fragmented endoscopically and treated with Coca-Cola lavage, followed by long-term prokinetic therapy.

diabetic_gastroparesis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic gastroparesis complicated by DKA
  presenting_complaint: Vomiting, ketotic breath, and confusion
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female with Type 1 Diabetes presented in Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) precipitated by severe gastric stasis. The inability to tolerate oral intake led to insulin omission and subsequent ketosis. Following DKA resolution, she was started on a subcutaneous insulin pump to better manage the mismatch between carbohydrate absorption and insulin action.

diabetic_gastroparesis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic gastroparesis in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Severe nausea and vomiting in the second trimester
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old pregnant female (18 weeks gestation) with pre-existing Type 1 Diabetes presented with symptoms initially attributed to hyperemesis gravidarum. Persistent symptoms and history of retinopathy suggested underlying gastroparesis. Managed with ginger, small meals, and cautious use of metoclopramide under obstetric medicine supervision.

diabetic_gastroparesis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic gastroparesis with autonomic neuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Dizziness and postprandial vomiting
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male with Type 2 Diabetes presented with symptoms of both gastroparesis and orthostatic hypotension. Tilt-table testing and GES confirmed widespread autonomic dysfunction. Treatment involved a multi-modal approach including midodrine for blood pressure and liquid-phase prokinetics for gastric emptying.

diabetic_gastroparesis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic gastroparesis with pyloric spasm
  presenting_complaint: Refractory vomiting and upper abdominal distension
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with long-standing diabetes and severe gastroparesis underwent pyloric manometry which showed high-pressure pyloric contractions. He underwent a Gastric Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy (G-POEM) procedure. Post-procedural GES showed significant improvement in emptying times and a 70% reduction in symptom score.

diabetic_gastroparesis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening diabetic gastroparesis
  presenting_complaint: Aspiration pneumonia and severe dehydration
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old frail male with Type 2 Diabetes was admitted to the ICU with aspiration pneumonia secondary to massive gastric reflux of retained food. Following treatment for sepsis, he required a nasojejunal (NJ) tube for safe feeding. Due to multiple comorbidities, he was eventually transitioned to a palliative care pathway focusing on symptom control.

diabetic_gastroparesis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic gastroparesis with hypokalaemia
  presenting_complaint: Profound weakness and palpitations
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male with Type 1 Diabetes presented with severe hypokalaemia (K+ 2.4 mmol/L) due to chronic vomiting. ECG showed U-waves and prolonged QT interval. Following IV potassium replacement, a diagnosis of severe diabetic gastroparesis was confirmed via GES (55% retention), and he was stabilised on a prokinetic regimen.

diabetic_gastroparesis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic gastroparesis with diagnostic challenge
  presenting_complaint: Chronic mid-abdominal pain and bloating
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female with Type 2 Diabetes was initially investigated for gallstones and mesenteric ischaemia due to atypical abdominal pain. Normal scans led to a GES, which revealed severe delay. Her pain, rather than vomiting, was the dominant feature, responding well to low-dose gabapentin and dietary changes.

diabetic_gastroparesis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic gastroparesis post-viral exacerbation
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of nausea after gastroenteritis
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female with well-controlled Type 1 Diabetes developed persistent vomiting following a bout of Norovirus. While the infection cleared, her gastric motility did not recover to baseline, requiring a temporary switch to a liquid diet and a 4-week course of erythromycin to "reset" gastric emptying.

diabetic_gastroparesis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic gastroparesis with secondary GORD
  presenting_complaint: Severe heartburn and nocturnal regurgitation
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male with Type 2 Diabetes presented with refractory gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). OGD showed Grade C oesophagitis and food residue. GES confirmed that delayed gastric emptying was the primary driver of his reflux; symptoms improved significantly once prokinetics were added to his high-dose PPI therapy.

diabetic_gastroparesis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic gastroparesis in an elderly patient
  presenting_complaint: Loss of appetite and "feeling full" after two bites
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male with Type 2 Diabetes and CKD Stage 3 presented with progressive anorexia. Initial concerns for gastric malignancy were ruled out by OGD. GES confirmed gastroparesis, likely exacerbated by uraemia; managed with dose-adjusted domperidone and small, nutrient-dense meals.

diabetic_gastroparesis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic gastroparesis with extrapyramidal side effects
  presenting_complaint: Nausea and sudden involuntary facial movements
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female with Type 1 Diabetes and gastroparesis was started on metoclopramide. Within 48 hours, she developed acute dystonia (oculogyric crisis). The medication was ceased, symptoms reversed with procyclidine, and her gastroparesis was subsequently managed with ondansetron and dietary modification.

diabetic_gastroparesis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic gastroparesis with brittle glycaemic control
  presenting_complaint: Unpredictable hypoglycaemia followed by hyperglycaemia
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old male with Type 1 Diabetes experienced frequent severe hypoglycaemia shortly after meals, followed by delayed hyperglycaemia 6 hours later. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and GES confirmed a "mismatch" due to gastroparesis. Stabilised by using a dual-wave insulin bolus and switching to a liquid-heavy diet during the day.
