  presenting_complaint: Abdominal distension, bile-stained aspirates, and apnoeic episodes.
  summary_of_course: A 28-week preterm neonate on the NICU developed sudden clinical deterioration on day 10 of life. Abdominal X-ray showed pneumatosis intestinalis and a "football sign" indicating massive pneumoperitoneum. Emergency bedside laparotomy was performed, revealing multiple areas of gangrenous ileum requiring resection and stoma formation.

bowel_perforation_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Traumatic small bowel rupture
  presenting_complaint: Blunt abdominal trauma and seatbelt sign following a high-speed road traffic accident.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male presented to A&E with tachycardia and evolving peritonism. Initial FAST scan was positive for free fluid, and CT showed mesenteric haematoma and free gas. Laparotomy revealed a complete transection of the mid-jejunum, which was treated with primary end-to-end anastomosis.

bowel_perforation_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Perforated sigmoid malignancy
  presenting_complaint: Ten-day history of worsening constipation followed by sudden collapse and diffuse pain.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with weight loss and anaemia presented in extremis. CT imaging identified a large obstructing mass in the sigmoid colon with proximal perforation.

  primary_diagnosis: Foreign body perforation (Fish bone)
  presenting_complaint: Vague, localised right-sided abdominal pain and low-grade pyrexia.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female presented with subacute symptoms over 72 hours. CT abdomen revealed a linear, radio-opaque object piercing the wall of the distal jejunum with a small amount of localised free gas. She underwent laparoscopic retrieval of a 3cm fish bone and primary repair of the small bowel.

bowel_perforation_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Ischaemic bowel perforation
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal pain "out of proportion to clinical findings" and metabolic acidosis.
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old female with atrial fibrillation presented with sudden mesenteric ischaemia. By the time of surgical review, she had developed signs of peritonitis; laparotomy revealed extensive necrosis and perforation of the ascending colon. Due to the extent of ischaemia and comorbidities, the family opted for a palliative approach.

bowel_perforation_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Steroid-masked peptic ulcer perforation
  presenting_complaint: Mild abdominal discomfort, progressive tachycardia, and confusion.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male on long-term high-dose prednisolone for rheumatoid arthritis presented with subtle clinical signs. Despite minimal guarding, CT showed a large volume of free gas from a perforated gastric ulcer. The diagnosis was delayed due to the masking effect of steroids on inflammatory signs, requiring extensive peritoneal washout.

bowel_perforation_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Perforated appendicitis
  presenting_complaint: Migratory RIF pain, high fever, and rebound tenderness.
  summary_of_course: A 9-year-old boy presented with a 48-hour history of worsening pain. Ultrasound confirmed a dilated, non-compressible appendix with an adjacent fluid collection and an appendicolith. Laparoscopic appendicectomy confirmed a gangrenous, perforated appendix with localised purulent peritonitis.

bowel_perforation_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Perforated toxic megacolon
  presenting_complaint: Bloody diarrhoea, severe abdominal bloating, and high-grade fever.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male with a known flare of ulcerative colitis failed to respond to intravenous steroids and infliximab. He developed sudden abdominal distension and hypotension; X-ray showed a colonic diameter of 8cm with free air. He underwent an emergency subtotal colectomy and end ileostomy.

bowel_perforation_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Anastomotic leak with perforation
  presenting_complaint: New-onset AF, rising inflammatory markers, and feculent drain output on post-operative day 5.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female underwent an elective anterior resection for rectal cancer. On day 5, her condition deteriorated with signs of sepsis and peritonitis. CT with rectal contrast confirmed a breakdown of the anastomosis (perforation), necessitating a re-laparotomy and formation of a Hartmann’s pouch.

bowel_perforation_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Spontaneous gastric perforation (Neonatal)
  presenting_complaint: Massive abdominal distension and respiratory distress in a 2-day-old infant.
  summary_of_course: A full-term neonate with no prior issues developed sudden, severe gastric dilatation. X-ray showed a massive pneumoperitoneum (saddle-bag sign). Emergency surgery revealed a large spontaneous perforation along the greater curvature of the stomach, which was primarily repaired.

bowel_perforation_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Typhoid ileal perforation
  presenting_complaint: Three-week history of fever and headache followed by sudden, severe right-sided abdominal pain.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male recently returned from South Asia presented with enteric fever. On day 21 of illness, he developed acute peritonitis; CT confirmed gas near the terminal ileum. He underwent emergency laparotomy where a single "punched-out" perforation in the ileum was found and repaired.

bowel_perforation_016:
  primary_diagnosis: NSAID-induced jejunal perforation
  presenting_complaint: Chronic mid-abdominal pain and recent development of rigors.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female taking high-dose naproxen for osteoarthritis presented with subacute peritonitis. CT scan showed free gas and thickening of the proximal jejunum. At surgery, multiple "punched-out" ulcers were noted in the small bowel, one of which had perforated, necessitating a small bowel resection.

bowel_perforation_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Caecal "blow-out" perforation
  presenting_complaint: Massive abdominal distension and sudden, sharp pain in the right flank.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with an obstructing distal sigmoid tumour presented with a caecal diameter of 13cm on CT. Shortly after admission, he experienced a sudden increase in pain and collapse. Emergency surgery confirmed a caecal "blow-out" perforation due to closed-loop obstruction, requiring a total abdominal colectomy.

bowel_perforation_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Stercoral colonic perforation
  presenting_complaint: Chronic constipation followed by sudden onset of severe pelvic pain and sepsis.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old bedbound patient with chronic faecal impaction presented with peritonitis. CT showed a large faecaloma in the rectosigmoid with extraluminal gas and faecal material. Surgery confirmed a stercoral perforation caused by pressure necrosis from hard stool, treated with Hartmann’s procedure.

bowel_perforation_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Perforated Meckel’s diverticulum
  presenting_complaint: Periumbilical pain mimicking appendicitis but located more centrally.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old male presented with features of acute abdomen. During laparoscopy for suspected appendicitis, the appendix was found to be normal, but a perforated Meckel’s diverticulum was identified approximately 50cm from the ileocaecal valve. A wedge resection of the diverticulum was performed.

bowel_perforation_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Duodenal perforation post-ERCP
  presenting_complaint: Severe epigastric and back pain following an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female underwent ERCP for common bile duct stones. Post-procedure, she developed worsening pain and tachycardia; CT revealed retroperitoneal air around the second part of the duodenum (Stapfer Type II injury). She was managed conservatively with nasogastric suction, intravenous fluids, and antibiotics, showing gradual recovery.
