transplant_failure_or_rejection_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic ductopenic liver rejection
  presenting_complaint: Progressive jaundice and intractable pruritus.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old girl, three years post-liver transplant for biliary atresia, presented with worsening cholestatic liver function tests. Liver biopsy demonstrated vanishing bile duct syndrome with >50% ductopenia and obliterative arteriopathy. Despite optimization of immunosuppression, she developed biliary cirrhosis and has been listed for re-transplantation.

transplant_failure_or_rejection_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Hyperacute heart transplant rejection
  presenting_complaint: Immediate intraoperative graft failure.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male underwent orthotopic heart transplantation but failed to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass due to profound biventricular failure. Immediate transoesophageal echocardiography showed a global lack of contractility, and the graft appeared cyanotic and mottled. Despite emergency ECMO initiation and plasmapheresis for suspected pre-formed antibodies, the patient died from multi-organ failure.

transplant_failure_or_rejection_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (Chronic Lung Allograft Dysfunction)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive exertional dyspnoea and dry cough.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female, five years post-bilateral lung transplant for COPD, showed a sustained 25% decline in FEV1 over six months. High-resolution CT demonstrated mosaic attenuation and air trapping, consistent with BOS Grade 2. Management included the addition of azithromycin and a trial of montelukast, though her respiratory function remained stable but significantly impaired.

transplant_failure_or_rejection_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute antibody-mediated kidney rejection
  presenting_complaint: Sudden weight gain and peripheral oedema.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old highly sensitised female presented two weeks post-renal transplant with oliguria. Investigations revealed high-titre donor-specific antibodies (DSA) and biopsy showed peritubular capillaritis with strong C4d staining. She underwent a course of therapeutic plasma exchange, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), and rituximab, resulting in a partial recovery of graft function.

transplant_failure_or_rejection_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD)
  presenting_complaint: Maculopapular rash and profuse watery diarrhoea.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male, 30 days post-allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant for AML, developed a generalized erythroderma and high-volume diarrhoea (2L/day). Skin and colonic biopsies confirmed Grade IV acute GvHD. Treatment involved high-dose systemic corticosteroids and second-line ruxolitinib due to steroid-refractory disease.

transplant_failure_or_rejection_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute pancreas allograft rejection
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal pain and rising serum amylase.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male, one year post-simultaneous kidney-pancreas (SPK) transplant, presented with graft tenderness and hyperglycaemia. Biochemical markers showed an isolated rise in amylase and lipase with stable renal function. Percutaneous biopsy of the pancreas graft confirmed acute cellular rejection, which responded to anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) therapy.

transplant_failure_or_rejection_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Corneal endothelial graft rejection
  presenting_complaint: Blurred vision and redness in the right eye.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male, nine months post-Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK), presented with a sudden drop in visual acuity. Slit-lamp examination revealed a Khodadoust line and stromal oedema.

transplant_failure_or_rejection_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute small bowel allograft rejection
  presenting_complaint: High stoma output and metabolic acidosis.
  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old child, three months post-isolated intestinal transplant, presented with stoma outputs exceeding 100ml/kg/day and abdominal distension. Endoscopy showed mucosal friability and blunting of villi, confirmed on histology as moderate acute rejection. Treatment required escalation to OKT3 and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) support during the recovery phase.

transplant_failure_or_rejection_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic allograft nephropathy (IFTA)
  presenting_complaint: Slow rise in creatinine and new proteinuria.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male, twelve years post-renal transplant, showed a gradual decline in eGFR from 45 to 25 mL/min/1.73m² over two years. A surveillance biopsy demonstrated extensive interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) with no active inflammation. Management focused on blood pressure control and ACE inhibition to slow the progression towards end-stage renal failure.

transplant_failure_or_rejection_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute cellular liver rejection (ACR)
  presenting_complaint: Fever and malaise ten days post-surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female underwent a liver transplant for primary biliary cholangitis. On post-operative day 10, her ALT and GGT levels tripled, and she developed a low-grade fever. A liver biopsy showed portal inflammation and bile duct damage (Banff ACR score 6/9), which resolved rapidly following three days of methylprednisolone pulses.

transplant_failure_or_rejection_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Subclinical heart transplant rejection
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic; detected on routine biopsy.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female, four months post-heart transplant, underwent a scheduled surveillance endomyocardial biopsy. While she was haemodynamically stable with normal echocardiography, the biopsy showed multifocal aggressive lymphocytic infiltrates (ISHLT Grade 2R). Her maintenance mycophenolate mofetil dose was increased, and follow-up biopsy at one month showed regression to Grade 0.

transplant_failure_or_rejection_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic renal transplant rejection
  presenting_complaint: Uraemic symptoms following medication non-adherence.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male with a history of chronic graft dysfunction (baseline creatinine 180 µmol/L) admitted to missing tacrolimus doses for two weeks. He presented with nausea, fluid overload, and a creatinine of 450 µmol/L. Biopsy showed acute cellular rejection superimposed on chronic scarring; graft salvage was attempted with steroids, but he ultimately returned to long-term haemodialysis.

transplant_failure_or_rejection_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute cellular lung rejection (Grade A2)
  presenting_complaint: Mild cough and 12% drop in FEV1.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male, eight months post-single lung transplant, noted a subtle decrease in his home spirometry readings. Physical examination was unremarkable, but transbronchial biopsy revealed perivascular lymphocytic cuffing consistent with Grade A2 rejection. He was treated with an oral prednisolone taper, which resulted in the recovery of his baseline lung function.

transplant_failure_or_rejection_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary non-function of liver graft
  presenting_complaint: Immediate post-operative coagulopathy and coma.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male received a liver from a donor after circulatory death (DCD). Within 12 hours post-op, he developed profound lactic acidosis, an AST >5000 U/L, and an INR of 5.2. Despite maximal intensive care support, the graft failed to function (Primary Non-Function), and he underwent emergency re-transplantation 36 hours later.

transplant_failure_or_rejection_016:
  primary_diagnosis: BK virus nephropathy mimicking rejection
  presenting_complaint: Gradual rise in creatinine and viraemia.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male, one year post-kidney transplant, presented with a rising creatinine that was initially suspected to be rejection. However, urine cytology showed "decoy cells" and plasma BK PCR was 10^6 copies/mL; renal biopsy confirmed BKVN with characteristic viral inclusions. Management involved a cautious reduction in immunosuppression and the introduction of leflunomide, leading to stabilization of renal function.

transplant_failure_or_rejection_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Antibody-mediated heart rejection (pAMR)
  presenting_complaint: New onset of congestive heart failure symptoms.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female, two years post-heart transplant, presented with orthopnoea and peripheral oedema. Echocardiography showed a drop in ejection fraction from 60% to 35%. While the cellular biopsy was negative, immunofluorescence showed strong C4d positivity in capillaries, and DSA was detected, confirming AMR. She was treated with plasmapheresis and IVIg in the ICU.

transplant_failure_or_rejection_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Late acute renal rejection in a paediatric patient
  presenting_complaint: Hypertension and facial puffiness.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old boy, four years post-renal transplant, was found to have sub-therapeutic tacrolimus levels during a routine clinic visit. He presented with a BP of 155/95 mmHg and a 40% increase in creatinine. Biopsy confirmed acute cellular rejection (Banff 2A), likely secondary to adolescent non-concordance; he required inpatient steroid pulses and psychological support.

transplant_failure_or_rejection_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Islet cell graft failure
  presenting_complaint: Recurrence of hypoglycaemia unawareness.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with Type 1 diabetes, who had been insulin-independent for two years following islet cell transplantation, presented with rising HbA1c and frequent "hypos". C-peptide levels were found to be undetectable, indicating complete graft failure. She was transitioned back to a basal-bolus insulin regimen and continuous glucose monitoring.

transplant_failure_or_rejection_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Delayed graft function (DGF)
  presenting_complaint: Anuria following renal transplantation.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male received a kidney from a donor with a cold ischaemic time of 24 hours. Post-operatively, he remained anuric with a rising potassium, requiring three sessions of haemodialysis in the first week. A biopsy on day 7 showed acute tubular necrosis but no evidence of rejection; the graft eventually began functioning on day 12, with a creatinine of 160 µmol/L at discharge.
