CT abdomen revealed a 6cm peripherally enhancing fluid collection in segment VII and dilated bile ducts. She underwent ERCP for stone extraction and percutaneous drainage of the abscess, which grew E. coli; she recovered after 4 weeks of IV co-amoxiclav.

liver_abscess_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Amoebic liver abscess
  presenting_complaint: Subacute fever, dull RUQ ache, and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old male recently returned from a 3-month backpacking trip in Southeast Asia presented with a 2-week history of low-grade fever. Ultrasound showed a solitary 4cm "anchovy paste" appearance lesion in the right lobe; Entamoeba histolytica serology was positive. He was successfully treated with a 10-day course of metronidazole followed by diloxanide furoate.

liver_abscess_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Klebsiella liver abscess syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Fever, blurred vision, and abdominal tenderness
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes presented with sepsis and sudden onset unilateral visual loss. Imaging confirmed a large liver abscess and endophthalmitis; blood cultures grew hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (K1 serotype). Despite intensive IV ceftriaxone and intravitreal antibiotics, he suffered permanent visual impairment but the hepatic lesion resolved.

liver_abscess_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Neonatal pyogenic liver abscess
  presenting_complaint: Irritability, poor feeding, and abdominal distension
  summary_of_course: A 14-day-old neonate with a history of umbilical vein catheterisation for prematurity developed clinical sepsis. Abdominal US identified multiple small abscesses throughout the liver parenchyma. Following 6 weeks of targeted IV flucloxacillin and gentamicin, repeat imaging showed complete resolution without the need for surgical intervention.

liver_abscess_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic pyogenic liver abscess mimicking malignancy
  presenting_complaint: 3-month history of weight loss, night sweats, and hepatomegaly
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male smoker was referred for suspected hepatic metastasis after a 10kg weight loss. CT showed a complex, multiloculated mass in the left lobe with minimal inflammatory markers; however, biopsy revealed pus rather than malignant cells. Culture grew Streptococcus anginosus, likely from a dental source, and he responded to prolonged drainage and antibiotics.

liver_abscess_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Ruptured pyogenic liver abscess with peritonitis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset generalised abdominal pain and septic shock
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old female with a known 5cm liver abscess presented to A&E with acute peritonism and hypotension. Emergency laparotomy confirmed intraperitoneal rupture of the abscess into the Morrison's pouch.

  primary_diagnosis: Hepatosplenic candidiasis (Fungal liver abscesses)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent fever despite broad-spectrum antibiotics during neutropenic recovery
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male undergoing chemotherapy for AML developed "bull's eye" lesions on CT during his recovery from neutropenia. Liver biopsy confirmed Candida albicans hyphae. He was treated with liposomal amphotericin B followed by a 6-month course of oral fluconazole with gradual radiological improvement.

liver_abscess_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Pylephlebitis with secondary liver abscesses
  presenting_complaint: Fever and RUQ pain following recent appendicectomy
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented 10 days post-appendicectomy with high swinging fevers. CT venogram revealed superior mesenteric and portal vein thrombosis (pylephlebitis) with several small hepatic microabscesses. He required 6 months of anticoagulation and 8 weeks of IV antibiotics to achieve clinical and radiological resolution.

  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic liver abscess post-RFA
  presenting_complaint: Fever and localised pain 1 week after tumour ablation
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with HCC underwent radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of a 3cm lesion. He returned with rigors and leucocytosis; imaging showed an abscess at the ablation site. Percutaneous aspiration grew Staphylococcus aureus, and he was managed with a pigtail catheter and 4 weeks of flucloxacillin.

liver_abscess_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Liver abscess with pleuropulmonary extension
  presenting_complaint: Right-sided pleuritic chest pain and cough
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male presented with respiratory distress and RUQ pain. Imaging revealed a large superior right lobe abscess that had eroded through the diaphragm, causing a reactive sympathetic empyema. He required both a percutaneous liver drain and a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) procedure for decortication.

liver_abscess_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Pyogenic liver abscess secondary to Crohn's disease
  presenting_complaint: Fever and worsening abdominal pain in a patient with known IBD
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female with fistulising Crohn's disease presented with systemic upset. An MRI Enterography identified an entero-hepatic fistula leading to a segment IV liver abscess. She was managed with surgical resection of the affected bowel segment and drainage of the abscess, alongside an escalation of her biologic therapy.

liver_abscess_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Streptococcus bovis liver abscess secondary to occult CRC
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue, low-grade fever, and iron-deficiency anaemia
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male was diagnosed with a pyogenic liver abscess after blood cultures grew Streptococcus bovis (S. gallolyticus). Given the association with colonic pathology, a colonoscopy was performed which identified an asymptomatic Dukes' B adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon. The abscess was drained, and he subsequently underwent a high anterior resection.

liver_abscess_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Hepatic Melioidosis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic fever, cough, and multiple liver lesions
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old diabetic male who recently worked in rice fields in Northern Australia presented with subacute constitutional symptoms. CT showed a "honeycomb" appearance of multiple liver abscesses. Cultures grew Burkholderia pseudomallei; he required 4 weeks of IV ceftazidime followed by 6 months of oral co-trimoxazole.

liver_abscess_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Infected Hydatid Cyst
  presenting_complaint: Severe RUQ pain and anaphylactoid reaction
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female from a sheep-farming community presented with acute pain and urticaria. Imaging showed a large calcified cyst with internal membranes and gas, suggesting secondary bacterial infection of a hydatid cyst. She was treated with albendazole and underwent surgical cystectomy (PAIR was contraindicated due to the risk of rupture).

liver_abscess_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Cryptogenic pyogenic liver abscess
  presenting_complaint: Non-specific malaise and mild RUQ tenderness
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old previously healthy female presented with a 3cm solitary abscess in segment VIII. Extensive investigations, including colonoscopy, OGD, and echocardiogram, failed to find a primary source of infection. She was successfully treated with a 6-week course of oral ciprofloxacin and metronidazole after initial clinical stabilisation.

liver_abscess_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Multiple liver microabscesses secondary to IVDU
  presenting_complaint: Fever, pleuritic chest pain, and track marks on arms
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use presented with MRSA bacteraemia. CT showed multiple small, non-drainable microabscesses throughout the liver and septic pulmonary emboli. He was treated with a 6-week course of IV vancomycin and referred to addiction services.

liver_abscess_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Treatment-resistant ESBL Klebsiella liver abscess
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent fever despite 2 weeks of co-amoxiclav
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with a 7cm abscess failed to improve on standard therapy. Repeat cultures from the drain showed Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella. Treatment was escalated to IV meropenem based on sensitivities, leading to clinical improvement and eventual resolution of the collection.

liver_abscess_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute liver abscess with normal LFTs
  presenting_complaint: Night sweats and unexplained weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old female presented with constitutional symptoms but entirely normal liver function tests. A PET-CT performed for "pyrexia of unknown origin" showed intense FDG uptake in the liver. A subsequent CT-guided aspiration confirmed a pyogenic abscess (Streptococcus milleri), highlighting that normal LFTs do not exclude the diagnosis.

liver_abscess_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe liver abscess with multi-organ failure
  presenting_complaint: Comatose, septic shock, and anuric renal failure
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male was brought to A&E by family in a state of collapse. Imaging revealed a 12cm abscess occupying most of the right lobe with evidence of portal vein gas. He required emergency percutaneous drainage, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and mechanical ventilation in the ICU; he survived but required a long rehabilitation period.

liver_abscess_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild pyogenic liver abscess managed as outpatient
  presenting_complaint: Low-grade fever and mild RUQ discomfort
  summary_of_course: A 49-year-old male was diagnosed with a 2.5cm pyogenic abscess via his GP. After a 48-hour observation period in the hospital and initial IV antibiotics, he was discharged on the Outpatient Parenteral Antimicrobial Therapy (OPAT) pathway. He received daily IV ceftriaxone at home for 4 weeks with weekly blood monitoring and successful resolution.
