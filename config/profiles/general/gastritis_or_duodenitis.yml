  primary_diagnosis: Chemical gastropathy
  presenting_complaint: Epigastric pain and early satiety
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male with chronic back pain admitted to taking excessive amounts of ibuprofen and daily alcohol. Endoscopy revealed minimal inflammation but prominent foveolar hyperplasia and mucosal oedema. He was diagnosed with chemical gastropathy and advised on strict avoidance of irritants, leading to gradual symptom resolution.
