  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old male underwent a traumatic mid-forearm amputation following an industrial accident. He developed severe phantom sensations within weeks of the surgery. A combination of mirror box therapy, TENS, and pregabalin was initiated, resulting in a gradual reduction in the frequency of pain episodes.

chronic_pain_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Sickle cell disease with vaso-occlusive crisis
  presenting_complaint: Acute-on-chronic severe bone pain in the limbs and back.
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old male with HbSS disease was admitted to the haematology ward with a severe pain crisis. Despite regular hydroxycarbamide, he required IV morphine via patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and aggressive hydration. He was discharged after six days once his pain returned to his baseline chronic level.

chronic_pain_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Failed back surgery syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Persistent, non-radiating midline back pain following spinal fusion.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male underwent L4/L5 stabilisation two years ago but experienced no relief from his preoperative symptoms. Repeat imaging showed intact hardware but extensive epidural fibrosis. After failing conservative measures and injections, he was referred for a spinal cord stimulator trial.

chronic_pain_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Metastatic bone pain
  presenting_complaint: Severe, deep-seated nocturnal pain in the pelvis and lumbar spine.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer presented with escalating pain refractory to weak opioids. Investigations showed new blastic lesions on a bone scan. He received palliative radiotherapy and was started on a fentanyl patch and zoledronic acid, providing significant improvement in his quality of life.
