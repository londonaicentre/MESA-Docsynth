  primary_diagnosis: Insulin glargine overdose
  presenting_complaint: Persistent hypoglycaemia and decreased consciousness.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old type 1 diabetic injected 300 units of Lantus (glargine) intentionally. Despite repeated glucagon and dextrose boluses, he required a continuous 20% dextrose infusion for 72 hours to maintain euglycaemia. He remained neurologically intact and was eventually transferred to psychiatry.

  presenting_complaint: Coarse tremor, ataxia, and slurred speech.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old woman with bipolar disorder intentionally doubled her lithium dose for one week. Her serum lithium level was 3.2 mmol/L with associated acute kidney injury (Stage 2). She required aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation and temporary haemodialysis due to worsening neurotoxicity.

intentional_self_overdose_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Digoxin toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Visual disturbances (yellow halos) and nausea.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male intentionally ingested his entire month's supply of digoxin. ECG showed a slow ventricular rate with frequent PVCs and "reverse tick" ST depression. He was treated with Digoxin-specific antibody fragments (DigiFab) after his potassium rose to 6.2 mmol/L, resulting in rapid cardiac stabilisation.

intentional_self_overdose_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Verapamil SR overdose
  presenting_complaint: Hypotension and hyperglycaemia.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male ingested 4.8g of sustained-release verapamil. He developed complete heart block and refractory shock within 6 hours. Management involved calcium gluconate infusions, pacing, and high-dose insulin, but he unfortunately suffered a fatal cardiac arrest 12 hours post-ingestion.

intentional_self_overdose_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Iron supplement poisoning
  presenting_complaint: Haematemesis and severe abdominal pain.
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old female ingested 50 tablets of ferrous sulphate. Abdominal X-ray showed multiple radio-opaque tablets in the stomach. Due to a serum iron level of 95 µmol/L and signs of systemic toxicity, she was treated with intravenous deferoxamine chelation therapy.

intentional_self_overdose_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Quetiapine overdose
  presenting_complaint: CNS depression and tachycardia.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male was found somnolent after ingesting 5g of quetiapine. ECG revealed a corrected QT interval (QTc) of 520ms. He was monitored in a high-dependency unit for respiratory depression and cardiac arrhythmias, requiring only supportive care and serial ECGs until the QTc normalised.

  presenting_complaint: Respiratory rate of 6, pinpoint pupils, and GCS 5.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female was brought to A&E by ambulance after an intentional ingestion of oxycodone and diazepam. She responded immediately to 400mcg of intravenous naloxone with an improvement in respiratory effort. She required a naloxone infusion for 12 hours due to the long half-life of the opioid preparation.

intentional_self_overdose_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Valproate-induced hyperammonaemic encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Lethargy and paradoxical agitation.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male took an intentional overdose of sodium valproate (20g). While liver enzymes were only mildly elevated, his ammonia level was 180 µmol/L. He was treated with L-carnitine and lactulose, leading to a rapid improvement in his mental state as ammonia levels fell.

intentional_self_overdose_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Citalopram overdose with seizures
  presenting_complaint: Two brief tonic-clonic seizures in the department.
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old female ingested 800mg of citalopram. Shortly after arrival, she experienced two self-limiting seizures.

  presenting_complaint: Nystagmus, diplopia, and marked ataxia.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male with epilepsy intentionally took an extra 3g of phenytoin. His serum phenytoin level was 45 mg/L (reference range 10-20 mg/L). Management was purely supportive as there is no specific antidote, and his symptoms resolved over five days as levels slowly declined.

intentional_self_overdose_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Theophylline toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Intractable vomiting, palpitations, and hypokalaemia.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male ingested a large quantity of his wife's Uniphyllin (theophylline) tablets. He developed supraventricular tachycardia and a potassium level of 2.4 mmol/L. Due to a peak theophylline level of 90 mg/L, he underwent charcoal haemoperfusion to rapidly clear the drug.

  primary_diagnosis: Carbamazepine overdose
  presenting_complaint: Fluctuating consciousness and ileus.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old female ingested 10g of carbamazepine. Her GCS fluctuated between 6 and 13, and she developed a paralytic ileus which delayed drug absorption. She was treated with multiple-dose activated charcoal (MDAC) once bowel sounds returned, which successfully enhanced drug elimination.
