wilsons_disease_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic Wilson's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Sibling screening following family diagnosis
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old male underwent screening after his older sister was diagnosed with Wilson's disease. Investigations revealed a low serum ceruloplasmin of 0.12 g/L and mildly elevated ALT of 85 U/L. Genetic testing confirmed homozygous ATP7B mutations, and he was commenced on oral zinc acetate to prevent copper accumulation, remaining asymptomatic at 2-year follow-up.

wilsons_disease_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Fulminant Hepatic Failure due to Wilson's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Acute jaundice, confusion, and abdominal swelling
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old female presented with a 5-day history of rapidly progressing jaundice and Grade II hepatic encephalopathy. Labs showed a Coombs-negative haemolytic anaemia, markedly elevated bilirubin (450 µmol/L), and an abnormally low alkaline phosphatase to bilirubin ratio. She was diagnosed with fulminant Wilson's disease and underwent an emergency orthotopic liver transplant after failing to stabilise with plasmapheresis.

wilsons_disease_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Neurological Wilson's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Progressive "wing-beating" tremor and slurred speech
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male presented to neurology with a 6-month history of worsening dysarthria and a coarse bilateral upper limb tremor. Slit-lamp examination confirmed the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, and MRI brain showed the "face of the giant panda" sign in the midbrain. He was started on chelation therapy with trientine dihydrochloride, showing gradual improvement in motor symptoms over 12 months.

wilsons_disease_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Psychiatric Presentation of Wilson's Disease
  presenting_complaint: New-onset psychosis and personality changes
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female was initially admitted to a psychiatric ward with paranoid delusions and emotional lability. Physical examination revealed subtle dystonic posturing of the left hand, prompting a metabolic screen which showed a 24-hour urinary copper excretion of 8.4 µmol/day (normal <0.6). Treatment with penicillamine led to a significant resolution of psychiatric symptoms, though she required long-term multidisciplinary input.

wilsons_disease_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Wilson's Disease with Cirrhosis
  presenting_complaint: Haematemesis and distended abdomen
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol excess presented with variceal bleeding and ascites. While initially attributed to alcohol, a liver biopsy revealed rhodanine-positive copper deposits and quantitative copper of 1100 µg/g dry weight. Despite aggressive treatment with diuretics and trientine, his liver function remained borderline (Child-Pugh B), requiring long-term transplant waitlisting.

wilsons_disease_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Renal Fanconi Syndrome secondary to Wilson's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Polyuria, bone pain, and muscle weakness
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy presented with features of rickets and proximal renal tubular acidosis. Investigations identified glycosuria, phosphaturia, and aminoaciduria consistent with Fanconi syndrome. Further workup identified low ceruloplasmin and KF rings, confirming Wilson's disease as the underlying cause of the tubulopathy, which improved following copper chelation.

wilsons_disease_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Penicillamine-induced Nephrotic Syndrome in Wilson's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral leg swelling and foamy urine
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female, stable on D-penicillamine for 5 years, developed sudden-onset peripheral oedema. Urinalysis showed 4+ protein, and a 24-hour collection confirmed nephrotic-range proteinuria (6.2g/day). Penicillamine was discontinued due to drug-induced glomerulonephritis, and she was successfully transitioned to trientine and zinc maintenance therapy.

wilsons_disease_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Wilson's Disease in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Routine obstetric review for known Wilson's disease
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old pregnant female with known Wilson's disease required careful management of her copper-lowering therapy. Her trientine dose was reduced by 25% during the first trimester to balance the risk of copper toxicity against potential teratogenicity. The pregnancy proceeded to a term delivery of a healthy infant, with close monitoring of maternal liver function and serum copper throughout.

wilsons_disease_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis presentation of Wilson's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Nausea, malaise, and dark urine
  summary_of_course: A 17-year-old male presented with a 2-week history of lethargy and jaundice, mimicking viral hepatitis. Viral serology was negative, but his serum copper was elevated and ceruloplasmin was 0.08 g/L. He responded well to initial chelation with penicillamine, avoiding progression to acute liver failure.

wilsons_disease_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Late-onset Wilson's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Progressive stiffness and bradykinesia
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male was referred for suspected Parkinson's disease due to worsening rigidity and slow movements. Lack of response to levodopa prompted further investigation, revealing KF rings on slit-lamp and a high 24-hour urinary copper. This rare late-onset presentation of Wilson's disease was managed with zinc monotherapy, resulting in partial stabilisation of his neurological deficits.

wilsons_disease_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure in Wilson's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice and somnolence following medication non-compliance
  summary_of_course: A 20-year-old female with known Wilson's disease presented with decompensated cirrhosis after stopping her trientine for six months. She exhibited profound jaundice, coagulopathy (INR 3.4), and Grade III encephalopathy. Intensive care support and chelation were initiated, but she required a high-urgency liver transplant due to worsening multi-organ failure.

wilsons_disease_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Hepatic Wilson's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of raised transaminases
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old girl was found to have an ALT of 110 U/L during a routine check-up for eczema. Persistent elevations led to a chronic liver disease screen, revealing a low ceruloplasmin and a positive penicillamine challenge test. She was diagnosed with early-stage Wilson's disease and commenced on zinc acetate, which successfully normalised her liver enzymes.

wilsons_disease_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Wilson's Disease with Cardiac and Joint Involvement
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath and bilateral knee pain
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male presented with exertional dyspnoea and premature osteoarthritis of the knees. Echocardiography showed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and further screening for systemic causes identified Wilson's disease. While hepatic involvement was minimal, his multisystemic copper deposition required lifelong chelation, which improved his cardiac output but had limited impact on his joint damage.

wilsons_disease_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Ocular Wilson's Disease (Sunflower Cataracts)
  presenting_complaint: Blurred vision and difficulty focusing
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old male presented to an optician with visual disturbances. Slit-lamp examination revealed pathognomonic sunflower cataracts (chalcosis lentis) and peripheral KF rings. Subsequent biochemical testing confirmed Wilson's disease, and he was started on trientine, which led to a gradual regression of the lenticular opacities over several years.

wilsons_disease_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Dystonic Storm in Wilson's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Severe, painful muscle spasms and inability to swallow
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female with established Wilson's disease experienced a rapid neurological decline characterized by generalized dystonia and dysphagia. She was admitted to the ICU for airway protection and management of the "dystonic storm" with benzodiazepines and anticholinergics. Her chelation regimen was adjusted, and she eventually required a PEG tube for nutrition during her slow recovery.

wilsons_disease_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Wilson's Disease with Normal Ceruloplasmin
  presenting_complaint: Persistent tremors and elevated LFTs
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female presented with a diagnostic challenge; she had classic neurological symptoms but a serum ceruloplasmin within the low-normal range (0.21 g/L). Because she had concurrent systemic inflammation (high CRP), the ceruloplasmin was falsely elevated as an acute phase reactant. A liver biopsy confirmed a high copper concentration, and genetic testing identified two pathogenic ATP7B variants.

wilsons_disease_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Haemolytic Anaemia-led Wilson's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of jaundice and dark urine
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old male had three episodes of Coombs-negative haemolytic anaemia over two years, initially misdiagnosed as G6PD deficiency. During the fourth episode, mild splenomegaly and low ceruloplasmin were noted. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease was confirmed, illustrating that recurrent haemolysis can precede overt liver or neurological symptoms.

wilsons_disease_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Wilson's Disease with Comorbid NAFLD
  presenting_complaint: Weight gain and right upper quadrant discomfort
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old obese male with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) showed disproportionately high transaminases. An extended workup revealed a low ceruloplasmin and high 24-hour urinary copper. He was managed for both Wilson's disease (trientine) and NAFLD (weight loss and diet), highlighting the importance of screening for Wilson's even when a common cause of liver disease is present.

wilsons_disease_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Neuropsychiatric Wilson's Disease (Cognitive Decline)
  presenting_complaint: Deteriorating school performance and social withdrawal
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old student previously at the top of his class began failing exams and exhibiting aggressive behaviour. Initial assessment focused on adolescent mental health, but a physical exam noted a new-onset "sardonic smile" (risus sardonicus). Investigations confirmed Wilson's disease, and copper chelation therapy halted his cognitive decline, though he required significant educational support to regain his baseline.

wilsons_disease_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-Transplant Wilson's Disease Management
  presenting_complaint: Routine follow-up 5 years post-liver transplant
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female who received a liver transplant for fulminant Wilson's disease at age 24 attended her annual review. Her copper metabolism had been restored by the donor liver, and she no longer required chelation therapy. Her KF rings had completely disappeared, and she remained on standard immunosuppression with normal graft function.
