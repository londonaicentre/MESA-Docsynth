He had a small puncture wound over the third MCP joint with significant surrounding cellulitis and restricted movement. He was admitted for IV Co-amoxiclav and surgical debridement to rule out septic arthritis, as human bites are prone to Eikenella corrodens infection.

  primary_diagnosis: Flail chest
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath and severe chest wall pain.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male was repeatedly kicked in the chest during a mugging. Clinical examination revealed paradoxical chest wall movement on the right side, and CT confirmed fractures of ribs 4-8 in two or more places. He required ICU admission for thoracic epidural analgesia and non-invasive ventilation to manage respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary contusion.

assault_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
  presenting_complaint: Flashbacks, hypervigilance, and insomnia.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female presented to her GP six months after a violent domestic assault.

  primary_diagnosis: Traumatic asphyxiation
  presenting_complaint: Neck pain, hoarseness, and petechial rash.
