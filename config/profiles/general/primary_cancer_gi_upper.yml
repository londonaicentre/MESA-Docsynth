The tumour showed complete regression following H. pylori eradication therapy and close endoscopic follow-up.

primary_cancer_gi_upper_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Advanced oesophageal SCC with tracheo-oesophageal fistula
  presenting_complaint: Severe coughing after swallowing and recurrent pneumonia
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with advanced mid-oesophageal SCC presented acutely with aspiration pneumonia. Investigations confirmed a tracheo-oesophageal fistula caused by local tumour invasion. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory support and underwent urgent insertion of a covered oesophageal metal stent to seal the fistula.

primary_cancer_gi_upper_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Gastric outlet obstruction secondary to antral cancer
  presenting_complaint: Projectile vomiting of undigested food
  summary_of_course: A 76-year-old male presented with severe metabolic alkalosis and dehydration due to persistent vomiting. OGD showed a near-complete obstruction of the pylorus by a bulky antral mass. After nutritional optimisation with TPN, he underwent a palliative gastrojejunostomy to bypass the obstruction.

primary_cancer_gi_upper_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Early gastric cancer (Type 0-IIc)
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic; found during screening for anaemia
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female with microcytic anaemia underwent OGD which revealed a subtle, slightly depressed mucosal lesion in the gastric body. Histology confirmed intramucosal adenocarcinoma (T1a). Due to the low risk of node metastasis, she was successfully treated with endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) with clear margins.

primary_cancer_gi_upper_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma (Krukenberg tumour)
  presenting_complaint: Increasing abdominal girth and pelvic pain
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female presented with bilateral adnexal masses on ultrasound. Subsequent CT and OGD identified a primary signet-ring cell carcinoma of the stomach that had metastasised to the ovaries. She was started on palliative chemotherapy (FOLFOX) and referred to the palliative care team for symptom management.

primary_cancer_gi_upper_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Adenocarcinoma of the gastro-oesophageal junction (Siewert Type II)
  presenting_complaint: Dysphagia and retrosternal "sticking" sensation
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male presented with symptoms localised to the cardia. OGD and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) confirmed a Siewert Type II adenocarcinoma involving the GOJ. He completed the CROSS trial protocol (neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy) followed by an extended total gastrectomy and distal oesophagectomy.

primary_cancer_gi_upper_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Duodenal bulb adenocarcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Epigastric pain mimicking peptic ulcer disease
  summary_of_course: A 73-year-old male presented with chronic upper abdominal pain initially attributed to a duodenal ulcer. Repeat endoscopy after 8 weeks of PPI showed no healing; deeper biopsies revealed a primary duodenal adenocarcinoma. Staging showed no distant spread, and he underwent a successful pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy.

primary_cancer_gi_upper_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Upper oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Hoarseness and a lump in the neck
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male heavy drinker presented with persistent hoarseness and a palpable left supraclavicular lymph node (Virchow's node). OGD identified a lesion 18cm from the incisors, and laryngoscopy confirmed recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy due to local invasion. He was staged as T4N2M0 and managed with palliative radiotherapy and a feeding gastrostomy.

primary_cancer_gi_upper_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Gastric fundus adenocarcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Lethargy and occult blood in stool
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including heart failure and COPD, was investigated for symptomatic anaemia. OGD identified a large polypoid mass in the gastric fundus. Given his significant frailty and high surgical risk, the MDT recommendation was for best supportive care and iron transfusions.

primary_cancer_gi_upper_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent oesophageal adenocarcinoma
  presenting_complaint: New onset dysphagia 18 months post-surgery
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male who previously underwent an Ivor Lewis oesophagectomy for T3N1 disease presented with recurrent swallowing difficulties. Endoscopy confirmed a recurrence at the anastomotic site. He was treated with palliative oesophageal stenting and second-line systemic chemotherapy (Paclitaxel/Ramucirumab).

primary_cancer_gi_upper_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Perforated gastric malignancy
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset, generalised "board-like" abdominal pain
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old male presented to A&E with clinical signs of peritonitis. An erect chest X-ray showed free air under the diaphragm. Emergency laparotomy revealed a perforated malignant ulcer in the prepyloric region; a distal gastrectomy was performed as an emergency procedure, and pathology confirmed a T4a adenocarcinoma.

primary_cancer_gi_upper_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Gastric neuroendocrine tumour (NET) Type 1
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding during OGD for pernicious anaemia
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female with known autoimmune atrophic gastritis underwent surveillance OGD. Multiple small, yellowish subepithelial nodules were seen in the body and fundus. Biopsies confirmed Grade 1 NETs (Type 1) associated with hypergastrinaemia; these were managed with endoscopic resection and ongoing 12-monthly surveillance.

primary_cancer_gi_upper_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Oesophageal cancer with stent migration complication
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent dysphagia and severe retrosternal discomfort
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old male with inoperable oesophageal SCC had a self-expanding metal stent (SEMS) placed 4 weeks prior. He presented with a return of dysphagia; imaging showed the stent had migrated distally into the stomach. The migrated stent was retrieved endoscopically, and a new, larger-diameter flared stent was deployed to secure the airway and food passage.

primary_cancer_gi_upper_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Gastric adenocarcinoma with Virchow's node metastasis
  presenting_complaint: Left-sided neck swelling and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male presented with a painless lump in the left supraclavicular fossa. FNA of the node showed metastatic adenocarcinoma, and a subsequent OGD identified a primary tumour in the gastric body. PET-CT confirmed extensive lymphatic spread, and he was commenced on palliative chemotherapy with Herceptin due to HER2-positive status.
