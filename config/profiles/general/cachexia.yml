cachexia_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Cancer-associated cachexia
  presenting_complaint: Progressive weight loss and profound weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer presents with a 15% involuntary weight loss over three months. Clinical examination reveals temporal wasting and reduced mid-arm muscle circumference, with bloods showing an albumin of 28 g/L and elevated CRP. He was diagnosed with severe cancer cachexia and commenced on a multimodal regimen of nutritional support and dexamethasone.

cachexia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Cardiac cachexia
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath and loss of muscle mass.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with long-standing NYHA Class IV heart failure presents with chronic wasting despite significant peripheral oedema. Despite optimal medical therapy for HFrEF, her BMI has dropped to 18.5 kg/m2 with visible sarcopenia. This chronic cardiac cachexia is managed with high-protein oral nutritional supplements and supervised resistance exercise.

cachexia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Pulmonary cachexia
  presenting_complaint: Increased breathlessness and inability to maintain weight.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with GOLD Stage IV COPD presents with a BMI of 16.2 kg/m2 and significant loss of fat-free mass. Investigations show systemic inflammation and a low creatinine height index, confirming pulmonary cachexia. He is managed in the outpatient setting with long-term oxygen therapy and calorie-dense nutritional pulmonary rehabilitation.

cachexia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric cachexia secondary to Cystic Fibrosis
  presenting_complaint: Failure to thrive and recurrent respiratory infections.
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old girl with Cystic Fibrosis presents with weight falling below the 2nd centile and significant muscle atrophy. Despite pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, malabsorption and chronic inflammation have led to paediatric cachexia. She required admission for nasogastric feeding and intensive physiotherapy to address acute-on-chronic decline.

cachexia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: HIV-associated wasting syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Chronic diarrhoea and unintentional weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male with poorly controlled HIV (CD4 count 120 cells/uL) presents with a 12% weight loss and persistent fevers. Clinical assessment confirms HIV-associated cachexia, exacerbated by opportunistic gastrointestinal infections. Treatment involved initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) and aggressive nutritional supplementation, resulting in partial weight stabilisation.

cachexia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Renal cachexia
  presenting_complaint: Lethargy and loss of appetite in a dialysis patient.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female with Stage 5 CKD on haemodialysis presents with progressive muscle wasting and a decline in dry weight. Laboratory markers show persistent hypoalbuminaemia and metabolic acidosis, consistent with renal cachexia (protein-energy wasting). Management includes intradialytic parenteral nutrition and adjustments to her dialysis prescription.

cachexia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory cancer cachexia
  presenting_complaint: Total loss of appetite and inability to mobilise.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with terminal pancreatic adenocarcinoma presents with life-threatening wasting and a pro-inflammatory state (CRP 110 mg/L). He has failed to respond to prokinetic agents and megestrol acetate, with a performance status of ECOG 4. The multidisciplinary team shifted focus to palliative symptom control as the cachexia was deemed refractory to further nutritional intervention.

cachexia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Rheumatoid cachexia
  presenting_complaint: Joint pain and noticeable loss of muscle bulk in the limbs.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with high-titre Rheumatoid Arthritis presents with significant loss of lean body mass despite a stable BMI of 24 kg/m2. DEXA scan confirms a low fat-free mass index, diagnosing rheumatoid cachexia driven by TNF-alpha mediated proteolysis. Treatment was escalated to biological DMARDs to suppress systemic inflammation and preserve muscle function.

cachexia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: ICU-acquired cachexia
  presenting_complaint: Profound generalised weakness following prolonged ventilation.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male spent four weeks in the ICU for septic shock and multi-organ failure. Upon step-down, he demonstrated acute cachexia with a 20kg loss of body mass, primarily muscle, due to the hypermetabolic state of critical illness. He underwent an intensive 6-month rehabilitation programme involving speech and language therapy and high-protein enteral feeding.

cachexia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Cachexia secondary to Crohn's disease
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal pain, frequent stools, and weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male with fistulating Crohn's disease presents with subacute cachexia and severe vitamin deficiencies. Despite a high-calorie diet, systemic inflammation and malabsorption prevented weight gain. He was treated with infliximab and exclusive enteral nutrition, which successfully induced remission and reversed the cachectic state.

cachexia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Sarcopenic cachexia of ageing
  presenting_complaint: Frequent falls and general frailty.
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old female living in the community presents with gradual weight loss and an inability to perform activities of daily living. Clinical evaluation identified "anorexia of ageing" alongside sarcopenic cachexia, with a BMI of 19.1 kg/m2. Management involved social care support, vitamin D supplementation, and community-based dietetic input.

cachexia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Hepatic cachexia
  presenting_complaint: Increasing abdominal girth but thinning of arms and legs.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh C) presents with gross ascites that masks severe muscle wasting. Mid-arm muscle circumference was below the 5th centile, confirming hepatic cachexia. He was managed with a low-sodium, high-protein diet and nocturnal branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplements while awaiting transplant assessment.

cachexia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Neurogenic cachexia in Motor Neurone Disease
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty swallowing and rapid weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old female with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) presents with bulbar symptoms and a 10% weight loss over two months. The combination of dysphagia and a hypermetabolic state led to neurogenic cachexia. Early insertion of a Radiologically Inserted Gastrostomy (RIG) tube was performed to provide nutritional support and slow the progression of wasting.

cachexia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcohol-related cachexia
  presenting_complaint: Severe malnutrition and gait instability.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male with chronic alcohol dependency presents with a BMI of 15.8 kg/m2 and signs of Wernicke's encephalopathy. Chronic ethanol consumption and poor oral intake resulted in severe cachexia and multiple micronutrient deficiencies. He was admitted for medically supervised withdrawal, IV Pabrinex, and a slow refeeding protocol to avoid refeeding syndrome.

cachexia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Cachexia secondary to chronic osteomyelitis
  presenting_complaint: Non-healing leg ulcer and progressive weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with chronic refractory osteomyelitis of the tibia presents with a persistent systemic inflammatory response. The chronic infection induced a state of cachexia, with a loss of 8kg over six months and normocytic anaemia of chronic disease. Treatment required surgical debridement and long-term antibiotics to resolve the underlying cause of the cachectic state.

cachexia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Pre-cachexia in Oesophageal Cancer
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty swallowing solids and mild weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male with newly diagnosed T2N0 oesophageal adenocarcinoma presents with a 4% weight loss and anorexia. While not yet meeting full criteria for cachexia, he was diagnosed with pre-cachexia due to the high risk of rapid decline. Early dietetic intervention and stenting were initiated alongside neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

cachexia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Cachexia in Multi-System Atrophy
  presenting_complaint: Autonomic symptoms and unexplained weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old female with Multi-System Atrophy (MSA) presents with rapid weight loss despite adequate caloric intake. This rare presentation of neurogenic cachexia is thought to be related to hypothalamic dysfunction and autonomic failure. Management is supportive, focusing on calorie-dense foods and monitoring for aspiration pneumonia.

cachexia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Complicated cachexia with pressure ulcers
  presenting_complaint: Immobile patient with non-healing skin breakdown.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with advanced dementia and severe cachexia presents with multiple Grade 4 sacral pressure ulcers. His BMI is 14.5 kg/m2, and his serum albumin is 19 g/L, indicating a profound failure of protein synthesis. Despite intensive wound care and high-protein supplements, his prognosis remains poor due to the severity of the wasting and underlying frailty.

cachexia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric cachexia in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Stunted growth and muscle thinning in a teenager.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old male with polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) presents with significant growth retardation and muscle wasting. Chronic elevation of IL-6 has driven a cachectic state, preventing normal pubertal development. Escalation to anti-IL-6 therapy (tocilizumab) resulted in improved appetite and a gradual increase in lean body mass.

cachexia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Cachexia secondary to Short Bowel Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: High-output stoma and extreme weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female post-extensive small bowel resection for mesenteric ischaemia presents with life-threatening cachexia. With only 50cm of viable bowel remaining, she suffered from severe malabsorption and a BMI of 14.0 kg/m2. She was stabilised with long-term Home Parenteral Nutrition (HPN), which is now her primary source of hydration and nutrients to manage her chronic cachexia.
