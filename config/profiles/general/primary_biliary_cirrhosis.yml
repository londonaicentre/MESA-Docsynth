  primary_diagnosis: Primary Biliary Cirrhosis
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of deranged liver function tests.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female was found to have an isolated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 450 U/L during routine screening. Subsequent investigations revealed a positive anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA) titre of 1:640 and normal bilirubin. She was diagnosed with early-stage primary biliary cirrhosis and commenced on ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), showing a biochemical response at six months.

  primary_diagnosis: Primary Biliary Cirrhosis
  presenting_complaint: Severe generalised pruritus and fatigue.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old woman presented with intractable itching, worse at night, and significant lethargy. Examination revealed excoriations but no jaundice; bloods showed ALP 680 U/L and GGT 320 U/L with positive AMA. She was diagnosed with moderate primary biliary cirrhosis and started on UDCA and colestyramine for symptomatic relief of pruritus.

  presenting_complaint: Increasing abdominal girth and ankle swelling.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old woman with a 15-year history of primary biliary cirrhosis presented with decompensated liver disease. Clinical examination confirmed gross ascites and bilateral pitting oedema. Despite maximal UDCA therapy, her bilirubin has risen to 120 µmol/L, and she is now being assessed for liver transplantation.

primary_biliary_cirrhosis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: AMA-negative Primary Biliary Cirrhosis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent lethargy and raised cholestatic enzymes.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female presented with chronic fatigue and a persistently raised ALP of 400 U/L, but repeatedly negative AMA testing. A liver biopsy was performed, demonstrating florid duct lesions and granulomatous cholangitis consistent with primary biliary cirrhosis. She was successfully managed with UDCA despite the atypical serology.

primary_biliary_cirrhosis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary Biliary Cirrhosis with Refractory Pruritus
  presenting_complaint: Disabling pruritus unresponsive to first-line agents.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old patient with established primary biliary cirrhosis reported suicidal ideation due to sleep deprivation from severe itching. She had failed treatment with colestyramine, rifampicin, and naltrexone. She was admitted for a trial of plasmapheresis, which provided temporary symptomatic relief while her UDCA dose was optimised.

This case represents a multi-system autoimmune presentation involving both the biliary tree and connective tissue.

primary_biliary_cirrhosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary Biliary Cirrhosis with UDCA Non-response
  presenting_complaint: Worsening cholestasis despite treatment.
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old woman with primary biliary cirrhosis remained at high risk according to Paris II criteria after 12 months of UDCA at 13-15mg/kg. Her ALP remained >1.5x the upper limit of normal. Obeticholic acid was added to her regimen as a second-line agent, resulting in a significant reduction in ALP levels over the following year.

  primary_diagnosis: Primary Biliary Cirrhosis with Osteoporotic Fracture
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset back pain after lifting.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female with long-standing primary biliary cirrhosis presented with a vertebral compression fracture.

  presenting_complaint: Fever and diffuse abdominal pain.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female with known primary biliary cirrhosis and ascites was admitted with acute confusion and pyrexia. Paracentesis revealed a neutrophilic count >250 cells/mm³, confirming spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. She was treated with intravenous cefotaxime and albumin, following which her encephalopathy resolved.

  presenting_complaint: Jaundice and confusion following a urinary tract infection.
  summary_of_course: A 57-year-old woman with stable primary biliary cirrhosis developed sepsis from a UTI, leading to rapid clinical deterioration. She developed Grade II hepatic encephalopathy and worsening coagulopathy (INR 2.1). She was managed in the High Dependency Unit with antibiotics and lactulose, eventually returning to her baseline liver function.

  primary_diagnosis: Primary Biliary Cirrhosis with Malabsorption
  presenting_complaint: Steatorrhoea and weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with advanced primary biliary cirrhosis presented with pale, oily stools and significant weight loss. Investigations confirmed fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies (A, D, E, and K) due to chronic bile salt deficiency. She required aggressive oral and parenteral vitamin supplementation alongside UDCA therapy.

  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent Primary Biliary Cirrhosis Post-Transplant
  presenting_complaint: Rising ALP five years after liver transplantation.
  summary_of_course: A 56-year-old woman who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation for end-stage primary biliary cirrhosis showed a gradual rise in cholestatic enzymes. Protocol biopsy confirmed recurrence of primary biliary cirrhosis in the graft. She was recommenced on UDCA, which successfully stabilised her liver biochemistry.

  presenting_complaint: Reduced urine output and increasing jaundice.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female with decompensated primary biliary cirrhosis was admitted to ICU with a creatinine rise to 210 µmol/L and minimal response to fluid resuscitation. After excluding other causes, hepatorenal syndrome was diagnosed. She was treated with terlipressin and albumin as a bridge to urgent liver transplant assessment.

primary_biliary_cirrhosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary Biliary Cirrhosis with Xanthomata
  presenting_complaint: Yellowish skin deposits on eyelids and palms.
  summary_of_course: A 47-year-old woman presented with xanthelasma and tuberous xanthomata. Blood tests showed profound hypercholesterolaemia (Total cholesterol 12.5 mmol/L) and a cholestatic liver profile with positive AMA. She was diagnosed with primary biliary cirrhosis, and the skin lesions partially regressed following the initiation of UDCA and lipid-lowering therapy.

  primary_diagnosis: Primary Biliary Cirrhosis with Coeliac Disease
  presenting_complaint: Chronic diarrhoea and iron-deficiency anaemia.
  summary_of_course: A 46-year-old female with known primary biliary cirrhosis presented with worsening bowel habit and microcytic anaemia. Serology for anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) was strongly positive, and duodenal biopsy confirmed Marsh 3b changes. This case highlights the association between primary biliary cirrhosis and other gluten-sensitive enteropathies.

  presenting_complaint: Deep jaundice and intractable pruritus.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female presented with rapidly progressive primary biliary cirrhosis, with bilirubin rising to 350 µmol/L within months of diagnosis. She failed to respond to UDCA and developed signs of early liver failure. She was prioritised for an urgent liver transplant and successfully underwent the procedure three weeks after listing.
