  presenting_complaint: Episodic dizziness associated with sensitivity to light and sound.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old female with a long history of menstrual migraines reported recurrent spontaneous vertigo lasting minutes to hours. Neurological and vestibular examinations were normal between episodes. She was diagnosed with vestibular migraine and saw significant improvement following the initiation of propranolol as a prophylactic agent and dietary trigger avoidance.

dizziness_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Vestibular Schwannoma
  presenting_complaint: Progressive imbalance over two years and worsening hearing loss in the right ear.
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male presented with a slow-onset "unsteadiness" rather than true vertigo. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the internal auditory meatuses revealed a 1.8cm mass on the right vestibulocochlear nerve. Given the size and symptoms, he was referred for stereotactic radiosurgery (Gamma Knife) and remains under annual radiological surveillance.

dizziness_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Persistent Postural-Perceptual Dizziness (PPPD)
  presenting_complaint: Constant feeling of swaying or being on a boat, worse in busy environments like supermarkets.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female developed chronic dizziness following an initial bout of labyrinthitis six months prior. Despite normal vestibular function tests and MRI, her symptoms persisted and caused significant anxiety. She was diagnosed with PPPD and responded well to a combination of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and a low-dose SSRI (sertraline).

dizziness_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Carbon Monoxide Poisoning
  presenting_complaint: Sudden headache, dizziness, and nausea affecting several family members.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male and his two children presented to the emergency department with non-specific neurological symptoms. Arterial blood gas analysis showed a carboxyhaemoglobin level of 14%. The local fire service identified a faulty gas boiler in their home, and all patients were treated with 100% high-flow oxygen until levels normalised.

dizziness_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Vertebrobasilar Insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Brief episodes of dizziness and visual blurring when extending the neck to look upwards.
  summary_of_course: A 76-year-old female with known atherosclerosis reported transient dizziness when hanging laundry. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showed significant stenosis of the left vertebral artery. She was managed conservatively with optimized antiplatelet therapy and statins, and advised to avoid extreme neck extension.

dizziness_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Gentamicin-Induced Ototoxicity
  presenting_complaint: Severe oscillopsia (bouncing vision) and inability to walk in the dark.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male was treated with a prolonged course of intravenous gentamicin for a complex urosepsis in the ICU. Following discharge, he complained that his vision "jumped" whenever he moved his head. Video head-impulse testing (vHIT) confirmed bilateral vestibular loss, and he required long-term intensive vestibular physiotherapy for gait stabilisation.

dizziness_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Superior Semicircular Canal Dehiscence (SSCD)
  presenting_complaint: Vertigo triggered by loud noises and hearing her own heartbeat in her ear.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented with the "Tullio phenomenon," where loud music induced immediate dizziness. High-resolution CT of the temporal bones revealed a small bony defect in the superior semicircular canal. She underwent a successful surgical repair via a middle cranial fossa approach, which resolved both the autophony and the sound-induced vertigo.
