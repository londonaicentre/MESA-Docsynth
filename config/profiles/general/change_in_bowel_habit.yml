  presenting_complaint: Six-month history of alternating constipation and diarrhoea with rectal bleeding.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male presented to his GP with a persistent change in bowel habit and 8kg unexplained weight loss. Blood tests revealed a microcytic anaemia (Hb 92g/L) and a colonoscopy identified a stenosing lesion in the sigmoid colon. Histopathology confirmed adenocarcinoma, and the patient was referred for an urgent anterior resection and adjuvant chemotherapy.

change_in_bowel_habit_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Ulcerative Colitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe bloody diarrhoea, up to 12 times per day, with nocturnal symptoms.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female was admitted to the gastroenterology ward with a two-week history of worsening bloody stools and tenesmus. Investigations showed a faecal calprotectin of 1850µg/g and flexible sigmoidoscopy confirmed Mayo Grade 3 inflammation. She was treated with intravenous hydrocortisone and transitioned to infliximab after failing to respond to oral mesalazine.

change_in_bowel_habit_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS-M)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic fluctuating bowel habit with abdominal bloating and relief upon defecation.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female reported a three-year history of alternating bouts of constipation and loose stools, often triggered by stress. Extensive investigations, including coeliac serology and a colonoscopy, were entirely normal. She was managed in the community with a low FODMAP diet and peppermint oil capsules, showing moderate improvement in symptoms.

change_in_bowel_habit_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Clostridioides difficile Infection
  presenting_complaint: Profuse, watery diarrhoea and lower abdominal cramping.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male developed severe diarrhoea five days after completing a course of co-amoxiclav for a chest infection. Stool PCR was positive for C. difficile toxin, and he was started on oral vancomycin. Despite initial treatment, he suffered a recurrence three weeks later requiring a prolonged fidaxomicin taper.

change_in_bowel_habit_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Diverticulitis
  presenting_complaint: Left iliac fossa pain and recent onset of constipation.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented to A&E with acute-onset abdominal pain and a failure to pass stool for three days. A CT abdomen/pelvis demonstrated sigmoid diverticulitis with localized wall thickening and fat stranding but no perforation. He was managed successfully with intravenous fluids and antibiotics before being discharged with dietary advice.

change_in_bowel_habit_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Coeliac Disease
  presenting_complaint: Chronic loose stools, abdominal distension, and failure to thrive.
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old boy was referred to paediatric gastroenterology due to persistent diarrhoea and poor height velocity. Serology showed highly elevated anti-TTG IgA levels, and duodenal biopsies confirmed Marsh 3c villous atrophy. After six months on a strict gluten-free diet, his bowel habit normalized and his growth trajectory improved.

change_in_bowel_habit_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Ischaemic Colitis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset severe abdominal pain followed by a large volume of bright red rectal bleeding.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation presented in shock with acute abdominal distress. Urgent CT angiography showed reduced perfusion to the splenic flexure, and she was admitted to the ICU for supportive care. Fortunately, the ischaemia was non-gangrenous, and she recovered with conservative management and optimization of her cardiovascular status.

change_in_bowel_habit_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Faecal Impaction with Overflow Diarrhoea
  presenting_complaint: Constant "leaking" of liquid stool and abdominal discomfort.
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old male with advanced dementia was brought from his care home due to suspected infectious diarrhoea. Digital rectal examination revealed a large mass of hard stool in the rectum, indicating that the liquid stool was bypassing the impaction. He required a combination of manual evacuation and a high-dose macrogol regimen to resolve the obstruction.

change_in_bowel_habit_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Terminal Ileal Crohn's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Subacute right-sided abdominal pain and frequent non-bloody loose stools.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male presented with a four-month history of lethargy and four loose stools daily. An MRI enterography revealed transmural inflammation and narrowing of the terminal ileum, consistent with Crohn's disease. He was started on budesonide for induction of remission and azathioprine for maintenance therapy.

change_in_bowel_habit_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Lactose Intolerance
  presenting_complaint: Bloating, flatulence, and explosive diarrhoea following dairy consumption.
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old male student noticed a pattern of gastrointestinal upset occurring approximately two hours after eating cereal or pizza. A hydrogen breath test confirmed lactose malabsorption. His symptoms completely resolved upon switching to a lactose-free diet and using lactase enzyme supplements when eating out.

change_in_bowel_habit_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Opioid-Induced Constipation
  presenting_complaint: Severe constipation and infrequent, hard stools.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male began experiencing significant difficulty passing stools following a total hip replacement, during which he was prescribed high-dose oxycodone. Despite using over-the-counter stimulant laxatives, he remained symptomatic for two weeks. He eventually required the addition of naloxegol, a peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist, to restore regular bowel function.

change_in_bowel_habit_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Collagenous Colitis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic, watery, non-bloody diarrhoea (6-8 episodes per day).
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female underwent a colonoscopy for persistent diarrhoea, which appeared macroscopically normal. However, random colonic biopsies revealed a thickened subepithelial collagen band, confirming a diagnosis of microscopic (collagenous) colitis. She responded well to a tapering course of oral budesonide and the discontinuation of her NSAID medication.

change_in_bowel_habit_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Toxic Megacolon
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal distension, fever, and cessation of bowel movements during a colitis flare.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male with known ulcerative colitis was admitted with a severe flare that rapidly progressed to systemic toxicity. An abdominal X-ray showed a transverse colon diameter of 7.5cm, and he was transferred to the ICU. Despite aggressive medical management with ciclosporin, he required an emergency subtotal colectomy and end ileostomy due to impending perforation.

change_in_bowel_habit_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Giardiasis
  presenting_complaint: Foul-smelling, greasy stools and significant bloating for three weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male returned from a backpacking trip in South Asia and developed persistent steatorrhoea and weight loss. Stool microscopy identified Giardia lamblia cysts after three separate samples were submitted. He was treated with a single dose of tinidazole, which resulted in a rapid and complete resolution of his symptoms.

change_in_bowel_habit_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Bowel Endometriosis
  presenting_complaint: Cyclic rectal pain and constipation coinciding with menstruation.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old female complained of painful defecation and a change in bowel habit that occurred only during her periods. Previous investigations for IBS were inconclusive, but a specialized pelvic MRI identified an endometriotic nodule infiltrating the anterior wall of the rectum. She was managed by a multidisciplinary team involving gynaecology and colorectal surgery for laparoscopic excision.

change_in_bowel_habit_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic bloating and diarrhoea following gastric bypass surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with a history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass presented with worsening flatulence and loose stools. A glucose hydrogen breath test was positive, suggesting bacterial overgrowth in the redundant limb of the small bowel. She was treated with a 14-day course of rifaximin, which significantly reduced her symptoms, although she required periodic retreatment.

change_in_bowel_habit_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Bile Acid Malabsorption
  presenting_complaint: Urgent, watery, yellow-coloured diarrhoea, particularly after fatty meals.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female reported a change in bowel habit following her cholecystectomy two years prior. A SeHCAT scan showed 4% retention at seven days, confirming severe bile acid malabsorption. She was started on colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, which successfully controlled her urgency and stool consistency.

change_in_bowel_habit_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Hirschsprung Disease
  presenting_complaint: Failure to pass meconium within 48 hours and progressive abdominal distension.
  summary_of_course: A 2-week-old male infant was admitted to the neonatal unit with vomiting and a lack of bowel movements. A contrast enema showed a transition zone in the rectosigmoid, and a rectal suction biopsy confirmed the absence of ganglion cells. He underwent a Soave pull-through procedure at three months of age with good functional results.

change_in_bowel_habit_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Colonic Pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's)
  presenting_complaint: Massive abdominal distension and obstipation following spinal surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male developed a severely distended abdomen four days post-laminectomy. Imaging showed massive colonic dilatation without a mechanical cause, and he failed to respond to conservative measures. He was successfully treated with intravenous neostigmine under cardiac monitoring, which prompted immediate colonic decompression.

change_in_bowel_habit_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Radiation Proctitis
  presenting_complaint: Rectal urgency, mucus discharge, and frequent small-volume stools.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male presented with a change in bowel habit eighteen months after completing radiotherapy for prostate cancer. Endoscopy revealed friable, telangiectatic mucosa in the rectum consistent with radiation damage. He was managed with sucralfate enemas and argon plasma coagulation (APC) to control intermittent rectal bleeding.
