  primary_diagnosis: Stevens-Johnson Syndrome with Pulmonary Complications
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath and blistering skin rash.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female developed SJS secondary to phenobarbital. During her hospital stay, she developed progressive respiratory distress. Bronchoscopy revealed bronchial epithelial sloughing, a rare but severe complication. She required mechanical ventilation and intensive pulmonary toilet in the ICU, eventually recovering after a 3-week stay.

stevens_johnson_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (Acute-on-chronic presentation)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrence of skin pain and new blisters.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with a history of SJS to sulfonamides was accidentally prescribed a related compound for a minor infection. He presented with rapid-onset mucosal reactivation and new bullae (7% BSA). Due to prior sensitisation, the reaction was more accelerated than his first episode. He was treated with Etanercept (TNF-alpha inhibitor) with rapid cessation of skin detachment.

stevens_johnson_syndrome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (Modafinil-induced)
  presenting_complaint: Rash on palms and soles with mouth sores.
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old medical student used modafinil for narcolepsy. He developed painful acral erythema and oral erosions within 10 days.

  primary_diagnosis: Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (Nevirapine-induced)
  presenting_complaint: Severe rash and bleeding from the gums.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male in an outpatient HIV clinic began nevirapine. Within 14 days, he developed a temperature of 39.5°C and haemorrhagic crusting of the lips. Skin detachment involved 5% BSA. He was admitted and switched to an alternative antiretroviral regimen; his SJS resolved with supportive care and topical emollients.

stevens_johnson_syndrome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (Fluconazole-induced)
  presenting_complaint: Painful blisters on the trunk and genitals.
  summary_of_course: A 47-year-old female took a single dose of fluconazole for candidiasis. She subsequently developed SJS with 4% BSA involvement and significant vaginal mucosal erosions. Management focused on preventing vaginal synechiae using topical steroid ointments and dilators. The patient recovered but required long-term gynaecological follow-up.

stevens_johnson_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (Check-point inhibitor induced)
  presenting_complaint: Generalised skin pain and oral ulceration.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with metastatic melanoma on Pembrolizumab developed a delayed-onset SJS-like reaction (7% BSA). Unlike drug-induced cases with short half-lives, the immune-mediated nature required prolonged high-dose prednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil. His lesions took several weeks to stabilise, highlighting the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of immunotherapy-related SJS.
