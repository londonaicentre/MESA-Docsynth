  primary_diagnosis: Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation with Mitral Stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Worsening dyspnoea on exertion
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with a history of rheumatic fever presented with reduced exercise tolerance. Echocardiography revealed moderate mitral stenosis and left atrial enlargement. He experienced frequent paroxysms of AF, necessitating Warfarin (rather than a DOAC) due to the valvular nature of the disease.

paroxysmal_atrial_fibrillation_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Silent Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Irregular pulse detected during routine flu vaccination
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old asymptomatic male was found to have an irregular pulse by the practice nurse. A subsequent 7-day tape showed multiple episodes of AF, the longest being 12 hours. Despite being asymptomatic, his CHA2DS2-VASc score of 3 dictated the initiation of Apixaban.
