  primary_diagnosis: Fusidic acid-resistant impetigo
  presenting_complaint: Persistent facial sores despite topical treatment.
  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old female returned to the clinic after 7 days of topical fusidic acid with no improvement in her facial lesions. Repeat swabs demonstrated S. aureus resistant to fusidic acid but sensitive to mupirocin. Switching to topical mupirocin led to rapid clearance of the crusting.

impetigo_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Impetigo secondary to scabies
  presenting_complaint: Widespread itchy rash with secondary infection.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male presented with intense nocturnal pruritus and excoriated papules in the finger webs, complicated by areas of yellow crusting on the wrists.

impetigo_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Facial impetigo with secondary cellulitis
  presenting_complaint: Swollen, red, and painful cheek following a skin sore.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented with a honey-crusted lesion near her nose, surrounded by a rapidly spreading area of warm, tender erythema and facial swelling. She was febrile (38.5°C) with a raised CRP (85 mg/L). She was diagnosed with impetigo-related cellulitis and treated with IV flucloxacillin followed by an oral course.

impetigo_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Atypical impetigo in an immunocompromised patient
  presenting_complaint: Non-healing erosions on the scalp and forehead.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male undergoing chemotherapy for CLL presented with persistent, shallow erosions that failed to crust typically. Initial suspicion was herpetic, but swabs confirmed heavy growth of S. aureus. Because of his neutropenia, he was treated aggressively with IV vancomycin until sensitivities were available, eventually switching to oral linezolid.

impetigo_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Bullous impetigo of the hands
  presenting_complaint: Multiple blisters on the palms and fingers.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old nursery teacher presented with painful bullae on her hands. She reported several children in her class had "cold sores" and skin rashes. Clinical examination showed classic bullous impetigo. She was treated with oral flucloxacillin and advised on strict hand hygiene and exclusion from work until the lesions had crusted over.

impetigo_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent impetigo due to nasal carriage
  presenting_complaint: Frequent outbreaks of sores around the nostrils.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy suffered from five episodes of non-bullous impetigo in six months. Nasal swabs of the patient and his parents identified S. aureus carriage in the father and the child.

  presenting_complaint: Oozing and crusting on a chronically swollen leg.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with chronic venous insufficiency presented with an acute change in her leg rash, featuring golden crusts and increased exudate. Distinguishing between a simple eczema flare and impetiginisation was difficult, but swabs confirmed S. aureus. She was treated with a combination of topical mupirocin and optimized compression bandaging.

impetigo_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Perianal streptococcal impetigo
  presenting_complaint: Bright red, itchy rash around the anus.
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old male was brought in with perianal itching and painful defecation. Examination showed a well-demarcated erythematous plaque with some minor honey-coloured crusting at the periphery. A perianal swab was positive for Streptococcus pyogenes, and the condition resolved after a 10-day course of oral phenoxymethylpenicillin.
