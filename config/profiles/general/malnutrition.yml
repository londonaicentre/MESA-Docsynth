malnutrition_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe malnutrition with refeeding syndrome risk
  presenting_complaint: Confusion and ataxia in the context of chronic alcohol excess
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with chronic alcohol dependence syndrome presented with cachexia and signs of Wernicke's encephalopathy. Initial bloods showed profound hypophosphataemia and hypomagnesaemia upon starting enteral nutrition. He required IV Pabrinex and cautious electrolyte replacement under a strict refeeding protocol to prevent cardiovascular collapse.

malnutrition_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Malabsorption-related malnutrition
  presenting_complaint: Steatorrhoea and failure to thrive
  summary_of_course: A 9-year-old girl with cystic fibrosis presented with significant weight loss and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies (A, D, E, K). Despite high-calorie intake, her BMI centile had dropped from the 50th to the 2nd. Management involved optimising pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) and introducing nocturnal enteral tube feeding to achieve catch-up growth.

malnutrition_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe malnutrition secondary to Anorexia Nervosa
  presenting_complaint: Bradycardia and extreme lethargy
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female was admitted to a specialist unit with a BMI of 13.5 kg/m2 and orthostatic hypotension. She exhibited lanugo hair and peripheral cyanosis. Treatment involved a multidisciplinary approach including slow nasogastric refeeding, electrolyte monitoring, and intensive psychotherapy, with a target weight gain of 0.5kg-1kg per week.

malnutrition_006:

  presenting_complaint: Difficulty swallowing and 10% weight loss over 4 weeks
  summary_of_course: A 76-year-old male developed severe oropharyngeal dysphagia following a right-sided ischaemic stroke. Speech and Language Therapy (SLT) assessment confirmed aspiration risk, leading to inadequate oral intake. He was initially managed with a nasogastric tube before transitioning to a Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG) for long-term nutritional support.

malnutrition_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Micronutrient malnutrition (Scurvy)
  presenting_complaint: Bleeding gums and perifollicular haemorrhages
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old male with a restrictive diet consisting solely of bread and processed meat presented with painful joints and easy bruising. Clinical suspicion of Vitamin C deficiency was confirmed by low serum ascorbic acid levels. Symptoms resolved rapidly within two weeks of high-dose oral Vitamin C supplementation and dietary counselling.

malnutrition_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic malnutrition in COPD
  presenting_complaint: Increased breathlessness and loss of muscle mass
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with GOLD stage IV COPD presented with an exacerbation and significant sarcopenia. His high work of breathing had led to a hypermetabolic state and unintentional weight loss. He was treated with nebulisers, steroids, and a high-calorie, protein-enriched diet, focusing on pulmonary rehabilitation to improve functional capacity.

malnutrition_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe acute malnutrition (Marasmus)
  presenting_complaint: Visible wasting and persistent diarrhoea
  summary_of_course: A 7-month-old infant presented with "old man" facies, prominent ribs, and absence of subcutaneous fat. The history revealed incorrect dilution of infant formula due to poverty. He was treated for dehydration and started on a WHO-standardised refeeding protocol, showing a slow but steady increase in weight-for-height Z-score.

malnutrition_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Malnutrition secondary to Short Bowel Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: High-output stoma and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female who underwent extensive small bowel resection for mesenteric ischaemia presented with TPN-dependence. She struggled with fluid and electrolyte balance, frequently presenting with pre-renal azotaemia. She is currently managed with home parenteral nutrition (HPN) and teduglutide to enhance intestinal adaptation.

malnutrition_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild malnutrition in early dementia
  presenting_complaint: Forgetfulness and "tea and toast" diet
  summary_of_course: An 81-year-old male with Alzheimer's disease was found to have a MUST score of 1 during a routine GP check-up. He lived alone and often forgot to prepare meals, leading to a BMI of 19.5 kg/m2. Management included referral to community dietetics, "meals on wheels" services, and fortified milkshakes, which stabilised his weight.

malnutrition_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic malnutrition in ICU
  presenting_complaint: Prolonged weaning from mechanical ventilation
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male in the ICU for 3 weeks following severe sepsis developed significant muscle wasting and a negative nitrogen balance. Initial under-delivery of enteral nutrition due to high gastric residual volumes exacerbated his catabolic state. Optimisation of prokinetics and increasing protein delivery to 1.5g/kg/day assisted in successful ventilator weaning.

malnutrition_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Malnutrition secondary to untreated Coeliac Disease
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal bloating and iron-deficiency anaemia
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female presented with chronic diarrhoea and a BMI of 17.8 kg/m2. Blood tests showed low ferritin, folate, and positive anti-TTG antibodies. Duodenal biopsy confirmed Marsh 3c changes; she was started on a strict gluten-free diet and micronutrient supplementation, resulting in symptom resolution and weight gain over 6 months.

malnutrition_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Cancer Cachexia
  presenting_complaint: Profound weight loss and anorexia
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma presented with a 20% weight loss over 3 months. He exhibited systemic inflammation with raised CRP and low albumin, characteristic of the refractory cachexia stage. Management focused on palliative nutritional support, including PERT and orexigenic agents to improve quality of life.

malnutrition_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-bariatric surgery malnutrition
  presenting_complaint: Paraesthesia and gait instability
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female, two years post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, presented with neurological symptoms. Investigations revealed severe Vitamin B12 and copper deficiencies despite reported adherence to standard supplements. She required parenteral B12 injections and oral copper supplementation, highlighting the need for lifelong monitoring after malabsorptive procedures.

malnutrition_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate malnutrition in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
  presenting_complaint: Poor appetite and metallic taste (uraemia)
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with Stage 5 CKD not on dialysis presented with protein-energy wasting (PEW). His intake was limited by uraemic symptoms and a restrictive renal diet. He was managed with renal-specific oral nutritional supplements and close monitoring of phosphate and potassium levels to balance nutrition with metabolic constraints.

malnutrition_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute malnutrition secondary to Hyperemesis Gravidarum
  presenting_complaint: Intractable vomiting and 8% weight loss in first trimester
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old pregnant female (G1P0) at 10 weeks gestation was admitted with severe dehydration and ketonuria. She was unable to tolerate any oral intake for 5 days. Management included IV fluid resuscitation, thiamine supplementation to prevent Wernicke's, and a combination of antiemetics, eventually requiring a short course of nasogastric feeding.

malnutrition_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Malnutrition due to social neglect
  presenting_complaint: Global developmental delay and stunting
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old boy was brought to A&E with multiple bruises and significant growth failure (height <3rd centile). Clinical assessment showed signs of chronic malnutrition with no underlying organic cause found on screening. He was placed in foster care where he received a structured high-calorie diet, resulting in rapid "catch-up" growth and improved social milestones.

malnutrition_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe malnutrition in Orofacial Malignancy
  presenting_complaint: Inability to chew and persistent mouth pain
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue presented with a BMI of 15.1 kg/m2. Tumour bulk and pain made oral intake impossible. A radiologically inserted gastrostomy (RIG) was placed prior to starting radiotherapy to ensure adequate nutrition and hydration during his oncological treatment.

malnutrition_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic malnutrition in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)
  presenting_complaint: Multiple fractures and low BMI
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male with long-standing, poorly controlled Crohn's disease presented with a fragility fracture of the wrist. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) showed osteoporosis, attributed to chronic malabsorption and long-term corticosteroid use. He was started on biologic therapy to control bowel inflammation and high-dose Vitamin D and calcium to address his nutritional bone disease.
