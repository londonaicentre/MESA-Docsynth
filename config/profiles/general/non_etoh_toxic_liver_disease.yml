non_etoh_toxic_liver_disease_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Co-amoxiclav induced cholestatic liver injury
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice and intense pruritus
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male developed dark urine and yellowing of the sclera three weeks after completing a course of co-amoxiclav for a chest infection. Investigations revealed an ALP of 850 U/L and bilirubin of 120 µmol/L with normal imaging of the biliary tree. The diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) was made, and symptoms resolved over two months with symptomatic management for itching.

non_etoh_toxic_liver_disease_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Methotrexate-induced hepatic fibrosis
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes on routine monitoring
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female with rheumatoid arthritis on long-term methotrexate (15mg weekly) showed a gradual rise in PIIINP levels and a FibroScan reading of 14.5 kPa. A liver biopsy confirmed Stage 3 fibrosis with minimal inflammation, attributed to cumulative methotrexate toxicity. She was switched to leflunomide, and her liver stiffness scores stabilised over the following year.

non_etoh_toxic_liver_disease_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Anabolic steroid-induced cholestasis
  presenting_complaint: Severe jaundice and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old male bodybuilder presented with a bilirubin of 450 µmol/L and profound malaise after using illicit oral stanozolol. Clinical examination noted no stigmata of chronic liver disease but marked icterus. He required hospitalisation for nutritional support and monitoring, with jaundice taking four months to fully resolve after cessation of the supplement.

non_etoh_toxic_liver_disease_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Amanita phalloides poisoning
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal cramps and profuse watery diarrhoea
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented 12 hours after consuming wild mushrooms foraged in a local forest. He developed fulminant hepatic failure with an INR of 6.5 and Grade 3 encephalopathy within 48 hours. Despite treatment with silibinin and NAC, he met King's College Criteria and underwent an emergency orthotopic liver transplant.

non_etoh_toxic_liver_disease_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Nitrofurantoin-induced chronic hepatitis
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue and joint pain
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female taking long-term nitrofurantoin prophylaxis for recurrent UTIs presented with features mimicking autoimmune hepatitis, including positive ANA and elevated IgG. Liver biopsy showed interface hepatitis and plasma cell infiltration. Withdrawal of the antibiotic and a short course of prednisolone led to complete biochemical remission.

non_etoh_toxic_liver_disease_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Isoniazid-induced hepatotoxicity
  presenting_complaint: Loss of appetite and mild epigastric discomfort
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male undergoing treatment for latent tuberculosis was found to have an ALT of 320 U/L (8x ULN) during routine monitoring. He was asymptomatic, but the isoniazid was suspended as per protocol. Enzymes returned to baseline within three weeks, allowing for a cautious reintroduction of an alternative TB regimen.

non_etoh_toxic_liver_disease_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Sodium valproate-induced acute liver failure
  presenting_complaint: Lethargy and altered consciousness
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old girl with refractory epilepsy recently started on sodium valproate presented with vomiting and rapid neurological decline. Bloods revealed hyperammonaemia and moderately raised transaminases, consistent with valproate-induced mitochondrial toxicity. Despite intensive care and L-carnitine therapy, she succumbed to cerebral oedema.

non_etoh_toxic_liver_disease_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Amiodarone-induced steatohepatitis
  presenting_complaint: Dyspnoea and mild hepatomegaly
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male on long-term amiodarone for atrial fibrillation was investigated for incidental findings of "bright liver" on ultrasound. Biopsy revealed phospholipidosis with foamy hepatocytes and Mallory-Denk bodies, resembling alcoholic steatohepatitis. Given his cardiac history, the amiodarone dose was reduced, and liver function was monitored closely.

non_etoh_toxic_liver_disease_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Nivolumab-induced immune-mediated hepatitis
  presenting_complaint: Fever and malaise
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female with metastatic melanoma developed Grade 3 hepatotoxicity (ALT 600 U/L) after her fourth cycle of nivolumab. Other causes of hepatitis were excluded, and she was treated with 1mg/kg of intravenous methylprednisolone. Her liver enzymes improved rapidly, but the immunotherapy was permanently discontinued.

non_etoh_toxic_liver_disease_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Flucloxacillin-induced vanishing bile duct syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Persistent jaundice and skin excoriations
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female developed cholestatic jaundice two weeks after finishing flucloxacillin for cellulitis. While most cases resolve, her jaundice persisted for six months, and a repeat biopsy showed significant ductopenia. She was managed with ursodeoxycholic acid and rifampicin for pruritus, showing very slow partial recovery.

non_etoh_toxic_liver_disease_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Green tea extract hepatotoxicity
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice and dark urine
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female presented with acute hepatitis (ALT 1200 U/L) after taking high-dose green tea extract supplements for weight loss. Viral and autoimmune screens were negative. Upon stopping the supplement, her liver enzymes normalised within six weeks, confirming a diagnosis of HDS-induced DILI.

non_etoh_toxic_liver_disease_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Phenytoin-induced DRESS syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Rash, fever, and facial swelling
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male started on phenytoin for seizures presented three weeks later with a diffuse maculopapular rash, lymphadenopathy, and eosinophilia. Liver function tests showed an ALT of 800 U/L and ALP of 400 U/L. He was diagnosed with Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and recovered following drug withdrawal and systemic corticosteroid treatment.

non_etoh_toxic_liver_disease_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Khat-induced chronic liver injury
  presenting_complaint: Vague abdominal discomfort and splenomegaly
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male from the Somali community presented with signs of portal hypertension. History revealed daily chewing of Khat (Catha edulis) for over 15 years and no other risk factors for liver disease. Investigations showed established cirrhosis, which was attributed to the chronic hepatotoxic effects of the cathinone alkaloids in Khat.

non_etoh_toxic_liver_disease_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Azathioprine-induced sinusoidal obstruction syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly increasing abdominal girth and painful hepatomegaly
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female with Crohn's disease on azathioprine for two years developed sudden onset ascites and RUQ pain. Imaging showed no hepatic vein thrombosis (excluding Budd-Chiari), but biopsy confirmed sinusoidal dilatation and congestion. Azathioprine was stopped, and she was managed with diuretics, leading to a gradual resolution of the portal hypertension.

non_etoh_toxic_liver_disease_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Carbon tetrachloride poisoning
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal pain, dizziness, and oliguria
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male working in an industrial cleaning facility was accidentally exposed to high concentrations of carbon tetrachloride vapours. He presented with acute toxic hepatitis and concomitant acute tubular necrosis. He required temporary haemodialysis and supportive care in the ICU, eventually making a full recovery of both hepatic and renal function.

non_etoh_toxic_liver_disease_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Atorvastatin-induced mild transaminitis
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic (found on routine screening)
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male started on atorvastatin 40mg for primary prevention of CVD was found to have an ALT of 110 U/L (3x ULN) at a six-week check. He was otherwise well with no jaundice or hepatomegaly. The dose was reduced to 20mg, and the ALT stabilised at 55 U/L, which was deemed clinically acceptable to continue therapy.

non_etoh_toxic_liver_disease_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Diclofenac-induced idiosyncratic hepatitis
  presenting_complaint: Nausea and tea-coloured urine
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old female used diclofenac for two weeks for osteoarthritis before developing acute hepatitis (ALT 950 U/L). There was no history of pre-existing liver disease. The drug was discontinued immediately, and her liver enzymes returned to normal within four weeks, illustrating a classic idiosyncratic metabolic DILI.

non_etoh_toxic_liver_disease_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) hepatotoxicity
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice and fatigue
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male used a complex blend of Chinese herbs for eczema for three months. He presented with a bilirubin of 180 µmol/L and biopsy showed centrilobular necrosis and eosinophilic infiltration. Despite stopping the herbs, his recovery was protracted, requiring six months for the jaundice to fully resolve.

non_etoh_toxic_liver_disease_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Pyrazinamide-induced severe hepatitis
  presenting_complaint: Vomiting, jaundice, and right-sided chest pain
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male on quadruple therapy for pulmonary TB developed severe jaundice (bilirubin 300 µmol/L) six weeks into treatment. Pyrazinamide was identified as the most likely culprit and was permanently stopped. His liver function took over twelve weeks to normalise, during which time his TB was managed with a modified, less hepatotoxic regimen.
