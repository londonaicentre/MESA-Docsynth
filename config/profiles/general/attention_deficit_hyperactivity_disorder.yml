  presenting_complaint: Physical aggression and refusal to follow adult instructions.
  summary_of_course: A 9-year-old boy was referred to CAMHS following multiple school exclusions for violent outbursts.

  primary_diagnosis: ADHD, Late-life Presentation
  presenting_complaint: Cognitive difficulties and inability to manage retirement routine.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male presented with concerns of early-onset dementia, but neuropsychological testing showed no progressive memory loss.

attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_008:
  primary_diagnosis: ADHD, Treatment-Induced Tic Disorder
  presenting_complaint: Development of motor tics following stimulant initiation.
  summary_of_course: An 11-year-old boy with ADHD showed excellent focus on Methylphenidate but developed frequent facial grimacing and shoulder shrugging. Due to the severity of the tics, stimulants were discontinued. He was successfully transitioned to Guanfacine, which managed both his ADHD symptoms and reduced the frequency of his tics.

attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_010:
  primary_diagnosis: ADHD with comorbid Binge Eating Disorder
  presenting_complaint: Uncontrolled eating and impulsive spending.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female with a high BMI presented with cyclical binge eating and financial debt from impulsive purchases. Assessment identified ADHD as the primary driver for her lack of impulse control.

attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_011:
  primary_diagnosis: ADHD, Perinatal Management
  presenting_complaint: Significant functional decline during the second trimester of pregnancy.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old woman with well-controlled ADHD stopped her medication upon finding she was pregnant, leading to a total collapse in her ability to manage daily life and increasing anxiety. Following a risk-benefit consultation with a perinatal psychiatrist, she was restarted on a reduced dose of Methylphenidate. This allowed her to maintain her mental health and occupational functioning throughout the remainder of the pregnancy.

attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_012:

  presenting_complaint: Increasing clerical errors and difficulty with surgical documentation.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old Consultant Surgeon presented privately, reporting that the increasing administrative burden of his role was becoming impossible to manage.

  presenting_complaint: Extreme daytime sleepiness and hyperactivity in the evenings.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy was referred for suspected ADHD and severe snoring. While his ADHD symptoms were clear, a sleep study also confirmed OSA. Tonsillectomy improved his sleep quality, but ADHD symptoms persisted, necessitating a dual approach of nocturnal CPAP and daytime Atomoxetine.

  primary_diagnosis: ADHD with comorbid Bipolar II Disorder
  presenting_complaint: Periods of excessive energy followed by severe depressive crashes.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old woman was being treated for Bipolar II, but her distractibility and restlessness persisted even during euthymic periods. After her mood was stabilised with Lamotrigine, ADHD was confirmed as a comorbidity.

  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old man presented to his GP with mild but persistent problems with forgetfulness and losing items.

  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old boy with ADHD experienced a sustained heart rate of 120 bpm after increasing his dose of Lisdexamfetamine. An ECG and cardiology review were performed. Stimulants were discontinued due to the cardiovascular side effects, and he was successfully managed on Guanfacine, which had the added benefit of slightly lowering his blood pressure.

  primary_diagnosis: ADHD and Developmental Coordination Disorder (Dyspraxia)
  presenting_complaint: Clumsiness, poor handwriting, and social withdrawal.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old girl presented with significant difficulties in physical education and slow handwriting, alongside typical ADHD symptoms of inattention.

  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy with severe hyperactivity remained highly disruptive despite trials of Methylphenidate, Lisdexamfetamine, and Atomoxetine at maximum doses. Genomic testing was unremarkable, but his environment was high-stress. A switch to a combination of Guanfacine and intensive family systemic therapy finally provided moderate symptom control and improved his quality of life.
