  primary_diagnosis: Chronic asymptomatic left bundle branch block
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding on routine ECG
  summary_of_course: 78-year-old male with long-standing hypertension presented for an annual review. ECG revealed a QRS duration of 160ms with a typical LBBB pattern, unchanged from three years prior. Echocardiogram showed mild concentric LVH with preserved ejection fraction (55%), and he remains managed conservatively in primary care.

left_bundle_branch_block_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute myocardial infarction with new-onset LBBB
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset retrosternal chest pain and diaphoresis
  summary_of_course: 62-year-old female presented to A&E with crushing chest pain; ECG showed a new LBBB meeting Sgarbossa criteria. She was transferred urgently for primary PCI, which revealed a proximal LAD occlusion. Following successful stenting, her LBBB persisted, and she was started on standard post-MI pharmacotherapy including ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers.

  presenting_complaint: Progressive dyspnoea on exertion and orthopnoea
  summary_of_course: 65-year-old male with non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy and an EF of 28% presented with worsening NYHA Class III symptoms. ECG confirmed LBBB with a QRS duration of 175ms, prompting referral for Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy (CRT-D). Post-procedure, his QRS narrowed to 130ms, and he reported significant improvement in exercise tolerance.

left_bundle_branch_block_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-procedural left bundle branch block
  presenting_complaint: New conduction delay following TAVI
  summary_of_course: 82-year-old female underwent a Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) for severe aortic stenosis. Post-procedure ECG demonstrated a new-onset LBBB which was not present pre-operatively. She was monitored for 48 hours for progression to high-grade AV block; as she remained haemodynamically stable, she was discharged with planned outpatient cardiology follow-up.

left_bundle_branch_block_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-surgical left bundle branch block
  presenting_complaint: Routine post-operative paediatric cardiac review
  summary_of_course: 8-year-old boy who previously underwent surgical VSD repair presented for a scheduled check-up. ECG showed a stable LBBB pattern, a known complication of his previous septal surgery. He remains asymptomatic with normal ventricular function on echocardiography and requires no active intervention.

left_bundle_branch_block_006:
  primary_diagnosis: LBBB secondary to severe calcific aortic stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Exertional syncope and chest tightness
  summary_of_course: 80-year-old male presented after a syncopal episode while walking. Investigations revealed severe calcific aortic stenosis (mean gradient 50mmHg) and a concomitant LBBB on ECG. He was referred for urgent surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) to address the mechanical obstruction and associated conduction system disease.

left_bundle_branch_block_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic LBBB in an athlete
  presenting_complaint: Abnormal ECG during sports screening
  summary_of_course: 35-year-old marathon runner was found to have LBBB during a mandatory club screening. Despite the abnormal ECG, he was entirely asymptomatic with a high functional capacity. Comprehensive workup including cardiac MRI and exercise stress testing showed no structural heart disease, leading to a diagnosis of isolated LBBB.

left_bundle_branch_block_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic heart failure with LBBB
  presenting_complaint: Severe peripheral oedema and weight gain
  summary_of_course: 70-year-old female with known chronic LBBB and ischaemic heart disease presented with decompensated heart failure. She was treated with intravenous furosemide and optimisaton of her heart failure medications. Her LBBB remained permanent, contributing to ventricular dyssynchrony that necessitated a review for CRT upgrading.

left_bundle_branch_block_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcohol-related cardiomyopathy with LBBB
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations and abdominal bloating
  summary_of_course: 55-year-old male with a history of heavy alcohol consumption presented with new-onset atrial fibrillation and LBBB. Echocardiography showed global hypokinesis and a dilated left ventricle (EF 30%). Following six months of abstinence and medical therapy, his EF improved slightly, but the LBBB persisted as a permanent feature.

left_bundle_branch_block_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute myocarditis presenting with LBBB
  presenting_complaint: Pleuritic chest pain following a viral prodrome
  summary_of_course: 24-year-old male presented with acute chest pain and a new LBBB on ECG. Troponin T was significantly elevated at 1200 ng/L, and cardiac MRI confirmed subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement consistent with myocarditis. The LBBB resolved spontaneously after three weeks as the myocardial inflammation subsided.

left_bundle_branch_block_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Pseudo-LBBB due to severe hyperkalaemia
  presenting_complaint: Generalised weakness and bradycardia
  summary_of_course: 54-year-old male with end-stage renal disease presented with a potassium level of 7.8 mmol/L. The ECG showed a "sine-wave" appearance mimicking a wide-complex LBBB. Following emergent treatment with calcium gluconate and insulin-dextrose, the QRS duration normalised, confirming the conduction delay was metabolic rather than structural.

left_bundle_branch_block_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Rate-dependent left bundle branch block
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent palpitations during exercise
  summary_of_course: 50-year-old male underwent a treadmill stress test for atypical symptoms. At a heart rate of 140 bpm, he developed a sudden LBBB pattern which disappeared during recovery when his heart rate dropped below 115 bpm. Coronary angiography was clear, and the phenomenon was attributed to a functional refractory period of the left bundle branch.

left_bundle_branch_block_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Cardiogenic shock with new LBBB
  presenting_complaint: Hypotension and altered mental status
  summary_of_course: 68-year-old male presented in cardiogenic shock with a BP of 80/50 mmHg. ECG showed a new LBBB and ST-segment elevation in the lateral leads. Despite emergency revascularisation and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support, he developed multi-organ failure and passed away in the ICU.

left_bundle_branch_block_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Cardiac amyloidosis with conduction disease
  presenting_complaint: Breathlessness and easy bruising
  summary_of_course: 74-year-old male presented with symptoms of restrictive cardiomyopathy. ECG showed low voltage complexes in the limb leads despite a co-existing LBBB. A fat pad biopsy and DPD scan confirmed ATTR amyloidosis, with the LBBB representing progressive infiltration of the cardiac conduction system.

left_bundle_branch_block_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Chagasic cardiomyopathy with LBBB
  presenting_complaint: Chronic fatigue and dizzy spells
  summary_of_course: 42-year-old male originally from South America presented with symptomatic bradycardia. ECG revealed LBBB and first-degree AV block. Serology was positive for Trypanosoma cruzi, and he was managed for Chagasic heart disease with a permanent pacemaker and benznidazole.

left_bundle_branch_block_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Incidental LBBB in a frail elderly patient
  presenting_complaint: Assessment following a mechanical fall
  summary_of_course: 92-year-old female was admitted following a fall at her care home. ECG showed a LBBB of unknown duration; however, she was asymptomatic from a cardiac perspective with no history of syncope. Given her frailty and lack of symptoms, a conservative approach was taken without further invasive cardiac investigations.

left_bundle_branch_block_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Peripartum cardiomyopathy with LBBB
  presenting_complaint: Severe SOB two weeks post-delivery
  summary_of_course: 32-year-old female presented with acute pulmonary oedema shortly after childbirth. ECG demonstrated a new LBBB and echocardiography showed an EF of 20%. She was started on bromocriptine and standard heart failure therapy, but her LBBB persisted, eventually requiring a CRT-D implant six months later.

left_bundle_branch_block_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Cardiac sarcoidosis with LBBB
  presenting_complaint: Syncope and dry cough
  summary_of_course: 48-year-old female with known pulmonary sarcoidosis presented with a blackout. ECG showed LBBB and episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Cardiac PET-CT showed active myocardial inflammation, and she was treated with high-dose steroids and an ICD for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death.

left_bundle_branch_block_019:
  primary_diagnosis: CRT-D non-responder with persistent LBBB
  presenting_complaint: Refractory heart failure symptoms
  summary_of_course: 66-year-old male with LBBB and HFrEF underwent CRT-D implantation one year ago. Despite optimal lead positioning and a narrowed QRS, he remained in NYHA Class IV. Further imaging revealed extensive posterolateral wall scarring, explaining the lack of symptomatic response to resynchronisation therapy.

left_bundle_branch_block_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Pre-operative new-onset LBBB
  presenting_complaint: Routine ECG prior to elective hip arthroplasty
  summary_of_course: 58-year-old female was found to have a new LBBB on her pre-assessment ECG. Surgery was postponed for a cardiology review, which included a stress echo that was negative for inducible ischaemia. She was cleared for surgery with a diagnosis of idiopathic LBBB and underwent her procedure without perioperative cardiac complications.
