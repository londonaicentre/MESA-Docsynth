  primary_diagnosis: Paraneoplastic sensory neuronopathy
  presenting_complaint: Progressive sensory ataxia and painful paraesthesia in all four limbs.
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male smoker presented with subacute onset of asymmetric numbness and severe gait instability. Investigations revealed positive anti-Hu antibodies and a previously undiagnosed small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) on CT thorax. Despite treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and chemotherapy for the primary tumour, the patient remained significantly disabled with permanent sensory loss.

polyneuropathy_in_neoplastic_disease_002:
  primary_diagnosis: POEMS syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Progressive lower limb weakness, skin hyperpigmentation, and peripheral oedema.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female presented with chronic distal motor weakness and organomegaly. Investigations confirmed a monoclonal plasma cell dyscrasia, elevated VEGF levels, and sclerotic bone lesions on skeletal survey. Treatment involved autologous stem cell transplantation, resulting in gradual improvement of the demyelinating polyneuropathy over 12 months.

polyneuropathy_in_neoplastic_disease_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Neurolymphomatosis
  presenting_complaint: Severe, lancinating pain in the right leg and progressive foot drop.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with a history of B-cell lymphoma presented with acute-on-chronic mononeuritis multiplex. MRI of the lumbosacral plexus showed nerve root thickening, and PET-CT confirmed direct lymphomatous infiltration of the peripheral nerves. Intensive systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy were initiated, leading to partial symptomatic relief.

polyneuropathy_in_neoplastic_disease_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute motor neuropathy associated with Hodgkin's lymphoma
  presenting_complaint: Symmetrical painless leg weakness and difficulty climbing stairs.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female presented with subacute lower motor neuron weakness and absent reflexes. CSF analysis showed mild protein elevation without pleocytosis, and lymph node biopsy confirmed Hodgkin's lymphoma. The neuropathy, characterized by anterior horn cell involvement, stabilised following successful treatment of the lymphoma with ABVD chemotherapy.

polyneuropathy_in_neoplastic_disease_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Paraneoplastic autonomic neuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Severe orthostatic hypotension, chronic constipation, and urinary retention.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male presented with life-threatening autonomic instability and weight loss. Screening for occult malignancy identified a small cell lung tumour; anti-ganglionic acetylcholine receptor antibodies were detected. Management required intensive ICU support for haemodynamic monitoring and targeted oncological therapy, but autonomic recovery was incomplete.

polyneuropathy_in_neoplastic_disease_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) secondary to Waldenström macroglobulinaemia
  presenting_complaint: Slowly progressive distal numbness and hand clumsiness.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male presented with a two-year history of sensory-motor deficits. Serum protein electrophoresis identified an IgM paraprotein, and nerve conduction studies showed classic demyelinating features. The patient responded poorly to corticosteroids but showed significant functional improvement following rituximab therapy for the underlying macroglobulinaemia.

polyneuropathy_in_neoplastic_disease_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Anti-CV2/CRMP5 associated paraneoplastic neuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Combined sensory-motor neuropathy and visual disturbances.
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old female presented with subacute limb weakness and optic neuritis. Serology was positive for anti-CV2 antibodies, and imaging located a thymoma. Following thymectomy and plasma exchange, the neurological progression halted, though the patient required long-term physiotherapy for residual motor deficits.

polyneuropathy_in_neoplastic_disease_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Cachectic polyneuropathy in advanced gastric adenocarcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Mild distal "pins and needles" and muscle wasting.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with metastatic gastric cancer and severe malnutrition developed a chronic, mild axonal sensory neuropathy. Investigations ruled out vitamin B12 deficiency and paraneoplastic antibodies, attributing the neuropathy to metabolic exhaustion and cachexia. Management was palliative, focusing on neuropathic pain control with gabapentin.

polyneuropathy_in_neoplastic_disease_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Paraneoplastic vasculitic neuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Acute, painful multifocal nerve palsies and purpuric rash.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old female with underlying renal cell carcinoma presented with acute mononeuritis multiplex. Sural nerve biopsy confirmed a non-systemic necrotising vasculitis associated with her malignancy. High-dose methylprednisolone and nephrectomy were performed, resulting in a slow recovery of nerve function over several months.

polyneuropathy_in_neoplastic_disease_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric paraneoplastic neuropathy in neuroblastoma
  presenting_complaint: Irritability, opsoclonus, and refusal to walk.
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old boy presented with opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome and an associated mild peripheral neuropathy. Abdominal ultrasound identified a localized neuroblastoma. Following surgical resection and IVIG, the neurological symptoms, including the neuropathic gait changes, resolved rapidly.

polyneuropathy_in_neoplastic_disease_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Sensory neuropathy associated with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic numbness in the toes and balls of the feet.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes, presented with worsening distal sensory loss. While initially attributed to diabetes, the presence of an IgG kappa paraprotein and disproportionate electrophysiological findings suggested a malignancy-associated component. Monitoring was established to watch for progression to multiple myeloma.

polyneuropathy_in_neoplastic_disease_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute axonal paraneoplastic polyneuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive ascending paralysis over 48 hours.
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old female presented with symptoms mimicking Guillain-Barré syndrome but with atypical features on EMG. Extensive screening revealed an underlying ovarian carcinoma. Despite aggressive treatment with plasmapheresis and tumour debulking, the patient developed respiratory failure and required prolonged mechanical ventilation.

polyneuropathy_in_neoplastic_disease_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Paraneoplastic sensory ataxia (Anti-Ri associated)
  presenting_complaint: Profound loss of balance and "electric shock" sensations in the limbs.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female presented with subacute sensory ataxia and vertigo. Anti-Ri (ANNA-2) antibodies were detected, and breast screening identified a small ductal carcinoma in situ. The neuropathy stabilized after mastectomy and chemotherapy, but the patient required a wheelchair for mobility due to permanent proprioceptive loss.

polyneuropathy_in_neoplastic_disease_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Multiple myeloma-associated Amyloid Light-chain (AL) amyloidosis neuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Painful small-fibre neuropathy and carpal tunnel syndrome.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male presented with severe burning pain in the feet and autonomic dysfunction. Fat pad biopsy confirmed AL amyloidosis, and bone marrow biopsy showed 20% plasma cells. Treatment with bortezomib and dexamethasone targeted the underlying myeloma, but the painful neuropathy remained a significant challenge for palliative management.

polyneuropathy_in_neoplastic_disease_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute sensory-motor polyneuropathy in occult SCLC
  presenting_complaint: Progressive weakness and numbness preceding respiratory symptoms.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male presented to the outpatient clinic with a 3-month history of distal limb weakness. Initial neurological workup was inconclusive until a routine chest X-ray showed a hilar mass, later confirmed as SCLC. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge where neuropathy precedes the primary cancer diagnosis by several months.

polypolyneuropathy_in_neoplastic_disease_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic sensorimotor neuropathy in CLL
  presenting_complaint: Mild, persistent tingling in the fingers and toes.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male with stable Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) developed a slowly progressive axonal polyneuropathy. Extensive investigations ruled out other causes, and the condition was managed expectantly as a low-grade paraneoplastic phenomenon. The severity remained mild, not requiring specific immunomodulatory therapy.

polyneuropathy_in_neoplastic_disease_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Paraneoplastic phrenic neuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Unexplained dyspnoea and orthopnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male presented with respiratory distress and bilateral diaphragmatic palsy. Electromyography confirmed phrenic nerve involvement as part of a wider paraneoplastic polyradiculopathy. A PET scan identified an occult bronchial carcinoid tumour; resection led to gradual improvement in respiratory function over six months.

polyneuropathy_in_neoplastic_disease_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Brachial plexus infiltration (Neurolymphomatosis)
  presenting_complaint: Severe left shoulder pain and wasting of the intrinsic hand muscles.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female with a history of treated Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma presented with a suspected relapse. MRI showed enhancement of the left brachial plexus, and CSF cytology confirmed lymphomatous meningitis with peripheral nerve root involvement. Despite salvage chemotherapy, the patient experienced progressive neurological decline.

polyneuropathy_in_neoplastic_disease_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Treatment-refractory paraneoplastic sensory neuronopathy
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive loss of all sensory modalities.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with SCLC and anti-Hu antibodies failed to respond to IVIG, steroids, and cyclophosphamide. The neuropathy progressed to involve the cranial nerves, leading to dysphagia and aspiration pneumonia. This case represents a severe, life-threatening presentation where the autoimmune process is independent of primary tumour control.

polyneuropathy_in_neoplastic_disease_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Relapsing-remitting paraneoplastic CIDP
  presenting_complaint: Episodic limb weakness and sensory loss.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male presented with recurrent bouts of demyelinating neuropathy over three years. Eventually, a low-grade follicular lymphoma was discovered during a period of relapse. Treatment of the lymphoma resulted in a sustained neurological remission, demonstrating the close temporal relationship between the neoplasm and the immune-mediated nerve damage.
