extrapulmonary_tuberculosis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Tuberculous Cervical Lymphadenitis
  presenting_complaint: Painless, enlarging swelling in the right side of the neck.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old female presented with a persistent 3cm supraclavicular mass and drenching night sweats. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) demonstrated granulomatous inflammation with caseous necrosis, and M. tuberculosis was confirmed via liquid culture. She completed a six-month course of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (RIPE) with full resolution of the lymphadenopathy.

extrapulmonary_tuberculosis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Tuberculous Meningitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe headache, projectile vomiting, and progressive confusion.
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old male was admitted to the paediatric ICU with meningism and a reduced Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 10. Lumbar puncture revealed high protein, low glucose, and lymphocytic pleocytosis; CT imaging showed basal meningeal enhancement and early hydrocephalus. He was treated with anti-tuberculosis therapy and high-dose dexamethasone, resulting in survival but with residual mild cognitive impairment.

extrapulmonary_tuberculosis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Spinal Tuberculosis (Pott's Disease)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic lower back pain and progressive kyphotic deformity.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with a history of weight loss presented with thoracic spine tenderness and lower limb weakness. MRI revealed destruction of the T11-T12 vertebral bodies and a large paravertebral "cold" abscess. Following CT-guided drainage and a 12-month course of anti-TB medication, his neurological symptoms improved, though he required spinal stabilisation surgery.

extrapulmonary_tuberculosis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Genitourinary Tuberculosis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent dysuria and frequency with sterile pyuria.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male was investigated for recurrent urinary tract symptoms despite multiple courses of standard antibiotics. Urinalysis showed persistent leucocytes but no growth on routine media; however, three early-morning urine samples were positive for M. tuberculosis on PCR. Treatment was initiated to prevent further renal scarring and ureteric strictures.

extrapulmonary_tuberculosis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Tuberculous Peritonitis
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal distension, vague pain, and significant weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female presented with a "doughy" abdomen and shifting dullness on percussion. Ascitic fluid analysis showed an exudative pattern with a high adenosine deaminase (ADA) level of 45 U/L. Laparoscopy revealed multiple "millet-seed" nodules across the peritoneum, and biopsy confirmed caseating granulomas, leading to a successful six-month treatment course.

extrapulmonary_tuberculosis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Tuberculous Pericarditis
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath, chest heaviness, and muffled heart sounds.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old HIV-positive male presented in acute respiratory distress with signs of cardiac tamponade. Echocardiography showed a large pericardial effusion with fibrinous strands, and pericardiocentesis confirmed TB via GeneXpert. He required a pericardial window and prolonged anti-TB therapy alongside antiretroviral management.

extrapulmonary_tuberculosis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Lupus Vulgaris (Cutaneous TB)
  presenting_complaint: Slowly enlarging, reddish-brown plaque on the cheek.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female had a chronic, asymptomatic facial lesion for over two years that had been misdiagnosed as discoid lupus. Diascopy revealed "apple-jelly" nodules, and a skin biopsy showed typical tuberculoid granulomas. The lesion regressed significantly after four months of quadruple anti-TB therapy.

extrapulmonary_tuberculosis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Ocular Tuberculosis (Posterior Uveitis)
  presenting_complaint: Blurred vision and floaters in the left eye.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male presented to ophthalmology with unilateral granulomatous uveitis and retinal vasculitis. While the chest X-ray was clear, an Interferon-Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) was strongly positive, and other causes of uveitis were excluded. He responded well to a combination of anti-TB medication and systemic corticosteroids, preventing permanent visual loss.

extrapulmonary_tuberculosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Tuberculous Pleurisy
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of right-sided pleuritic chest pain and dry cough.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old university student presented with a unilateral pleural effusion on chest radiography. Thoracocentesis showed a straw-coloured exudate with 90% lymphocytes and an ADA of 60 U/L. Pleural biopsy confirmed M. tuberculosis, and the patient achieved full recovery after standard 6-month chemotherapy.

extrapulmonary_tuberculosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Miliary Tuberculosis
  presenting_complaint: High fever, rapid weight loss, and multi-organ dysfunction.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old frail female was admitted with pyrexia of unknown origin and pancytopenia. Chest X-ray demonstrated a classic "millet-seed" pattern of fine nodules bilaterally, and sputum induction was eventually positive for AFB. Despite intensive care support and starting anti-TB treatment, she succumbed to respiratory failure within 48 hours.

extrapulmonary_tuberculosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Tuberculous Arthritis of the Knee
  presenting_complaint: Chronic, progressive swelling and pain in the right knee.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented with a "cold" joint swelling and significant muscle wasting of the quadriceps. Synovial fluid culture was negative for pyogenic bacteria, but synovial biopsy showed caseating granulomas and grew M. tuberculosis. He required surgical debridement followed by 12 months of anti-TB therapy to preserve joint function.

extrapulmonary_tuberculosis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Adrenal Tuberculosis (Addison's Disease)
  presenting_complaint: Profound fatigue, hyperpigmentation, and postural dizziness.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female presented with hypotension and hyponatraemia; physical exam noted darkening of the palmar creases. CT imaging revealed bilaterally enlarged, calcified adrenal glands, and a positive IGRA confirmed TB as the underlying cause. She required lifelong steroid replacement therapy in addition to a standard anti-TB regimen.

extrapulmonary_tuberculosis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Tuberculous Mastitis
  presenting_complaint: Firm, irregular lump in the left breast with skin tethering.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old lactating female was referred to the breast clinic with a suspected carcinoma. Triple assessment (mammography, ultrasound, and core biopsy) instead revealed necrotising granulomatous mastitis, and M. tuberculosis was detected on PCR. She was successfully treated with medical therapy, avoiding unnecessary radical surgery.

extrapulmonary_tuberculosis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Laryngeal Tuberculosis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent hoarseness and painful swallowing (odynophagia).
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male smoker presented with a six-week history of dysphonia and weight loss. Laryngoscopy showed ulceration of the vocal cords, initially suspicious for malignancy, but biopsy confirmed TB. Although primarily extrapulmonary, he was found to have concomitant cavitary pulmonary TB and was isolated due to high infectivity.

extrapulmonary_tuberculosis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Tuberculous Otitis Media
  presenting_complaint: Chronic, painless ear discharge and progressive hearing loss.
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old child had persistent otorrhoea that failed to respond to multiple courses of topical and systemic antibiotics. Examination revealed multiple tympanic membrane perforations and pale granulations in the middle ear. Culture of the ear discharge eventually grew M. tuberculosis, and the child was treated with paediatric anti-TB doses.

extrapulmonary_tuberculosis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Ileocaecal Tuberculosis
  presenting_complaint: Right iliac fossa pain, bloating, and altered bowel habit.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male was investigated for suspected Crohn's disease after presenting with a palpable mass in the right lower quadrant. Colonoscopy showed a patulous ileocaecal valve and ulceration; however, histology revealed caseating granulomas rather than the non-caseating type typical of Crohn's. Anti-TB treatment led to complete symptomatic relief and disappearance of the abdominal mass.

extrapulmonary_tuberculosis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Central Nervous System Tuberculoma
  presenting_complaint: New-onset tonic-clonic seizures and focal weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female with no prior medical history presented following a first-time seizure. MRI of the brain showed a 2cm ring-enhancing lesion with significant perilesional oedema in the frontal lobe. Stereotactic biopsy confirmed a tuberculoma, and she was treated with a 12-month course of anti-TB drugs and a tapering course of prednisolone.

extrapulmonary_tuberculosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Tuberculous Osteomyelitis of the Rib
  presenting_complaint: A fluctuant, non-tender mass on the anterior chest wall.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male presented with a "cold abscess" over the fourth rib that had been slowly growing for four months. Aspiration yielded thick, creamy pus that was smear-positive for AFB, and X-rays showed underlying rib erosion. He responded well to surgical drainage and a standard six-month chemotherapy regimen.

extrapulmonary_tuberculosis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Female Genital Tuberculosis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic pelvic pain and primary infertility.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female underwent investigation for infertility; hysterosalpingography showed bilateral tubal occlusion and a "beaded" appearance of the fallopian tubes. Endometrial curettage was performed, and the tissue was positive for M. tuberculosis on culture. Despite successful eradication of the infection with AKT, she required IVF for conception due to permanent tubal damage.

extrapulmonary_tuberculosis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Multi-drug Resistant (MDR) TB Lymphadenitis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent neck swelling and a persistent discharging sinus.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male who had previously been treated for TB in his home country presented with a breakdown of a cervical lymph node. Culture and sensitivity testing revealed resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid. He was started on an intensive second-line regimen including bedaquiline and levofloxacin, requiring close monitoring for 18 months.
