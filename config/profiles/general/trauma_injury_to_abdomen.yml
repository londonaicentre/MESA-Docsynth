  primary_diagnosis: Blast Injury to Abdomen
  presenting_complaint: Multiple shrapnel wounds and diffuse abdominal pain following an industrial explosion.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male presented with primary, secondary, and tertiary blast injuries. CT demonstrated multiple small bowel perforations and a Grade II renal laceration. He required multi-stage damage control surgery, including temporary abdominal closure, and spent three weeks in the ICU.

trauma_injury_to_abdomen_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Left Renal Contusion and Haematuria
  presenting_complaint: Gross haematuria after falling from a height of 10 feet.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old female fell from a tree, landing on her left side. Urinalysis showed macroscopic blood, and CT confirmed a Grade II renal contusion with no urinary extravasation. She was managed with strict bed rest and intravenous fluids until the haematuria cleared, with no long-term renal impairment.

trauma_injury_to_abdomen_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Occult Hollow Viscus Injury
  presenting_complaint: Persistent low-grade abdominal pain despite normal initial trauma scans.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female was involved in a low-speed RTA. Initial CT abdomen with contrast was reported as normal, but she returned 24 hours later with a rising CRP and localized tenderness. A repeat CT with oral contrast identified a small jejunal perforation, which was subsequently repaired laparoscopically.

trauma_injury_to_abdomen_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Retroperitoneal Haematoma secondary to Pelvic Fracture
  presenting_complaint: Pelvic instability and profound hypotension following a pedestrian-vs-car incident.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male sustained an "open book" pelvic fracture. CT showed a massive Zone 3 retroperitoneal haematoma causing haemodynamic collapse. He underwent urgent pelvic binder application and arterial embolisation by interventional radiology to control the venous and arterial bleeding.

trauma_injury_to_abdomen_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Failed Splenic Artery Embolisation
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent syncope and abdominal pain three days after a Grade III splenic injury.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male initially underwent successful proximal splenic artery embolisation for a sports injury. However, he developed a sudden drop in haemoglobin (115 to 62 g/L) on day three. Emergency laparotomy revealed a ruptured subcapsular haematoma, necessitating a salvage splenectomy.

trauma_injury_to_abdomen_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Abdominal Compartment Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Tense, distended abdomen and oliguria in a multi-trauma patient.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male received 15 units of blood products for a complex liver injury. On the ICU, his bladder pressure rose to 28 mmHg, accompanied by rising airway pressures and falling urine output. He underwent an emergency bedside decompressive laparotomy to relieve the intra-abdominal hypertension.

trauma_injury_to_abdomen_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Traumatic Diaphragmatic Hernia
  presenting_complaint: Respiratory distress and "hollow" abdomen following a crush injury.
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old male was pinned under a heavy gate. Chest X-ray revealed bowel loops in the left hemithorax and a shifted mediastinum. He underwent urgent thoracotomy and laparotomy, which confirmed a large radial tear in the left diaphragm; the stomach and spleen were reduced, and the defect was repaired with non-absorbable sutures.

  primary_diagnosis: Post-Traumatic Biloma
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice and dull RUQ pain two weeks after a liver laceration.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male was treated conservatively for a Grade III liver injury. He presented later with a bilirubin of 55 µmol/L and a localized fluid collection on ultrasound. A CT-guided drain was placed, yielding 500ml of bile-stained fluid, and an ERCP was performed to place a biliary stent for a persistent ductal leak.

  presenting_complaint: Acute left-sided abdominal pain after a minor cough.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with known chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and splenomegaly presented in shock. Despite the minimal "trauma" of coughing, CT showed a ruptured spleen with significant haemoperitoneum. Due to the underlying malignancy and ongoing haemorrhage, he underwent an emergency splenectomy.

trauma_injury_to_abdomen_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Traumatic Rupture of Abdominal Aortic Artery (AAA)
  presenting_complaint: Collapse and severe back pain following a fall downstairs.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with a known 4.5cm AAA fell and struck his abdomen. He arrived in A&E with a thready pulse and a pulsatile mass; CT confirmed the aneurysm had ruptured due to the blunt impact. He was taken immediately for an emergency endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).

  primary_diagnosis: Traumatic Abdominal Wall Hernia
  presenting_complaint: A painful lump in the flank that appeared after being kicked by a horse.
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old female presented with a 5cm bulge in the left lumbar region. CT imaging showed a disruption of the internal and external oblique muscles with herniation of mesenteric fat, but no bowel incarceration. She underwent an elective mesh repair of the traumatic defect three months later.
