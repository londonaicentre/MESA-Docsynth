endometriosis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Adolescent endometriosis
  presenting_complaint: Severe dysmenorrhoea and school absenteeism
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old female presented to her GP with debilitating cyclical pelvic pain unresponsive to ibuprofen. Pelvic ultrasound was unremarkable, but persistent symptoms led to a diagnostic laparoscopy revealing Stage I peritoneal endometriosis. She was started on a combined oral contraceptive pill and referred to a specialist adolescent gynaecology clinic for long-term management.

endometriosis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic pelvic pain and dyschezia
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old woman with a 5-year history of worsening pelvic pain reported painful defaecation during menstruation. MRI pelvis demonstrated a 2cm nodule infiltrating the muscularis propria of the anterior rectum and involving the torus uterinus. She underwent a multidisciplinary laparoscopic resection involving a colorectal surgeon, resulting in significant symptomatic relief.

endometriosis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Endometriosis-associated infertility
  presenting_complaint: Inability to conceive for 18 months
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old patient with regular cycles and mild dysmenorrhoea presented for fertility investigations. Hysterosalpingogram showed bilateral tubal patency, but laparoscopy identified extensive pelvic adhesions and Stage III endometriosis distorting tubo-ovarian anatomy. Following laparoscopic ablation and adhesiolysis, she successfully conceived via IVF six months later.

endometriosis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Ruptured ovarian endometrioma
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of severe lower abdominal pain and guarding
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department with signs of an acute abdomen and hypotension. Emergency laparoscopy revealed a ruptured 8cm left ovarian endometrioma with chocolate-coloured fluid throughout the peritoneal cavity. The cyst was excised, the cavity washed out, and she was discharged on day 3 with follow-up in the endometriosis clinic.

endometriosis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Thoracic endometriosis syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent right-sided chest pain and dyspnoea during menses
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old woman experienced three episodes of spontaneous right-sided pneumothorax, each coinciding with the first day of her period. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) identified diaphragmatic endometrial implants and small fenestrations. She was treated with pleurodesis and GnRH analogues to suppress oestrogen production and prevent recurrence.

endometriosis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-menopausal endometriosis
  presenting_complaint: New onset pelvic pain ten years after menopause
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old woman on high-dose oestrogen-only HRT presented with pelvic discomfort and a palpable adnexal mass. CA-125 was mildly elevated at 45 U/mL, and imaging suggested a complex cystic lesion. Histopathology following bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy confirmed a 4cm endometrioma with no evidence of malignancy, likely stimulated by exogenous oestrogen.

endometriosis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Diaphragmatic endometriosis
  presenting_complaint: Cyclical right shoulder tip pain
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old woman reported sharp, stabbing pain in her right shoulder that occurred exclusively during her menstrual cycle. MRI of the upper abdomen revealed multiple small nodules on the superior surface of the right diaphragm. She was managed conservatively with a levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), which reduced the frequency and intensity of the referred pain.

endometriosis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Urinary tract endometriosis
  presenting_complaint: Cyclical haematuria and frequency
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old woman presented with recurrent episodes of blood in her urine that synchronised with her periods. Cystoscopy during menstruation identified a bluish submucosal lesion in the bladder trigone, confirmed as endometriosis on biopsy. She underwent a partial cystectomy to remove the lesion, resolving her urinary symptoms and preventing potential ureteric obstruction.

endometriosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Umbilical endometriosis (Villar's nodule)
  presenting_complaint: Bleeding and swelling of the umbilicus during menses
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old woman with no previous abdominal surgery noted a small, firm nodule in her umbilicus that became painful and bled monthly. Clinical examination and ultrasound suggested a cutaneous endometriotic deposit. The nodule was surgically excised with clear margins, and histopathology confirmed the presence of endometrial glands and stroma.

endometriosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Sciatic nerve endometriosis
  presenting_complaint: Cyclical sciatica and right leg weakness
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old woman presented with right-sided sciatic pain that worsened significantly just before and during her period, leading to a temporary foot drop. Neurological imaging and pelvic MRI identified an endometriotic lesion infiltrating the sciatic notch. She required complex neuro-pelveoperineology surgery to decompress the nerve, followed by intensive physiotherapy.

endometriosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Stage IV endometriosis (Frozen Pelvis)
  presenting_complaint: Intractable pelvic pain and dyspareunia
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old woman with multiple previous surgeries presented with constant pelvic pain that was non-responsive to opioids. Laparoscopy revealed a 'frozen pelvis' with complete obliteration of the Pouch of Douglas and the rectum densely adherent to the posterior uterus. Due to the severity and failed medical management, she elected for a total laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with extensive adhesiolysis.

endometriosis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Endometriosis with comorbid Fibromyalgia
  presenting_complaint: Widespread musculoskeletal pain and cyclical pelvic flares
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old woman with a known diagnosis of fibromyalgia presented with worsening dysmenorrhoea and pelvic heaviness. Investigations confirmed peritoneal endometriosis, but her pain profile was complicated by central sensitisation. She was managed through a multidisciplinary chronic pain team, combining hormonal suppression with amitriptyline and cognitive behavioural therapy.

endometriosis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Endometriosis in a transgender man
  presenting_complaint: Breakthrough pelvic pain despite testosterone therapy
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old transgender man on long-term testosterone presented with recurring episodes of sharp pelvic pain. Despite amenorrhoea, pelvic ultrasound showed a persistent 3cm ovarian cyst with ground-glass echogenicity. Laparoscopic excision confirmed endometriosis, highlighting that testosterone suppression does not always resolve pre-existing endometriotic lesions.

endometriosis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Incisional (Scar) endometriosis
  presenting_complaint: Painful lump in a Caesarean section scar
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old woman, two years post-emergency C-section, noticed a palpable, tender mass at the lateral edge of her surgical scar. The mass increased in size and pain intensity during her menstrual periods. Wide local excision of the scar tissue was performed, and histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of scar endometriosis.

endometriosis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Appendiceal endometriosis
  presenting_complaint: Symptoms mimicking acute appendicitis
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old woman presented with acute right iliac fossa pain, nausea, and low-grade fever. At emergency laparotomy for suspected appendicitis, the appendix appeared inflamed and distorted by a firm nodule at the tip. Histological examination of the removed appendix revealed endometriosis of the serosa and muscularis propria rather than primary appendicitis.

endometriosis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Rectovaginal endometriosis
  presenting_complaint: Severe dyspareunia and vaginal bleeding
  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old woman reported deep dyspareunia so severe it prevented intercourse, accompanied by cyclical spotting from the posterior vaginal fornix. Speculum examination revealed a visible bluish nodule in the posterior fornix. Biopsy confirmed rectovaginal endometriosis, and she was treated with a combination of GnRH analogues and subsequent surgical excision.

endometriosis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic endometriosis
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding during laparoscopic sterilisation
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old woman with no history of pelvic pain or menstrual irregularities underwent elective laparoscopic tubal occlusion. During the procedure, several 'powder-burn' lesions were noted on the broad ligament and uterosacral ligaments. As the patient was asymptomatic, no further surgical intervention was performed, and she was counselled on the diagnosis for future reference.

endometriosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Infected endometrioma
  presenting_complaint: Pelvic pain, high fever, and vaginal discharge
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old woman with known ovarian endometriosis presented with subacute pelvic pain that suddenly worsened, accompanied by rigors and a CRP of 150 mg/L. Imaging showed a 6cm complex mass, and aspiration confirmed an infected endometrioma (tubo-ovarian abscess). She required intravenous antibiotics and laparoscopic drainage to resolve the sepsis.

endometriosis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Endometriosis-associated clear cell carcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly enlarging pelvic mass and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old woman with a long-standing history of endometriosis presented with increasing abdominal girth and early satiety. Imaging revealed a 15cm solid-cystic adnexal mass and ascites. Post-operative pathology following cytoreductive surgery confirmed clear cell carcinoma arising from a background of ovarian endometriosis.

endometriosis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Endometriosis secondary to OHVIRA syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Primary amenorrhoea and cyclical pelvic pain
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old girl presented with monthly pelvic pain but no menstrual flow. Investigations revealed Obstructed Hemivagina and Ipsilateral Renal Agenesis (OHVIRA) syndrome, with significant retrograde menstruation. Laparoscopy confirmed extensive Stage II endometriosis caused by the outflow obstruction, which regressed significantly after surgical correction of the vaginal septum.
