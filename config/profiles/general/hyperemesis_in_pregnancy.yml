  primary_diagnosis: Hyperemesis Gravidarum with Associated Liver Dysfunction
  presenting_complaint: Yellowing of the sclera and severe vomiting.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old at 11 weeks gestation presented with HG and mild jaundice. LFTs showed elevated transaminases (ALT 180 U/L) and bilirubin (35 μmol/L) with normal bile acids, ruling out obstetric cholestasis. The hepatic derangement resolved completely once hydration was restored and vomiting was controlled, confirming HG-associated hepatitis.

hyperemesis_in_pregnancy_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent Hyperemesis Gravidarum (Pre-emptive Management)
  presenting_complaint: Early onset nausea at 5 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old G5P4 with a history of severe HG in all previous pregnancies presented for early review. A pre-emptive plan was initiated including early start of Xonvea and rapid access to the Day Assessment Unit. This proactive approach prevented hospital admission and maintained her weight throughout the first trimester.

  primary_diagnosis: Hyperemesis Gravidarum with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)
  presenting_complaint: Unilateral leg swelling and pain following hospitalisation for HG.
  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old at 12 weeks gestation was admitted for severe HG and dehydration. Despite being on prophylactic LMWH, she developed a popliteal DVT, likely exacerbated by immobility and haemoconcentration. Treatment was escalated to therapeutic anticoagulation, and she was transitioned to outpatient HG management.

hyperemesis_in_pregnancy_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Hyperemesis Gravidarum with Severe Depression
  presenting_complaint: Suicidal ideation and request for termination due to physical suffering.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old at 10 weeks gestation with moderate HG expressed inability to cope with the persistent symptoms, leading to secondary depression. A multidisciplinary team including the perinatal mental health team and obstetricians provided intensive support. With the introduction of mirtazapine (for both mood and its antiemetic properties), her symptoms improved, and she continued the pregnancy.
