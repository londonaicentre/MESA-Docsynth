obstructive_hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (oHCM)
  presenting_complaint: Exertional dyspnoea and chest tightness.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented with progressive shortness of breath on exertion (NYHA Class II). Echocardiography revealed asymmetric septal hypertrophy (22mm) and systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve with a resting LVOT gradient of 45 mmHg. He was commenced on Bisoprolol 5mg OD, resulting in significant symptomatic improvement and reduction of the gradient to 18 mmHg.

obstructive_hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent exertional syncope.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female athlete collapsed during university hockey practice. Investigations showed a massive septal thickness of 32mm and a dynamic LVOT gradient of 110 mmHg on Valsalva. Due to high-risk features for sudden cardiac death (SCD), including non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) on Holter monitoring, she underwent dual-chamber ICD implantation and was started on Verapamil.

obstructive_hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy_003:
  primary_diagnosis: oHCM with New-Onset Atrial Fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations and acute-on-chronic breathlessness.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with known oHCM presented to A&E with rapid palpitations and pulmonary oedema. ECG confirmed atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 145 bpm, which exacerbated his LVOT obstruction due to loss of atrial kick and shortened diastolic filling. He was stabilised with intravenous Metoprolol, anticoagulated with Apixaban, and underwent successful electrical cardioversion.

obstructive_hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Persistent NYHA Class III symptoms despite maximal medical therapy.
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old woman remained severely symptomatic despite optimal doses of Bisoprolol and Disopyramide. Repeat echo showed a persistent resting gradient of 85 mmHg and severe mitral regurgitation secondary to SAM. She was referred for surgical septal myectomy (Morrow procedure), which successfully reduced the gradient to 10 mmHg and resolved her symptoms.

obstructive_hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy_005:
  primary_diagnosis: oHCM in an Elderly Patient
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue and light-headedness on standing.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male, previously misdiagnosed with aortic stenosis, was found to have a sigmoid septum and late-peaking systolic murmur. Cardiac MRI confirmed oHCM with a 19mm septum and significant SAM-mediated obstruction. Management was complicated by co-existing hypertension and renal impairment, necessitating cautious titration of Diltiazem.

obstructive_hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Provocable Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Occasional dizziness during heavy lifting.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male had a normal resting echocardiogram but a strong family history of HCM. Exercise stress echocardiography was performed, which induced a significant LVOT gradient of 60 mmHg only at peak exercise. He was diagnosed with latent/provocable oHCM and advised on lifestyle modifications and started on a low-dose beta-blocker.

obstructive_hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy_007:
  primary_diagnosis: oHCM with Alcohol Septal Ablation Complication
  presenting_complaint: Post-procedural bradycardia and syncope.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male underwent alcohol septal ablation for symptomatic oHCM. The procedure successfully reduced the LVOT gradient, but he developed a complete heart block 24 hours post-procedure. A permanent dual-chamber pacemaker was implanted, and he was discharged with significantly improved exercise tolerance.

obstructive_hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Poor feeding and failure to thrive.
  summary_of_course: A 6-month-old infant with Noonan syndrome was diagnosed with severe biventricular obstructive HCM. Echo showed massive septal hypertrophy obstructing both the LVOT and RVOT. He was managed by paediatric cardiology with high-dose Propranolol, though he remains under close surveillance for potential surgical intervention.

obstructive_hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy_009:
  primary_diagnosis: oHCM with Mavacamten Therapy
  presenting_complaint: Chronic exertional dyspnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with symptomatic oHCM (gradient 70 mmHg) was enrolled in a clinical programme for Mavacamten (cardiac myosin inhibitor). Over six months, her LVOT gradient reduced to 15 mmHg and her NT-proBNP levels normalised. She reported a significant improvement in her quality of life, moving from NYHA Class III to Class I.

obstructive_hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy_010:
  primary_diagnosis: oHCM presenting as Acute Coronary Syndrome Mimic
  presenting_complaint: Severe retrosternal chest pain and T-wave inversion.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male presented with acute chest pain and deep T-wave inversions across precordial leads. Coronary angiography showed clean arteries, but left ventriculography demonstrated a "spade-shaped" ventricle and significant outflow obstruction. Diagnosis of apical-variant HCM with mid-ventricular obstruction was confirmed via Cardiac MRI.

obstructive_hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy_011:
  primary_diagnosis: oHCM in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Worsening breathlessness in the second trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old woman with known oHCM became increasingly symptomatic at 24 weeks gestation. The physiological increase in blood volume and heart rate exacerbated her LVOT gradient. She was managed in a high-risk obstetric-cardiology clinic, her Metoprolol dose was adjusted, and she underwent a planned vaginal delivery with epidural anaesthesia to minimise sympathetic surge.

obstructive_hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy_012:
  primary_diagnosis: oHCM with Infective Endocarditis
  presenting_complaint: Fever, weight loss, and worsening heart failure.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with oHCM and known mitral valve SAM presented with a two-week history of pyrexia. Transoesophageal echo revealed a 1cm vegetation on the anterior mitral valve leaflet, likely seeded due to the high-velocity jet from the LVOT obstruction. He required a prolonged course of IV antibiotics and subsequent mitral valve repair.

obstructive_hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy_013:
  primary_diagnosis: End-stage (Burn-out) oHCM
  presenting_complaint: Orthopnoea and peripheral oedema.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old patient with a 20-year history of oHCM presented with signs of congestive heart failure. Recent imaging showed the previously hypertrophied walls had thinned and the LV had dilated (LVEF 35%), with a disappearance of the previous LVOT gradient. He was transitioned to standard heart failure therapy (ACE inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors) and referred for transplant assessment.

obstructive_hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy_014:
  primary_diagnosis: oHCM with Hypovolaemic Shock Exacerbation
  presenting_complaint: Profound hypotension following minor surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old with undiagnosed mild oHCM underwent a cholecystectomy. Post-operatively, he became severely hypotensive; administration of Nitroglycerin and diuretics (standard heart failure protocol) worsened his condition by increasing the LVOT gradient ("suction effect"). Diagnosis was made via emergency bedside echo, and he was successfully resuscitated with aggressive fluid boluses and Esmolol.

obstructive_hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy_015:
  primary_diagnosis: oHCM with Multiple Comorbidities
  presenting_complaint: Dizziness and exertional fatigue.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with Type 2 diabetes, COPD, and oHCM presented with worsening stability. Distinguishing between COPD-related dyspnoea and oHCM-related obstruction was challenging. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and stress echo confirmed the primary limitation was cardiac, leading to an increase in his Verapamil dose and optimisation of his glycaemic control.

obstructive_hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy_016:
  primary_diagnosis: oHCM with MYH7 Mutation
  presenting_complaint: Family screening following sudden death of a sibling.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male underwent screening after his brother died aged 24. ECG showed LVH with strain pattern; Echo confirmed 17mm septal thickness and a resting gradient of 30 mmHg. Genetic testing identified a pathogenic variant in the MYH7 gene, and he was started on Nadolol for primary prevention of symptoms and SCD.

obstructive_hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy_017:
  primary_diagnosis: oHCM with Mid-ventricular Obstruction
  presenting_complaint: Atypical chest pain and exertional presyncope.
  summary_of_course: A 47-year-old female was found to have mid-cavity obliteration rather than sub-aortic obstruction on echocardiography. This resulted in a high-pressure apical chamber and a small apical aneurysm. She was started on Diltiazem and advised to avoid dehydration, with follow-up MRI planned to monitor for thrombus formation in the apical aneurysm.

obstructive_hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy_018:
  primary_diagnosis: oHCM with Treatment-Induced Hypotension
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent falls and light-headedness.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female with oHCM and hypertension was treated with a combination of Bisoprolol and Lisinopril. She experienced several falls; investigation revealed that the ACE inhibitor was reducing afterload and worsening her SAM-mediated obstruction. Lisinopril was stopped, and her symptoms resolved as the dynamic gradient stabilised.

obstructive_hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy_019:
  primary_diagnosis: oHCM with Severe Mitral Regurgitation
  presenting_complaint: Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male presented with acute pulmonary congestion. Echo showed oHCM with a 24mm septum and an eccentric, posteriorly directed mitral regurgitation jet caused by severe SAM. He was not a candidate for alcohol ablation due to septal anatomy, so he underwent a combined septal myectomy and mitral valve repair with a ring annuloplasty.

obstructive_hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild oHCM (Stable)
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of a systolic murmur.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male was referred from his GP after a routine insurance medical. Echo showed a 16mm septum and a resting gradient of 22 mmHg, which increased to 35 mmHg with Valsalva. As he was entirely asymptomatic and had no high-risk features for SCD, he was managed conservatively with annual clinical review and echocardiography.
