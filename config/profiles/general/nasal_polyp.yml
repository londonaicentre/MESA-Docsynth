nasal_polyp_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral nasal obstruction and total loss of smell (anosmia).
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented with a 2-year history of progressive nasal blockage and anosmia. Anterior rhinoscopy revealed bilateral, pale, insensitive greyish masses (Grade 2 polyps) originating from the middle meatus. He was treated with a 2-week course of oral prednisolone and long-term fluticasone nasendoscopic drops, resulting in significant shrinkage and restoration of olfaction.

nasal_polyp_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease (Samter's Triad)
  presenting_complaint: Severe recurrent nasal polyps, asthma, and aspirin sensitivity.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female with poorly controlled asthma developed severe nasal congestion and a rash after taking ibuprofen. Examination confirmed Grade 3 bilateral polyposis despite two previous functional endoscopic sinus surgeries (FESS). She was commenced on Dupilumab (biologic therapy) after failing maximal topical therapy, leading to a dramatic reduction in polyp size and improved asthma control.

nasal_polyp_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric nasal polyposis secondary to Cystic Fibrosis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent mouth breathing and thick nasal discharge.
  summary_of_course: A 9-year-old boy with known Cystic Fibrosis presented with chronic nasal obstruction and snoring. Nasendoscopy revealed extensive bilateral polyps filling the nasal cavities. He underwent FESS for symptomatic relief and was started on a rigorous regimen of saline douching and dornase alfa to manage the viscous secretions.

nasal_polyp_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Antrochoanal polyp
  presenting_complaint: Unilateral left-sided nasal obstruction and "popping" sensation.
  summary_of_course: A 17-year-old male reported a 4-month history of worsening left-sided blockage that felt worse on expiration. A large, solitary polyp was seen extending from the maxillary sinus into the nasopharynx on CT imaging. The polyp was successfully removed via an endoscopic approach, with no recurrence noted at the 12-month follow-up.

nasal_polyp_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Inverted Papilloma (Malignancy Mimic)
  presenting_complaint: Unilateral nasal blockage and intermittent epistaxis.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male presented with a fleshy, unilateral mass in the right nasal cavity. Unlike typical inflammatory polyps, this lesion was firm and prone to bleeding (epistaxis). Histopathological examination of a biopsy specimen confirmed an inverted papilloma, and the patient underwent a medial maxillectomy due to the risk of malignant transformation.

nasal_polyp_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of severe facial pain and purulent rhinorrhoea.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female with long-standing mild polyposis presented with acute facial pressure and green nasal discharge. Examination showed infected polyps with pus in the middle meatus. A course of co-amoxiclav and a steroid "burst" resolved the acute infection, followed by a transition back to maintenance topical steroids.

nasal_polyp_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Allergic Fungal Rhinosinusitis (AFRS)
  presenting_complaint: Unilateral proptosis and chronic sinus pressure.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male presented with left-sided eye bulging and nasal congestion. CT imaging showed heterogenous "peanut butter" like material in the ethmoid sinuses with expansion of the sinus walls. He underwent urgent surgical debridement and was placed on a long-term tapering dose of oral steroids to prevent the high rate of recurrence associated with AFRS.

nasal_polyp_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Nasal polyposis with orbital cellulitis
  presenting_complaint: Swollen, painful red eye and restricted eye movement.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male with neglected nasal polyps presented to A&E with left-sided periorbital oedema and ophthalmoplegia. CT revealed a subperiosteal abscess secondary to ethmoid sinusitis and polyposis. He required emergency orbital decompression and FESS, followed by intravenous antibiotics, narrowly avoiding permanent visual loss.

nasal_polyp_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA)
  presenting_complaint: Nasal polyps, asthma, and tingling in the feet.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with a history of late-onset asthma presented with recurrent polyps and new-onset peripheral neuropathy (mononeuritis multiplex). Blood tests showed significant eosinophilia and positive p-ANCA. She was diagnosed with EGPA (formerly Churg-Strauss) and commenced on high-dose systemic corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide.

nasal_polyp_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild inflammatory nasal polyps
  presenting_complaint: Occasional nasal stuffiness and reduced sense of taste.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female presented to her GP with symptoms of a "permanent cold." Small, Grade 1 polyps were visible on anterior rhinoscopy. She was prescribed Mometasone furoate nasal spray for 3 months, which resulted in complete resolution of symptoms and disappearance of the polyps on review.

nasal_polyp_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Woakes' Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Widening of the nasal bridge and total nasal obstruction.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old boy presented with a noticeably widened nasal bridge and chronic mouth breathing. Imaging showed massive, long-standing polyposis causing expansion and thinning of the nasal bones. He required extensive FESS and external nasal splinting to address the structural deformity and restore the airway.

nasal_polyp_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) secondary to polyposis
  presenting_complaint: Excessive daytime sleepiness and heavy snoring.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old obese male was referred for sleep studies which confirmed moderate OSA. ENT examination revealed Grade 3 nasal polyps almost entirely occluding the nasal valve. Following polypectomy and FESS, his Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index (AHI) improved significantly, reducing his reliance on CPAP therapy.

nasal_polyp_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic cough, wet rhinorrhoea, and nasal polyps since childhood.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male with a history of neonatal respiratory distress and bronchiectasis was found to have bilateral nasal polyposis. Ciliary beat frequency studies and genetic testing confirmed PCD. Management involved regular nasal saline irrigations and targeted antibiotics for recurrent sinopulmonary infections.

nasal_polyp_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Nasal polyp with CSF rhinorrhoea (Post-operative complication)
  presenting_complaint: Clear, watery discharge from the right nostril following surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male underwent routine FESS for bilateral polyps. Two days post-operatively, he noticed a salty-tasting clear discharge when leaning forward. Analysis of the fluid confirmed Beta-2 transferrin, indicating a cerebrospinal fluid leak from the ethmoid roof, which required endoscopic skull base repair.

nasal_polyp_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent chest infections and persistent nasal blockage.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female with a history of multiple pneumonias presented with Grade 2 nasal polyps. Immunoglobulin assays revealed low IgG and IgA levels, leading to a diagnosis of CVID. She was managed with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) replacement and topical nasal steroids, which stabilized her sinus disease.

nasal_polyp_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Occupational Rhinosinusitis with polyps
  presenting_complaint: Worsening nasal congestion and sneezing at work.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old woodworker reported that his nasal symptoms were significantly worse during the week. Examination showed inflammatory polyps and mucosal oedema. He was advised on improved PPE and dust extraction, and his symptoms improved with a combination of nasal douching and avoidance of wood dust.

nasal_polyp_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Choanal polyp causing dysphagia
  presenting_complaint: Sensation of a lump in the throat and difficulty swallowing.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female presented with "globus" sensation and intermittent choking. Nasendoscopy revealed a very large posterior choanal polyp hanging into the oropharynx and touching the base of the tongue. The polyp was surgically removed via a transnasal approach, immediately resolving her swallowing difficulties.

nasal_polyp_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent polyposis (Treatment Failure)
  presenting_complaint: Return of nasal blockage 6 months after surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old male with a history of four previous sinus operations presented with rapid recurrence of polyps. Despite maximal medical therapy including steroid-impregnated sinus stents, the polyps returned within months. He was referred to a tertiary centre for consideration of aspirin desensitisation and biologic therapy.

nasal_polyp_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Kartagener's Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Chronic sinusitis, polyps, and known heart-on-the-right-side.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with situs inversus totalis presented with Grade 3 nasal polyps and productive cough. This presentation of Kartagener's Syndrome required a multidisciplinary approach involving ENT and respiratory medicine. He underwent FESS to improve sinus drainage and reduce the bacterial reservoir contributing to his bronchiectasis.

nasal_polyp_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Nasal polyposis with Mucocele
  presenting_complaint: Frontal headache and swelling above the left eye.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with chronic polyposis presented with a firm, non-tender swelling in the left supraorbital region. MRI showed a frontal sinus mucocele caused by polypoid obstruction of the frontal ostium. He underwent image-guided FESS to drain the mucocele and remove the obstructing polyps.
