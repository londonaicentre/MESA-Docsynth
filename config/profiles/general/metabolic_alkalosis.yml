metabolic_alkalosis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis secondary to bulimia nervosa
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent palpitations, muscle weakness, and perioral tingling.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female presented with acute-on-chronic weakness. Laboratory tests revealed a pH of 7.52, HCO3 38 mmol/L, and K+ 2.4 mmol/L. Diagnosis of chloride-responsive metabolic alkalosis due to occult self-induced vomiting was made. She was treated with intravenous 0.9% sodium chloride and potassium supplementation, leading to biochemical resolution before referral to mental health services.

metabolic_alkalosis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Diuretic-induced contraction alkalosis
  presenting_complaint: Worsening shortness of breath and profound lethargy.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with congestive heart failure was over-diuresed with high-dose intravenous furosemide. Admission bloods showed severe dehydration, pH 7.55, and a bicarbonate of 42 mmol/L. Furosemide was withheld and cautious fluid resuscitation with normal saline was initiated. The alkalosis corrected over 72 hours alongside improvement in renal function.

metabolic_alkalosis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Non-bilious, projectile vomiting after feeds.
  summary_of_course: A 6-week-old male infant presented with visible peristalsis and a palpable olive-shaped mass in the epigastrium. Venous blood gas showed classic hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis (Cl- 82 mmol/L, pH 7.58). Preoperative stabilization required aggressive fluid and electrolyte replacement. He subsequently underwent a successful Ramstedt's pyloromyotomy.

metabolic_alkalosis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Gitelman syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Chronic fatigue, salt cravings, and intermittent carpopedal spasms.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old woman with persistent hypokalaemia was investigated in the endocrine clinic. Investigations showed metabolic alkalosis (pH 7.49, HCO3 31 mmol/L) with significant hypomagnesaemia and low urinary calcium excretion. Genetic testing confirmed a SLC12A3 mutation. She remains stable on lifelong magnesium and potassium sparing agents.

metabolic_alkalosis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-hypercapnic metabolic alkalosis
  presenting_complaint: Confusion and twitching following ICU admission for COPD exacerbation.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old smoker was intubated for Type 2 respiratory failure. Rapid correction of chronic hypercapnia via mechanical ventilation led to a residual metabolic alkalosis (pH 7.56, pCO2 5.2 kPa, HCO3 45 mmol/L). Treatment involved reducing the ventilation rate and ensuring adequate chloride intake to allow renal bicarbonate excretion. The alkalosis resolved over 48 hours.

metabolic_alkalosis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's Syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Refractory hypertension and generalized muscle aches.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male on four antihypertensive agents remained hypertensive (175/105 mmHg). Bloods revealed persistent hypokalaemia (3.1 mmol/L) and metabolic alkalosis (HCO3 33 mmol/L). An aldosterone-to-renin ratio was significantly elevated. Adrenal CT confirmed a left-sided adenoma, and he underwent a laparoscopic adrenalectomy, resolving both the hypertension and the alkalosis.

metabolic_alkalosis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Milk-alkali syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Nausea, polyuria, and acute kidney injury.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old woman with osteoporosis self-medicated with high doses of calcium carbonate and indigestion tablets. She presented with a pH of 7.53, hypercalcaemia (3.2 mmol/L), and creatinine of 210 umol/L. The triad of hypercalcaemia, alkalosis, and renal failure confirmed the diagnosis. She was treated with aggressive saline hydration and cessation of calcium supplements.

metabolic_alkalosis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Nasogastric suction-induced metabolic alkalosis
  presenting_complaint: Post-operative ileus with high-volume gastric drainage.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male following a bowel resection required continuous NG suction for five days. Loss of gastric hydrochloric acid resulted in a pH of 7.51 and HCO3 36 mmol/L. Intravenous fluids were switched from 5% dextrose to 0.9% sodium chloride with added potassium. The metabolic derangement corrected as the ileus resolved and suctioning was tapered.

metabolic_alkalosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Ectopic ACTH secretion (Small cell lung cancer)
  presenting_complaint: Severe muscle weakness and dark skin pigmentation.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old smoker presented with acute proximal myopathy. Biochemistry revealed profound hypokalaemia (1.9 mmol/L) and severe metabolic alkalosis (HCO3 48 mmol/L). Dexamethasone suppression testing and CT chest suggested a paraneoplastic Cushing's syndrome secondary to lung malignancy. Metyrapone was started to inhibit steroid synthesis while awaiting chemotherapy.

metabolic_alkalosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Cystic Fibrosis-associated heatstroke alkalosis
  presenting_complaint: Collapse and dehydration during a UK heatwave.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old girl with Cystic Fibrosis presented with signs of heat exhaustion. Excessive salt loss through sweat resulted in a contraction alkalosis and hypovolaemia (pH 7.50, Cl- 88 mmol/L). She required intensive rehydration with hypertonic saline and potassium. This case highlighted the risk of "pseudo-Bartter" presentation in CF patients during high ambient temperatures.

metabolic_alkalosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Surreptitious laxative abuse
  presenting_complaint: Chronic watery diarrhoea and unexplained weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old nursing student was admitted for investigation of chronic hypokalaemia and metabolic alkalosis. Initial suspicion of Bartter syndrome was refuted by a low urinary chloride (<10 mmol/L). A stool screen for phenolphthalein was positive, confirming surreptitious laxative use. The alkalosis was a result of chronic volume depletion and secondary hyperaldosteronism.

metabolic_alkalosis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Antenatal Bartter Syndrome (Type I)
  presenting_complaint: Polyhydramnios and premature birth at 30 weeks.
  summary_of_course: A neonate presented with profound polyuria and failure to thrive. Laboratory findings showed severe hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis and hypercalciuria. Genetic testing confirmed a mutation in the SLC12A1 gene. Treatment involved lifelong high-dose sodium and potassium chloride supplements and indomethacin to reduce prostaglandin-mediated salt wasting.

metabolic_alkalosis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Pseudo-hyperaldosteronism due to liquorice ingestion
  presenting_complaint: Headache and leg oedema.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old man presented with a BP of 190/110 mmHg and a pH of 7.48. History revealed daily consumption of 200g of natural black liquorice containing glycyrrhizic acid. This substance inhibits 11-beta-HSD2, causing cortisol to activate mineralocorticoid receptors. Alkalosis and hypertension resolved four weeks after total cessation of liquorice intake.

metabolic_alkalosis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Renovascular hypertension (Renal Artery Stenosis)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset pulmonary oedema and uncontrolled BP.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old female with known peripheral vascular disease presented with "flash" pulmonary oedema. Bloods showed a pH of 7.49 and HCO3 32 mmol/L. Renal artery duplex showed 80% stenosis of the right renal artery. The resulting activation of the RAAS led to secondary hyperaldosteronism and metabolic alkalosis, which improved following renal artery stenting.

metabolic_alkalosis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Villous Adenoma of the Rectum
  presenting_complaint: Profuse mucoid rectal discharge and falls.
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old male presented with "pseudodiarrhoea" consisting of clear mucus. He was found to have a pH of 7.52 and a K+ of 2.2 mmol/L. A large rectal villous adenoma was identified on colonoscopy. The tumour's secretory activity caused significant potassium and fluid loss, leading to metabolic alkalosis. He underwent a successful transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEMS).

metabolic_alkalosis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Liddle Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Early-onset hypertension in a 19-year-old.
  summary_of_course: A university student was found to have a BP of 180/100 mmHg during a routine screening. Investigations showed suppressed renin and aldosterone, but persistent metabolic alkalosis (HCO3 34 mmol/L) and hypokalaemia. Genetic screening identified a mutation in the ENaC subunit. He responded rapidly to amiloride therapy, which directly inhibits the overactive epithelial sodium channels.

metabolic_alkalosis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Massive Citrate Transfusion Alkalosis
  presenting_complaint: Hypovolaemic shock following major trauma.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male received 15 units of packed red cells and 10 units of FFP following a road traffic accident. Post-stabilisation, he developed a metabolic alkalosis (pH 7.54, HCO3 39 mmol/L). The citrate anticoagulant in the blood products was metabolised by the liver into bicarbonate. The condition was self-limiting and resolved as the citrate load was cleared and renal excretion caught up.

metabolic_alkalosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Hyperemesis Gravidarum
  presenting_complaint: Intractable vomiting at 10 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old G1P0 presented with 5kg weight loss and ketonuria. Blood gas showed a pH of 7.56 and a chloride of 84 mmol/L, consistent with metabolic alkalosis from gastric acid loss. She was managed with aggressive IV thiamine, normal saline, and antiemetics. Her electrolytes and acid-base balance normalised over five days of inpatient care.

metabolic_alkalosis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Thiazide-induced metabolic alkalosis
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue and muscle cramps during a summer holiday.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old woman recently started on bendroflumethiazide for hypertension presented to her GP. In the context of mild dehydration, her HCO3 was 35 mmol/L and K+ 2.9 mmol/L. The diuretic was stopped and she was advised on oral rehydration. Repeat bloods one week later showed a return to a normal pH of 7.41 and HCO3 26 mmol/L.

metabolic_alkalosis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe, life-threatening alkalosis with tetany
  presenting_complaint: Seizures and carpopedal spasm.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with a history of alcohol excess and severe protracted vomiting presented in status epilepticus. Arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.68 and HCO3 58 mmol/L. The extreme alkalosis caused a shift in ionized calcium, leading to tetany and seizures. He required sedation, intubation, and urgent intravenous hydrochloric acid infusion via a central line in the ICU to rapidly lower the pH.
