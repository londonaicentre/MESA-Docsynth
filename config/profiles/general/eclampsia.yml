eclampsia_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Antepartum eclampsia
  presenting_complaint: Tonic-clonic seizure at 30 weeks gestation
  summary_of_course: A 17-year-old primigravida presented via ambulance following a witnessed generalised seizure at home. On arrival, BP was 174/112 mmHg with 3+ proteinuria on dipstick. She was treated with a loading dose of intravenous magnesium sulphate and underwent an emergency category 1 caesarean section; both mother and neonate were stabilised in HDU/NICU.

eclampsia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Postpartum eclampsia
  presenting_complaint: New-onset seizure six days after delivery
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female presented to A&E with a severe frontal headache and visual scotoma, followed by a tonic-clonic seizure in the waiting room. She had been discharged four days prior following an uncomplicated vaginal delivery. Investigations confirmed hypertension (165/105 mmHg) and she was managed with a 24-hour magnesium sulphate infusion and oral labetalol.

eclampsia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Intrapartum eclampsia
  presenting_complaint: Seizure during the second stage of labour
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old at 39 weeks gestation developed a seizure while pushing during the second stage of labour. She had no prior history of hypertension, but intra-seizure BP was 185/120 mmHg. An instrumental forceps delivery was performed immediately, and she was transferred to the obstetric high dependency unit for blood pressure control and seizure prophylaxis.

eclampsia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Eclampsia with HELLP syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Epigastric pain, nausea, and seizure at 33 weeks
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female presented with severe RUQ pain and vomiting, initially suspected to be gallstones, before suffering a generalised seizure. Bloods revealed ALT 480 U/L, platelets 55 x 10^9/L, and fragmented cells on film, confirming HELLP syndrome. She received magnesium sulphate, dexamethasone, and urgent delivery, with recovery requiring a platelet transfusion.

eclampsia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Eclampsia complicated by placental abruption
  presenting_complaint: Sudden abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and collapse
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old at 36 weeks gestation presented with a woody-hard uterus and heavy bleeding, followed by a seizure. Ultrasound confirmed a large retroplacental haematoma and fetal demise. She was treated for eclampsia and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with blood products and magnesium sulphate.

eclampsia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Eclampsia in chronic hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Seizure at 32 weeks gestation with known HTN
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old with pre-existing chronic hypertension managed on nifedipine presented with a sudden seizure. Admission BP was 210/130 mmHg with significant new-onset proteinuria (PCR 450 mg/mmol). Diagnosis of superimposed pre-eclampsia with eclampsia was made, requiring intravenous hydralazine and magnesium sulphate before delivery.

eclampsia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Eclampsia presenting as status epilepticus
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent seizures without regaining consciousness
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old at 31 weeks gestation was brought to A&E after three consecutive seizures at home. She remained post-ictal and hypertensive (180/115 mmHg) on arrival. She required intubation, ventilation, and a magnesium sulphate bolus followed by an infusion to control the status eclampticus before emergency delivery.

eclampsia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Eclampsia in twin pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Flashing lights and seizure at 29 weeks
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old with a diamniotic dichorionic twin pregnancy presented with rapid-onset peripheral oedema and visual disturbances, culminating in a seizure in the antenatal clinic. Given the early gestation and maternal instability, she was stabilised with magnesium sulphate and delivered via emergency caesarean section. Both infants required prolonged NICU care for prematurity.

eclampsia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Eclampsia with Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES)
  presenting_complaint: Seizure followed by persistent confusion and visual loss
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old at 37 weeks gestation suffered a seizure and remained confused with bilateral visual field deficits post-ictally. MRI brain showed characteristic white matter oedema in the posterior cerebral hemispheres consistent with PRES. Symptoms and radiological changes resolved over two weeks following delivery and BP control.

eclampsia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Eclampsia in an older primigravida
  presenting_complaint: Severe headache and seizure at 35 weeks
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old primigravida (IVF pregnancy) presented with a three-day history of worsening headache and a sudden seizure. She had been monitoring her BP at home, which had risen to 155/98 mmHg. Following the seizure, she was started on magnesium sulphate and delivered via caesarean section, with a slow recovery of renal function post-delivery.

eclampsia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Eclampsia mimicking epilepsy
  presenting_complaint: Seizure at 32 weeks in a patient with known epilepsy
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old with well-controlled focal epilepsy presented with a generalised seizure. Initially treated as an epilepsy breakthrough, the discovery of BP 178/112 mmHg and 4+ proteinuria shifted the diagnosis to eclampsia. She was successfully managed with magnesium sulphate, which is superior to standard anti-epileptics for this pathology.

eclampsia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Eclampsia with acute kidney injury
  presenting_complaint: Seizure followed by oliguria at 34 weeks
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female presented with a seizure and was found to have a serum creatinine of 245 μmol/L and minimal urine output. Management was complicated by the need for careful fluid restriction to prevent pulmonary oedema while maintaining renal perfusion. Following delivery and magnesium therapy, her renal function returned to baseline over ten days.

eclampsia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Eclampsia with acute pulmonary oedema
  presenting_complaint: Seizure and severe shortness of breath
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old at 36 weeks gestation presented with a seizure followed by acute respiratory distress and frothy sputum. Oxygen saturations were 86% on room air with widespread crackles on auscultation. She required CPAP ventilation, intravenous furosemide, and magnesium sulphate for combined eclampsia and acute heart failure.

eclampsia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Late postpartum eclampsia
  presenting_complaint: Seizure 14 days after hospital discharge
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old presented to the emergency department 2 weeks postpartum with a generalised seizure. Although late presentations are rare, her BP was 160/100 mmHg and she had no prior seizure history. She was admitted for 24 hours of magnesium sulphate and commenced on oral amlodipine, with no further neurological events.

eclampsia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Eclampsia in unbooked pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Community collapse and seizure at term
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old with no previous antenatal care was brought in by paramedics after a seizure in a public space. Examination suggested a term pregnancy, BP 190/120 mmHg, and significant pedal oedema. She was immediately started on the Pritchard regimen (IM/IV magnesium sulphate) and underwent an emergency delivery.

eclampsia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Eclampsia with cortical blindness
  presenting_complaint: Sudden seizure followed by total loss of vision
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old at 32 weeks gestation presented with a seizure and subsequent complaint of being unable to see anything despite normal pupillary reflexes. Fundoscopy was unremarkable, suggesting cortical blindness secondary to eclamptic encephalopathy. Her vision fully returned 48 hours after delivery and blood pressure stabilisation.

eclampsia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Eclampsia despite magnesium prophylaxis
  presenting_complaint: Breakthrough seizure while on magnesium sulphate infusion
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old with severe pre-eclampsia was already receiving IV magnesium sulphate when she experienced a generalised seizure. A further 2g bolus of magnesium was administered and serum levels were checked (found to be sub-therapeutic). She was moved to an immediate caesarean section to prevent further maternal morbidity.

eclampsia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Eclampsia in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
  presenting_complaint: Seizure at 28 weeks gestation with known SLE nephritis
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old with SLE and pre-existing proteinuria presented with a seizure. Differentiating between a lupus flare and eclampsia was challenging, but the acute rise in BP to 180/110 mmHg and low C3/C4 levels suggested overlapping pathology. She was treated with magnesium sulphate and high-dose steroids, followed by urgent delivery.

eclampsia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Eclampsia complicated by intracranial haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Seizure followed by reduced GCS and hemiparesis
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old at 34 weeks gestation suffered a seizure followed by a GCS of 7 and right-sided weakness. A CT head revealed a large left-sided intracerebral haemorrhage. She underwent an emergency craniotomy and caesarean section simultaneously, followed by a prolonged recovery period in neuro-ICU.

eclampsia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Atypical early-onset eclampsia
  presenting_complaint: Seizure at 23 weeks gestation
  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old presented with a seizure at just 23 weeks gestation, which is exceptionally early for eclampsia. Investigations confirmed severe hypertension and proteinuria, and she was diagnosed with atypical eclampsia. Due to the extreme risk to maternal life, the pregnancy was terminated after maternal stabilisation with magnesium sulphate and antihypertensives.
