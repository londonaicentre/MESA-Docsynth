gilbert_syndrome_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Gilbert syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Scleral icterus following a viral upper respiratory tract infection
  summary_of_course: A 17-year-old male presented to his GP with yellowing of the eyes after a week of coryzal symptoms and reduced oral intake. Blood tests revealed an isolated bilirubin of 52 micromol/L with normal ALT, ALP, and albumin, and no evidence of haemolysis on a full blood count. He was diagnosed with Gilbert syndrome and reassured that no treatment was necessary.

gilbert_syndrome_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Gilbert syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Post-operative jaundice following prolonged fasting
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old female underwent an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstones. On the first post-operative day, she appeared mildly jaundiced after being nil-by-mouth for 18 hours. Investigations showed an unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia of 64 micromol/L with normal liver enzymes and a negative direct antiglobulin test.

gilbert_syndrome_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Gilbert syndrome with Irinotecan toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Severe diarrhoea and neutropenia following chemotherapy
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with metastatic colorectal cancer experienced life-threatening grade 4 neutropenia and profuse diarrhoea after his first cycle of FOLFIRI. Retrospective genetic testing confirmed a UGT1A1*28 homozygous polymorphism, identifying underlying Gilbert syndrome which impaired irinotecan metabolism. His chemotherapy dose was subsequently reduced by 25% for future cycles.

gilbert_syndrome_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Gilbert syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of mild jaundice during exam stress
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old university student reported intermittent yellowing of the sclera coinciding with periods of high stress and sleep deprivation. Physical examination was unremarkable except for mild icterus. Repeated blood tests showed bilirubin levels fluctuating between 22 and 48 micromol/L, confirming a chronic, benign course of Gilbert syndrome.

gilbert_syndrome_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Gilbert syndrome co-inherited with Hereditary Spherocytosis
  presenting_complaint: Significant jaundice and fatigue
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female with known hereditary spherocytosis presented with a higher-than-usual bilirubin level of 95 micromol/L during a minor chest infection. The disproportionate jaundice compared to her stable haemoglobin suggested a second pathology. Genetic screening confirmed co-inherited Gilbert syndrome, explaining the exaggerated hyperbilirubinaemia during haemolytic episodes.

gilbert_syndrome_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Gilbert syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Persistent neonatal jaundice
  summary_of_course: A 3-week-old breastfed infant presented with lingering jaundice despite normal weight gain and no signs of kernicterus. Investigations ruled out biliary atresia and ABO incompatibility, showing isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. The jaundice resolved slowly, and a family history of Gilbert syndrome in the father supported a presumptive diagnosis.

gilbert_syndrome_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Gilbert syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Incidental hyperbilirubinaemia on routine insurance medical
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old healthy woman underwent a routine health screen for life insurance which identified a bilirubin of 38 micromol/L. She was asymptomatic with no history of liver disease or alcohol excess. A repeat fasting bilirubin was 45 micromol/L, while a post-prandial sample was 19 micromol/L, characteristic of Gilbert syndrome.

gilbert_syndrome_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Gilbert syndrome exacerbated by Atazanavir
  presenting_complaint: Visible jaundice after starting new HIV medication
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male living with HIV was commenced on a regimen including atazanavir. Within two weeks, he developed significant scleral icterus with a bilirubin of 88 micromol/L. As his transaminases remained normal and he was otherwise well, the jaundice was attributed to atazanavir-inhibited UGT1A1 activity in the context of pre-existing Gilbert syndrome.

gilbert_syndrome_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Gilbert syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice and abdominal discomfort following a marathon
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old amateur athlete presented to A&E with mild right upper quadrant ache and yellow eyes after completing a marathon. Dehydration and physical exertion had triggered a spike in bilirubin to 72 micromol/L. After intravenous rehydration and rest, his bilirubin returned to his baseline of 28 micromol/L within 48 hours.

gilbert_syndrome_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Gilbert syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Anxiety regarding persistent "yellow eyes"
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male presented with significant social anxiety, fearing that his intermittent scleral icterus suggested chronic liver failure or hepatitis. Despite multiple normal LFTs (aside from bilirubin), he requested a liver biopsy. He was managed in the outpatient clinic with education about the benign nature of Gilbert syndrome and psychological support for his health anxiety.

gilbert_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Gilbert syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice following a period of heavy alcohol consumption
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male noticed jaundice on a Monday morning following a weekend of binge drinking and poor oral intake. Initial concerns for alcoholic hepatitis were dismissed when ALT and GGT were found to be within normal limits. The unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia resolved rapidly with cessation of alcohol and normal diet, consistent with Gilbert syndrome.

gilbert_syndrome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Gilbert syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Severe jaundice during acute gastroenteritis
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male was admitted with severe vomiting and diarrhoea due to Norovirus. He was noted to be deeply jaundiced with a bilirubin of 110 micromol/L. Investigations showed no evidence of biliary obstruction or haemolysis, and the bilirubin level halved within 24 hours of commencing IV fluids and resuming light snacks.

gilbert_syndrome_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Gilbert syndrome in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice in the first trimester
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old pregnant woman with hyperemesis gravidarum developed mild jaundice at 10 weeks gestation. While initially concerned about obstetric cholestasis, her bile acids were normal and the bilirubin was entirely unconjugated. The diagnosis of Gilbert syndrome was made, exacerbated by the caloric restriction caused by her severe morning sickness.

gilbert_syndrome_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Gilbert syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice during an episode of thyrotoxicosis
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female with Graves' disease presented with palpitations, weight loss, and scleral icterus. Her bilirubin was 55 micromol/L, which was unusual for uncomplicated hyperthyroidism. Treatment with carbimazole achieved a euthyroid state, and her bilirubin levels subsequently fell to near-normal, identifying Gilbert syndrome triggered by the metabolic stress of thyrotoxicosis.

gilbert_syndrome_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Gilbert syndrome in the ICU setting
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice in a patient with septic shock
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male was admitted to the ICU with urosepsis and hypotension. He developed jaundice on day three with a bilirubin of 92 micromol/L, but other liver parameters showed only mild "shock liver" changes. The degree of hyperbilirubinaemia was disproportionate to the transaminases, and post-recovery testing confirmed a baseline Gilbert syndrome.

gilbert_syndrome_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Gilbert syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent jaundice and vague abdominal pain
  summary_of_course: An 11-year-old boy was referred to paediatricians for episodes of "looking yellow" and mild periumbilical pain during viral illnesses. Extensive workup for Wilson's disease and autoimmune hepatitis was negative. A diagnosis of Gilbert syndrome was made based on isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia and a positive family history in his mother.

gilbert_syndrome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Gilbert syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice during a low-carbohydrate diet
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old female started a strict ketogenic diet for weight loss and noticed yellowing of her eyes within two weeks. Blood tests confirmed an unconjugated bilirubin of 49 micromol/L. The jaundice resolved when she increased her carbohydrate intake, demonstrating the effect of caloric and carbohydrate restriction on bilirubin conjugation in Gilbert syndrome.

gilbert_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Gilbert syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Scleral icterus in a patient with Anorexia Nervosa
  summary_of_course: A 20-year-old female was admitted to an eating disorder unit with a BMI of 14.5. She was noted to be jaundiced with a bilirubin of 60 micromol/L. As her nutritional status improved with a structured refeeding programme, her bilirubin levels returned to the normal range, confirming the diagnosis of Gilbert syndrome triggered by starvation.

gilbert_syndrome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Gilbert syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Cyclical jaundice associated with menstruation
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old woman noticed that she appeared mildly jaundiced every month just before her period began. Blood tests during the luteal phase showed a bilirubin of 42 micromol/L, while mid-cycle tests were normal. This rare presentation of Gilbert syndrome was attributed to hormonal fluctuations affecting UGT1A1 enzyme efficiency.

gilbert_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Gilbert syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Diagnostic confusion with acute hepatitis
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male presented to A&E with jaundice and malaise. He was initially triaged as suspected acute hepatitis; however, his viral serology (A, B, C, E) and autoimmune screen were negative. The discovery that his bilirubin was 80% unconjugated and his ALT was only 35 U/L led to the diagnosis of Gilbert syndrome triggered by a recent bout of tonsillitis.
