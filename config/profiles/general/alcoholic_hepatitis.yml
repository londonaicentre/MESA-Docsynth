alcoholic_hepatitis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute alcoholic hepatitis in the elderly
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent falls and worsening confusion

  primary_diagnosis: Steroid-refractory severe alcoholic hepatitis
  presenting_complaint: Worsening jaundice despite hospital treatment
  summary_of_course: A 49-year-old male was started on prednisolone for severe alcoholic hepatitis (MDF 52). On day 7 of treatment, his Lille score was calculated at 0.72, indicating steroid non-response.

  presenting_complaint: Profound fatigue and dark urine
  summary_of_course: A 43-year-old male with a history of past intravenous drug use and current heavy alcohol intake presented with a bilirubin of 210 µmol/L. Diagnostic challenge arose in differentiating the primary driver of liver injury; however, the AST:ALT ratio of 4:1 and neutrophilia favoured alcoholic hepatitis. He was stabilised before being referred for direct-acting antiviral therapy for his HCV.

alcoholic_hepatitis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute alcoholic hepatitis with malnutrition
  presenting_complaint: Significant weight loss and muscle wasting
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female presented with a 15kg weight loss and sarcopenia despite a high-calorie liquid diet (cider).

  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male with Type 2 Diabetes and a BMI of 34 presented with deranged LFTs. He admitted to drinking 40 units of beer weekly. Liver biopsy showed features of both metabolic dysfunction and alcohol-related injury, including Mallory-Denk bodies and pericellular fibrosis, requiring a dual-pronged management strategy.

  primary_diagnosis: Mild alcoholic hepatitis (Community-managed)
  presenting_complaint: Itchy skin and pale stools
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female visited her GP complaining of pruritus and change in bowel habit. Bloods revealed a cholestatic pattern with a bilirubin of 38 µmol/L and GGT 600 U/L.

  presenting_complaint: Severe epigastric pain radiating to the back
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented with agonizing abdominal pain and vomiting. Serum amylase was 1400 U/L and bilirubin was 95 µmol/L with an AST:ALT ratio of 3.5. CT abdomen confirmed interstitial oedematous pancreatitis, and he was managed with aggressive fluid resuscitation, analgesia, and monitoring for worsening liver failure.

  presenting_complaint: Decreased urine output and jaundice
  summary_of_course: A 53-year-old female presented with a bilirubin of 400 µmol/L and a rising creatinine of 190 µmol/L.
