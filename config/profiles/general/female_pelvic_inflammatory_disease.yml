female_pelvic_inflammatory_disease_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute uncomplicated Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral lower abdominal pain and increased vaginal discharge.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female presented to her GP with a 5-day history of pelvic pain and deep dyspareunia. Examination revealed cervical motion tenderness and a temperature of 37.8°C; high vaginal swabs were positive for Chlamydia trachomatis. She was successfully managed in the community with a 14-day course of oral doxycycline, metronidazole, and a single IM ceftriaxone injection.

female_pelvic_inflammatory_disease_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Tubo-ovarian Abscess (TOA)
  presenting_complaint: Severe left-sided pelvic pain, rigors, and vomiting.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female presented to A&E with acute-onset pelvic pain and a fever of 39.2°C. Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) identified a 6cm complex multiloculated mass in the left adnexa and raised inflammatory markers (CRP 145). She was admitted for intravenous fluids and parenteral antibiotics (ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and doxycycline), showing significant clinical improvement within 48 hours without needing surgical drainage.

female_pelvic_inflammatory_disease_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Fitz-Hugh-Curtis Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Sharp right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain and pleuritic chest pain.
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old female was initially investigated for cholecystitis due to severe RUQ tenderness and a positive Murphy's sign. Further history revealed recent pelvic discomfort and laparoscopy demonstrated "violin-string" adhesions between the liver capsule and the anterior abdominal wall. A diagnosis of perihepatitis secondary to subacute PID was made, and she was treated with standard antibiotic protocols.

female_pelvic_inflammatory_disease_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Pelvic Inflammatory Disease with Hydrosalpinx
  presenting_complaint: Persistent dull pelvic ache and secondary infertility.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female presented to a fertility clinic after two years of unsuccessful conception. Hysterosalpingogram (HSG) showed bilateral distal tubal occlusion and dilated fallopian tubes consistent with hydrosalpinx. She had a historical untreated episode of pelvic pain three years prior, and she subsequently underwent bilateral salpingectomy to improve her chances of success with IVF.

female_pelvic_inflammatory_disease_005:
  primary_diagnosis: IUD-associated Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (Actinomyces)
  presenting_complaint: Intermenstrual bleeding and pelvic heaviness.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female with a Copper IUD in situ for seven years presented with persistent spotting and pelvic discomfort. Cervical cytology showed Actinomyces-like organisms, and TVUS confirmed thickened fallopian tubes. The IUD was removed, and she was treated with a prolonged course of penicillin G followed by oral amoxicillin, resulting in resolution of symptoms.

female_pelvic_inflammatory_disease_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-abortal Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
  presenting_complaint: Heavy vaginal bleeding, foul-smelling lochia, and fever.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female presented ten days following a medical termination of pregnancy with worsening abdominal cramps and pyrexia. Examination showed an open cervical os and exquisite uterine tenderness, with swabs growing a polymicrobial mix including anaerobes. She required admission for IV antibiotics and a suction curettage to remove retained products of conception that were acting as a nidus for infection.

female_pelvic_inflammatory_disease_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe PID with Septic Shock
  presenting_complaint: Collapse, high fever, and generalised abdominal guarding.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female was brought to the ICU with hypotension (80/40 mmHg) and tachycardia following a week of untreated pelvic pain. Imaging revealed a ruptured right-sided tubo-ovarian abscess with significant free fluid and signs of peritonitis. She underwent an emergency laparotomy and salpingo-oophorectomy alongside vasopressor support and broad-spectrum IV antibiotics, eventually recovering after a 10-day hospital stay.

female_pelvic_inflammatory_disease_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Mycoplasma genitalium-associated PID
  presenting_complaint: Persistent pelvic pain despite initial antibiotic treatment.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female returned to the sexual health clinic after failing to respond to a standard ceftriaxone and doxycycline regimen. Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) was positive for Mycoplasma genitalium, which was found to be macrolide-resistant. She was successfully treated with a 10-day course of moxifloxacin, highlighting the need for specific pathogen identification in refractory cases.

female_pelvic_inflammatory_disease_009:
  primary_diagnosis: PID in an Adolescent (Safeguarding concern)
  presenting_complaint: Lower abdominal pain and dysuria.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old girl presented to the paediatric A&E with acute pelvic pain and a purulent discharge. Examination under sedation was required due to distress, revealing significant cervicitis; swabs were positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Treatment was initiated alongside a formal safeguarding assessment and referral to social services to investigate the circumstances of her sexual activity.

female_pelvic_inflammatory_disease_010:
  primary_diagnosis: PID secondary to Enteric Flora (Post-menopausal)
  presenting_complaint: New onset pelvic pain and altered bowel habit.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old post-menopausal female presented with symptoms mimicking diverticulitis, but imaging showed bilateral salpingitis. Investigations revealed a colovesical fistula secondary to diverticular disease which had allowed enteric organisms (E. coli and Streptococcus anginosus) to ascend the genital tract. She required a combination of gynaecological and colorectal surgical intervention to resolve the underlying cause.

female_pelvic_inflammatory_disease_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic PID with Pelvic Peritonitis
  presenting_complaint: Exacerbation of chronic pelvic pain with new-onset rigors.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female with a history of recurrent PID presented with "rebound" tenderness in the lower quadrants. CT imaging showed extensive inflammatory changes and "stranding" of the pelvic fat, suggesting acute peritonitis. She was managed with aggressive IV antibiotic therapy and underwent laparoscopic adhesiolysis after the acute infection subsided to manage her chronic pain.

female_pelvic_inflammatory_disease_012:
  primary_diagnosis: PID mimicking Acute Appendicitis
  presenting_complaint: Migratory right iliac fossa pain and nausea.
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old female was taken to theatre for a suspected appendicectomy after presenting with classical right-sided pain and a raised white cell count. Intraoperatively, the appendix was found to be normal, but the right fallopian tube was hyperaemic and discharging pus from the fimbria. The diagnosis was revised to acute PID, and she was started on appropriate IV antibiotics post-operatively.

female_pelvic_inflammatory_disease_013:
  primary_diagnosis: PID in Pregnancy (First Trimester)
  presenting_complaint: Pelvic pain and vaginal spotting at 8 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old female presented with symptoms initially thought to be a threatened miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy. Ultrasound confirmed a viable intrauterine pregnancy but also showed thickened, fluid-filled fallopian tubes and a small pelvic collection. Due to the rarity and risk of fetal loss, she was admitted for close monitoring and treated with IV clindamycin and gentamicin, which are safer profiles in early pregnancy.

female_pelvic_inflammatory_disease_014:
  primary_diagnosis: PID with Pelvic Thrombophlebitis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent spiking fevers despite 72 hours of IV antibiotics.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old female was being treated for severe PID and a known TOA but failed to defervesce despite appropriate antimicrobial coverage. Repeat MRI imaging identified a thrombus within the right ovarian vein, consistent with septic pelvic thrombophlebitis. Her treatment plan was expanded to include therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin, after which her fevers rapidly resolved.

female_pelvic_inflammatory_disease_015:
  primary_diagnosis: HIV-associated Refractory PID
  presenting_complaint: Chronic malodorous discharge and weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female with poorly controlled HIV (CD4 count 150) presented with recurrent, multi-pathogen PID. Her clinical course was complicated by the presence of multiple small abscesses that were slow to respond to standard therapy. She required an extended 21-day course of triple-antibiotic therapy and optimization of her antiretroviral therapy (ART) to achieve clinical resolution.

female_pelvic_inflammatory_disease_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Subclinical Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
  presenting_complaint: No acute symptoms; incidental finding during laparoscopy.
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old female underwent diagnostic laparoscopy for investigation of primary infertility. The surgeon noted extensive "silent" adhesions and bilateral tubal scarring despite the patient having no prior history of acute pelvic pain or STI diagnosis. Endometrial biopsy later confirmed histological evidence of chronic plasma cell endometritis, and she was treated with a course of doxycycline to clear the presumed subclinical infection.

female_pelvic_inflammatory_disease_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-hysteroscopy Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
  presenting_complaint: Severe uterine cramping and fever 48 hours post-procedure.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female underwent an outpatient hysteroscopy and polyp resection. Two days later, she developed a temperature of 38.5°C and significant pelvic tenderness. She was diagnosed with iatrogenic PID caused by the introduction of vaginal flora into the uterine cavity and responded well to a standard 14-day antibiotic regimen.

female_pelvic_inflammatory_disease_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent PID due to Partner Notification Failure
  presenting_complaint: Third episode of pelvic pain in twelve months.
  summary_of_course: A 20-year-old female presented with recurrent Chlamydial PID despite documented treatment compliance. Detailed history-taking revealed that her primary partner had refused testing and treatment, leading to repeated re-infection (ping-pong effect). Management focused on intensive health education, facilitated partner notification via the sexual health clinic, and a repeat course of antibiotics for the patient.

female_pelvic_inflammatory_disease_019:
  primary_diagnosis: PID with Endometriosis Overlap
  presenting_complaint: Worsening of "usual" period pain and new-onset fever.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old female with known Stage IV endometriosis presented with an acute exacerbation of pelvic pain that felt different from her usual cyclic symptoms. Examination and bloods showed an elevated CRP (90) and leucocytosis, which were not typical for her endometriosis flares. She was diagnosed with acute PID superimposed on her endometriosis and required inpatient IV antibiotics to prevent the infection from involving her pre-existing endometriotic cysts.

female_pelvic_inflammatory_disease_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe PID with Pyosalpinx
  presenting_complaint: Acute lower abdominal pain and inability to pass urine.
  summary_of_course: A 23-year-old female presented with urinary retention secondary to severe pelvic pain and inflammation. TVUS demonstrated bilateral pyosalpinx (fallopian tubes distended with pus) but no discrete abscess. She was treated with IV antibiotics and required a temporary urinary catheter; her symptoms resolved without surgical intervention, though follow-up imaging was scheduled to monitor for hydrosalpinx.
