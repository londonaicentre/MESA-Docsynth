acute_hepatitis_a_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis A
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice and dark urine
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old male presented with a 3-day history of low-grade fever, abdominal pain, and subsequent icterus. Serology confirmed HAV IgM positivity with an ALT of 850 U/L. The condition was mild and self-limiting, managed with supportive care in the community, resulting in full clinical recovery within two weeks.

acute_hepatitis_a_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis A
  presenting_complaint: Nausea, vomiting, and right upper quadrant pain
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female returned from a backpacking trip to South Asia with significant malaise and anorexia. Investigations showed an ALT of 2400 U/L and bilirubin of 85 µmol/L; HAV IgM was reactive. She was managed as an outpatient with regular LFT monitoring, showing gradual resolution over six weeks.

acute_hepatitis_a_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Fulminant Hepatitis A
  presenting_complaint: Altered mental status and severe jaundice
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male with no prior medical history presented with rapid-onset encephalopathy and a coagulopathy (INR 3.5). Admission to ICU was required for Grade III hepatic encephalopathy following acute HAV infection. He received N-acetylcysteine infusion and intensive monitoring, narrowly avoiding the need for a liver transplant as hepatic function began to improve on day 5.

acute_hepatitis_a_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Cholestatic Hepatitis A
  presenting_complaint: Persistent intense pruritus and deep jaundice
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male developed prolonged jaundice lasting over 12 weeks following an acute HAV infection. Despite resolving transaminases, his bilirubin remained elevated at 350 µmol/L with debilitating itching. A course of prednisolone was initiated to accelerate recovery of cholestasis, leading to symptomatic improvement.

acute_hepatitis_a_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Relapsing Hepatitis A
  presenting_complaint: Recurrence of jaundice after initial recovery
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female experienced an initial bout of acute hepatitis A which appeared to resolve clinically. Six weeks later, she presented with a second peak of ALT (1200 U/L) and jaundice. This relapsing variant was confirmed via persistent HAV IgM and exclusion of other causes; the second episode resolved spontaneously without complications.

acute_hepatitis_a_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis A with Acute Kidney Injury
  presenting_complaint: Reduced urine output and yellowing of the eyes
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male presented with severe dehydration and jaundice following a week of diarrhoea and vomiting. Bloods revealed HAV IgM positivity and a creatinine of 210 µmol/L, consistent with pre-renal AKI secondary to hepatitis-related fluid loss. Intravenous rehydration led to the resolution of renal impairment while LFTs gradually normalised.

acute_hepatitis_a_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis A in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Epigastric pain and malaise in the third trimester
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old pregnant female (34 weeks gestation) presented with symptoms mimicking pre-eclampsia. Investigations showed significantly elevated transaminases and positive HAV serology, while blood pressure and proteinuria remained normal. She was closely monitored by a multidisciplinary team; she delivered a healthy neonate at term with no evidence of vertical transmission.

acute_hepatitis_a_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis A with Haemolysis
  presenting_complaint: Severe pallor, jaundice, and dark urine
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with known G6PD deficiency contracted Hepatitis A during a community outbreak. The viral infection triggered a severe haemolytic crisis, with haemoglobin dropping to 62 g/L and LDH rising to 1500 U/L. He required a blood transfusion and intensive hydration alongside standard hepatitis management.

acute_hepatitis_a_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis A (Atypical Presentation)
  presenting_complaint: Polyarthritis and evanescent rash
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female presented with symmetrical joint pain and a transient maculopapular rash, initially suspected to be Rheumatoid Arthritis. Onset of jaundice four days later prompted LFTs (ALT 1800 U/L) and HAV serology, which was positive. The extrahepatic manifestations resolved as the icteric phase of Hepatitis A progressed.

acute_hepatitis_a_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (Hepatitis A)
  presenting_complaint: Ascites and worsening confusion
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with compensated alcoholic cirrhosis developed acute HAV infection after consuming contaminated shellfish. This triggered rapid decompensation with new-onset ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. He was managed with diuretics and lactulose, requiring a prolonged hospital stay to stabilise his chronic liver disease.

acute_hepatitis_a_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis A (Elderly Patient)
  presenting_complaint: Profound fatigue and weight loss
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female presented with non-specific decline and anorexia, initially raising concerns for occult malignancy. Deranged LFTs led to viral screening, confirming acute HAV. Due to her age and comorbidities (T2DM, CCF), she required inpatient support for nutritional intake and monitoring of fluid balance until her LFTs improved.

acute_hepatitis_a_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis A with Pancreatitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe epigastric pain radiating to the back
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old male presented with clinical features of acute pancreatitis, with an amylase of 1100 U/L. Concomitant jaundice and an ALT of 3000 U/L led to the diagnosis of HAV-induced acute pancreatitis. He was managed conservatively with IV fluids and analgesia, with both the hepatitis and pancreatitis resolving concurrently.

acute_hepatitis_a_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis A (Anicteric)
  presenting_complaint: Flu-like symptoms and mild abdominal discomfort
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old child was screened during a nursery outbreak of Hepatitis A. Although the child never developed jaundice, blood tests revealed an ALT of 150 U/L and positive HAV IgM. The case highlights the common anicteric presentation in paediatrics, which contributes to silent transmission in community settings.

acute_hepatitis_a_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis A (MSM Transmission)
  presenting_complaint: Proctitis and jaundice
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male presented with rectal pain and discharge followed by the onset of icterus. Screening for STIs was performed alongside viral hepatitis serology, confirming acute HAV infection likely transmitted via the faecal-oral route during sexual contact. Public health notification and contact tracing were initiated.

acute_hepatitis_a_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis A (Immunocompromised)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent nausea and low-grade fever
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male on mycophenolate mofetil following a renal transplant presented with prolonged constitutional symptoms. HAV IgM was positive, but he demonstrated delayed viral clearance with detectable HAV RNA in the blood for over three months. Immunosuppression was temporarily reduced under specialist guidance to facilitate viral clearance.

acute_hepatitis_a_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis A (Diagnostic Challenge)
  presenting_complaint: Fever and RUQ pain mimicking cholecystitis
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male presented with fever, Murphy's sign, and raised inflammatory markers, suggesting acute cholecystitis. Ultrasound showed a thickened gallbladder wall but no stones, and LFTs showed a hepatitis pattern (ALT 1200 U/L). Viral serology confirmed HAV, and the gallbladder thickening was identified as an inflammatory response to acute hepatitis rather than primary gallbladder disease.

acute_hepatitis_a_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis A with Aplastic Anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Easy bruising and epistaxis
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male developed severe pancytopenia three weeks after recovering from a documented episode of acute Hepatitis A. Bone marrow biopsy confirmed aplastic anaemia, a rare but recognised post-hepatitic complication. He required treatment with antithymocyte globulin and ciclosporin to manage the haematological failure.

acute_hepatitis_a_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis A (Vaccine Escape/Failure)
  presenting_complaint: Dark urine and malaise
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male who had received a single dose of HAV vaccine ten years prior presented with symptomatic hepatitis. Serology confirmed acute infection, suggesting waning immunity or incomplete primary vaccination series. His course was moderately severe but did not require hospitalisation.

acute_hepatitis_a_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis A with Guillain-Barré Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Ascending weakness following a diarrhoeal illness
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old female developed progressive lower limb weakness and areflexia ten days after the onset of jaundice. Nerve conduction studies confirmed GBS, and HAV IgM was positive. She was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for GBS while her liver function was monitored, eventually regaining full mobility.

acute_hepatitis_a_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis A (Severe Cholestatic)
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male presented with a bilirubin of 500 µmol/L and significant weight loss, initially suspicious for pancreatic head malignancy. CT imaging was unremarkable, but HAV IgM was strongly positive. The patient required admission for nutritional support and management of severe pruritus, with jaundice taking four months to fully resolve.
