megacolon_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Hirschsprung's disease
  presenting_complaint: Failure to pass meconium within 48 hours and abdominal distension.
  summary_of_course: A full-term male neonate presented with bilious vomiting and a tense abdomen. Abdominal X-ray (AXR) showed dilated small bowel loops and a lack of air in the rectum; a contrast enema suggested a transition zone in the rectosigmoid. Rectal suction biopsy confirmed aganglionosis, and the infant underwent a levelled pull-through procedure after initial stabilisation with rectal washouts.

megacolon_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Toxic megacolon secondary to Ulcerative Colitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and fever.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female with known Ulcerative Colitis presented with a five-day history of worsening bloody stools and systemic toxicity. Clinical examination revealed tachycardia (120 bpm) and rebound tenderness, with AXR showing a transverse colon diameter of 8.5cm and loss of haustration. Despite aggressive intravenous corticosteroids and ciclosporin, her condition deteriorated, requiring an emergency subtotal colectomy and end ileostomy.

megacolon_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic idiopathic megacolon
  presenting_complaint: Lifelong refractory constipation and progressive abdominal bloating.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male presented to the outpatient gastroenterology clinic with symptoms worsening over ten years. Investigations including colonic transit studies and anorectal manometry excluded Hirschsprung's and pelvic floor dyssynergia, while CT showed a massively dilated colon (12cm) filled with faecaloma. He was managed with a high-volume polyethylene glycol regimen and regular phosphate enemas, showing moderate symptomatic improvement.

megacolon_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Acute abdominal distension and shortness of breath following hip arthroplasty.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female developed significant abdominal girth increase three days post-orthopaedic surgery. AXR revealed massive dilatation of the caecum (11cm) and ascending colon without mechanical obstruction on CT. After failing conservative management with nasogastric decompression, she successfully underwent endoscopic colonic decompression and was started on neostigmine under cardiac monitoring.

megacolon_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Toxic megacolon secondary to Clostridioides difficile infection
  presenting_complaint: Profuse watery diarrhoea, rigors, and acute confusion.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male, recently treated with clindamycin for cellulitis, presented with signs of septic shock. Laboratory tests showed a white cell count of 35 x 10^9/L and lactate of 4.2 mmol/L, with CT demonstrating a dilated colon of 9cm and significant wall thickening. He was admitted to ICU for vancomycin via nasogastric tube and rectal catheter, alongside intravenous metronidazole, avoiding surgery as the colon diameter reduced over 72 hours.

megacolon_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Adult-onset Hirschsprung's disease
  presenting_complaint: Chronic constipation since childhood and recent faecal impaction.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male presented with a two-week history of absolute constipation and overflow incontinence. History revealed a lifelong reliance on stimulant laxatives and manual evacuation. Full-thickness rectal biopsy under general anaesthetic confirmed a short-segment aganglionosis, and he subsequently underwent a Duhamel procedure with excellent functional recovery.

megacolon_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Parkinson's disease-associated megacolon
  presenting_complaint: Subacute abdominal pain and inability to pass flatus.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with advanced Parkinson's disease and chronic opioid use for back pain presented with a distended, non-tender abdomen. Imaging confirmed generalised colonic dilatation (megacolon) likely due to autonomic dysfunction and medication side effects. Management involved optimising dopaminergic therapy, introducing prucalopride, and aggressive bowel irrigation, which prevented the need for surgical intervention.

megacolon_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Clozapine-induced megacolon
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal distension and reduced appetite in a psychiatric inpatient.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male on high-dose clozapine for treatment-resistant schizophrenia was noted by nursing staff to have a silent, distended abdomen. AXR showed a 10cm dilated sigmoid colon with significant faecal loading; the patient was asymptomatic apart from mild nausea. Clozapine was temporarily withheld, and the megacolon was managed with stimulant laxatives and manual evacuation under sedation.

megacolon_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Chagasic megacolon
  presenting_complaint: Progressive constipation and weight loss over two years.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male who emigrated from Bolivia 20 years ago presented with severe colonic inertia. Serology was positive for Trypanosoma cruzi, and a barium enema showed a classic "megasigmoid" appearance. Due to the severity of the dilatation and recurrent volvulus risk, he underwent a sigmoid colectomy with primary anastomosis.

megacolon_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic megacolon with sigmoid volvulus
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of severe central abdominal pain and vomiting.
  summary_of_course: A 90-year-old resident of a nursing home with known chronic megacolon presented with acute distress. AXR showed a "coffee bean" sign indicative of sigmoid volvulus on a background of a pre-existing 12cm dilated colon. Successful flatus tube decompression was performed, but due to his frailty and the high risk of recurrence, he was managed conservatively with a regular bowel regime.

megacolon_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Megacolon secondary to systemic sclerosis (Scleroderma)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic bloating, early satiety, and alternating bowel habits.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female with known systemic sclerosis presented with worsening gastrointestinal symptoms. CT imaging showed significant dilatation of both the small and large bowel (megacolon and pseudo-obstruction). Management focused on prokinetic agents and nutritional support, as the underlying smooth muscle atrophy and fibrosis made surgical options limited and high-risk.

megacolon_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Toxic megacolon secondary to Crohn's colitis
  presenting_complaint: Fever, abdominal cramps, and tenesmus.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male with a new diagnosis of Crohn's disease presented with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). AXR revealed a dilated transverse colon of 7cm with "mucosal islands" (pseudopolyps). He responded well to intensive intravenous hydrocortisone and infliximab rescue therapy, with serial X-rays showing gradual reduction in colonic calibre over seven days.

megacolon_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Neurogenic megacolon secondary to spinal cord injury
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent autonomic dysreflexia and difficult bowel clearance.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male with a T6 complete spinal cord injury presented with hypertensive crises triggered by bowel distension. Investigations confirmed a neurogenic megacolon with a 9cm descending colon. He was transitioned to a transanal irrigation system (Peristeen), which significantly improved his bowel management and resolved the episodes of autonomic dysreflexia.

megacolon_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Megacolon with spontaneous perforation
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, generalised abdominal pain and collapse.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old female with a history of chronic laxative abuse presented in extremis with a rigid abdomen. Erect chest X-ray showed free air under the diaphragm, and emergency laparotomy revealed a perforated, paper-thin sigmoid colon measuring 14cm in diameter. A Hartmann's procedure was performed, and she required a prolonged ICU stay for faecal peritonitis and multi-organ failure.

megacolon_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Megacolon secondary to diabetic autonomic neuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Chronic nausea, vomiting, and infrequent bowel movements.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with poorly controlled Type 1 diabetes and gastroparesis was found to have generalized colonic dilatation on CT. Anorectal manometry showed a blunted rectoanal inhibitory reflex, but biopsy was negative for Hirschsprung's. He was managed with strict glycaemic control, prokinetics, and a low-residue diet to manage his enteric neuropathy.

megacolon_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic megarectum and megacolon
  presenting_complaint: Severe rectal pressure and faecal impaction.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy presented with a history of encopresis and a palpable abdominal mass. Examination under anaesthesia revealed a massive rectal shelf and a dilated colon extending to the splenic flexure. He was managed with a staged approach involving manual disimpaction followed by a long-term maintenance programme of osmotic laxatives and behavioural therapy.

megacolon_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Megacolon secondary to severe hypothyroidism (Myxoedema)
  presenting_complaint: Lethargy, cold intolerance, and absolute constipation.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old female presented with a three-week history of no bowel movement and profound bradycardia. Laboratory tests showed a TSH of 110 mIU/L and undetectable free T4, while AXR showed significant colonic distension (8cm). The megacolon resolved completely with cautious levothyroxine replacement and temporary use of stimulant laxatives.

megacolon_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Amyloidosis-associated megacolon
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss, macroglossia, and progressive constipation.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with known AL amyloidosis developed symptoms of intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Imaging showed a dilated colon with thickened walls, and rectal biopsy confirmed Congo red-positive deposits in the submucosal vessels. Management was palliative, focusing on symptom control and prokinetic agents, as the underlying systemic disease was advanced.

megacolon_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Megacolon secondary to chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of abdominal distension and vomiting since infancy.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old girl with a history of multiple laparotomies for suspected obstruction was diagnosed with CIPO. Manometry showed discoordinated colonic contractions, and imaging showed persistent megacolon. She required long-term parenteral nutrition and a venting caecostomy to manage the recurrent distension and prevent bacterial overgrowth.

megacolon_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-infectious megacolon (Salmonella enteritidis)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent abdominal bloating and constipation following a severe bout of food poisoning.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old female developed chronic colonic dilatation after a hospitalised episode of salmonellosis six months prior. Investigations showed a dilated descending colon (7.5cm) and delayed transit, suggesting post-infectious damage to the myenteric plexus. She was successfully managed with a combination of linaclotide and dietary modifications over the subsequent year.
