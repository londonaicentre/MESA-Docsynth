macular_degeneration_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Early dry age-related macular degeneration
  presenting_complaint: Mild blurring of central vision and difficulty reading in low light.
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old male smoker presented to his optometrist with gradual visual decline over 12 months. Fundoscopy revealed multiple small hard drusen and focal pigmentary changes in the macula. He was advised on smoking cessation, started on AREDS2 formulation supplements, and scheduled for six-monthly community monitoring.

macular_degeneration_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of distorted vision (metamorphopsia) in the right eye.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old female reported straight lines appearing wavy while reading. Urgent OCT imaging at the eye clinic confirmed subretinal fluid and a choroidal neovascular membrane. She commenced a loading phase of intravitreal aflibercept injections, resulting in significant resolution of oedema and improved visual acuity.

macular_degeneration_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Geographic atrophy secondary to dry AMD
  presenting_complaint: Progressive loss of central vision and large "blank spots" when looking at faces.
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old female with long-standing dry AMD presented with severe bilateral central scotomas. Fundus autofluorescence showed extensive areas of RPE atrophy in both maculae. As no curative treatment is currently available on the NHS for GA, she was referred to the low vision clinic for magnifying aids and social support.

macular_degeneration_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Stargardt disease (Juvenile macular degeneration)
  presenting_complaint: Gradual bilateral reduction in visual acuity and difficulty seeing at school.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old male was referred by school screening with 6/24 vision bilaterally. Genetic testing confirmed ABCA4 mutations, and imaging showed characteristic "pisciform" flecks and macular atrophy. He was provided with an Education, Health and Care (EHC) plan and genetic counselling for his family.

macular_degeneration_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Myopic macular degeneration with CNV
  presenting_complaint: Acute central blurring in a patient with severe short-sightedness.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female with high myopia (-10.0D) presented with a new central scotoma in her left eye. Fluorescein angiography identified a myopic choroidal neovascular membrane (CNV) associated with lacquer cracks. She responded well to a single intravitreal ranibizumab injection, with vision returning to her baseline.

macular_degeneration_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Wet AMD with massive subretinal haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, profound loss of vision in the left eye.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male on warfarin for atrial fibrillation developed a large submacular haemorrhage. Visual acuity dropped to "perception of light" within hours. He underwent emergency pars plana vitrectomy with subretinal tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and gas tamponade to displace the blood, followed by anti-VEGF therapy.

macular_degeneration_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of blurred vision and orange-red nodules on fundoscopy.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male of East Asian descent presented with persistent serosanguinous maculopathy. Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) confirmed polypoidal lesions characteristic of PCV. He was treated with a combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and intravitreal aflibercept, achieving stabilisation of his vision.

macular_degeneration_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Dry AMD with Charles Bonnet Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Complex visual hallucinations of "small people and patterns" in the room.
  summary_of_course: An 89-year-old female with advanced bilateral dry AMD and poor acuity (6/60) reported seeing vivid, non-threatening figures. After excluding cognitive impairment and psychosis, she was diagnosed with Charles Bonnet Syndrome. Reassurance and improved ambient lighting helped reduce the frequency of the hallucinations.

macular_degeneration_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory neovascular age-related macular degeneration
  presenting_complaint: Persistent visual blurring despite monthly eye injections.
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old male showed minimal response to a 12-month course of ranibizumab, with persistent intraretinal fluid on OCT. He was switched to brolucizumab on a "treat-and-extend" protocol. While fluid resolved, he required close monitoring for potential intraocular inflammation, a known side effect of the newer agent.

macular_degeneration_010:
  primary_diagnosis: End-stage bilateral macular degeneration
  presenting_complaint: Total inability to read, drive, or recognise faces; frequent falls.
  summary_of_course: A 92-year-old nursing home resident with bilateral disciform scars was referred following a fall. Assessment confirmed she met the criteria for "Severely Sight Impaired" (blind) registration. Management focused on home safety, mobility training with a white cane, and optimizing her remaining peripheral vision.

macular_degeneration_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Intermediate dry age-related macular degeneration
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic; detected during routine NHS sight test.
  summary_of_course: A 71-year-old female was found to have large soft drusen (>125 microns) in both eyes during a routine check-up. She was asymptomatic with 6/6 vision but had a high risk of progression to wet AMD. She was issued an Amsler grid for home monitoring and advised on a Mediterranean-style diet.

macular_degeneration_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Wet AMD with concurrent Primary Open Angle Glaucoma
  presenting_complaint: Gradual peripheral loss and acute central distortion.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male already using latanoprost for glaucoma developed sudden metamorphopsia. OCT confirmed active CNV, necessitating urgent anti-VEGF injections. Management was complicated by the need to monitor intraocular pressure spikes following intravitreal injections in an already compromised optic nerve.

macular_degeneration_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-injection endophthalmitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe eye pain, redness, and rapid vision loss 48 hours after an AMD injection.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old female presented to the eye casualty with a hypopyon and vitreous haze following her fourth aflibercept dose. She was diagnosed with acute endophthalmitis and underwent immediate vitreous tap and inject of vancomycin and ceftazidime. Her vision partially recovered but remained significantly impaired due to retinal scarring.

macular_degeneration_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Best vitelliform macular dystrophy
  presenting_complaint: Mild central blurring; "egg-yolk" appearance noted on fundoscopy.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male was referred after an optician noted bilateral yellow subfoveal lesions. Electro-oculogram (EOG) showed a reduced Arden ratio, confirming Best disease. He remained stable with 6/9 vision, and his younger siblings were offered screening for the VMD2 gene mutation.

macular_degeneration_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Wet AMD in a patient with advanced Alzheimer's disease
  presenting_complaint: Agitation and worsening disorientation, suspected to be due to vision loss.
  summary_of_course: An 84-year-old male with severe dementia was noted by carers to be bumping into furniture. Examination revealed active wet AMD in his "better" eye, but the patient was unable to tolerate the slit-lamp or injections. Following a best-interests meeting with his family, conservative management with low vision support was chosen over invasive treatment.

macular_degeneration_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Retinal Angiomatous Proliferation (Type 3 CNV)
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive central vision loss and small intraretinal haemorrhages.
  summary_of_course: An 81-year-old female presented with a focal area of intraretinal oedema and a small "cherry-red" spot. Multimodal imaging confirmed Type 3 neovascularization (RAP lesion). She required an intensive monthly anti-VEGF regimen to control the high risk of pigment epithelial detachment and rapid progression to atrophy.

macular_degeneration_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Disciform scar secondary to untreated wet AMD
  presenting_complaint: Permanent central "black hole" in the vision of the right eye.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male who had declined treatment for wet AMD two years prior presented with a stable, dense central scotoma. Fundoscopy showed a large, white subretinal fibrotic scar. As the lesion was inactive and fibrotic, no further anti-VEGF therapy was indicated, and focus shifted to protecting the fellow eye.

macular_degeneration_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Hydroxychloroquine-induced maculopathy (AMD mimic)
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty reading and subtle "shimmering" in the central vision.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female on long-term hydroxychloroquine for rheumatoid arthritis was referred for "atypical AMD". OCT and 10-2 visual fields revealed a classic "bull's eye" maculopathy with parafoveal RPE loss. The medication was ceased in consultation with her rheumatologist to prevent further irreversible retinal toxicity.

macular_degeneration_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Wet AMD with Serous Pigment Epithelial Detachment (PED)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent blurriness and a "hazy" patch in the centre of vision.
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old male presented with a large serous PED on OCT, associated with underlying CNV. Despite multiple injections, the PED remained "tense" with fluctuating subretinal fluid. He was maintained on a strict four-weekly injection schedule to prevent a RPE tear, a known complication of large PEDs.

macular_degeneration_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Early dry AMD with symptomatic Cataract
  presenting_complaint: Increasing glare and difficulty driving at night.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female with known mild dry AMD (drusen) developed significant nuclear sclerotic cataracts. There was clinical concern that cataract surgery might accelerate her AMD progression. Following a detailed risk-benefit discussion, she underwent successful phacoemulsification, which improved her glare symptoms despite her underlying macular changes.
