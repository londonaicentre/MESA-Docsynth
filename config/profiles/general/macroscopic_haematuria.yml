  presenting_complaint: Left flank pain, palpable mass, and macroscopic haematuria
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female presented with the classic triad of flank pain, a palpable mass, and intermittent gross haematuria. A CT urogram showed a 7cm vascular mass in the lower pole of the left kidney. She underwent a successful radical nephrectomy, and histology confirmed clear cell renal cell carcinoma, pT3a.

macroscopic_haematuria_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Radiation Cystitis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic, recurrent macroscopic haematuria and pelvic pain
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female with a history of pelvic radiotherapy for cervical cancer five years prior presented with persistent haematuria. Cystoscopy showed friable, telangiectatic bladder mucosa consistent with late-onset radiation cystitis. She was treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy after failing intravesical alum instillations, leading to significant symptomatic improvement.

macroscopic_haematuria_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Wilms' Tumour
  presenting_complaint: Painless haematuria and abdominal distension in a toddler
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old girl was brought to the paediatrician after her mother noticed blood in her nappy and a firm lump in her abdomen. Ultrasound and CT imaging confirmed a large intra-abdominal mass arising from the right kidney.
