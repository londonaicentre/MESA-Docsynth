CT thorax showed no major vascular injury; managed supportively with oxygen and elevation of the head, with gradual resolution of symptoms over two weeks.

trauma_injury_to_thorax_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Sucking chest wound (Open pneumothorax)
  presenting_complaint: Visible bubbling chest wound and respiratory distress following an industrial explosion.
  summary_of_course: 44-year-old male sustained a large-bore penetrating injury to the lateral chest wall. A three-sided occlusive dressing was applied pre-hospital to create a flutter-valve effect. In hospital, a formal chest drain was inserted away from the wound site, followed by surgical debridement and closure of the chest wall defect.

  primary_diagnosis: Traumatic chylothorax
  presenting_complaint: Progressive dyspnoea two weeks after a severe thoracic spine injury.
  summary_of_course: 50-year-old male with a T6 vertebral fracture developed a large milky pleural effusion. Pleural fluid analysis showed high triglyceride levels, confirming a thoracic duct injury. Initially managed with a low-fat medium-chain triglyceride diet and octreotide; eventually required pleurodesis due to persistent drainage.
