pemphigoid_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Bullous pemphigoid
  presenting_complaint: Tense blisters and intense pruritus on the limbs and trunk.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male presented with a two-week history of widespread tense bullae on an erythematous base. Skin biopsy confirmed subepidermal cleavage and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) showed linear IgG and C3 deposits at the basement membrane zone. He was started on oral Prednisolone 0.5mg/kg and topical Clobetasol propionate, resulting in complete resolution within six weeks.

pemphigoid_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Mucous membrane pemphigoid (ocular)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent bilateral eye redness, grittiness, and blurred vision.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female was referred from ophthalmology with progressive symblepharon and subconjunctival fibrosis. Conjunctival biopsy confirmed cicatricial pemphigoid with linear BMZ deposits. Despite topical steroids, she required systemic immunosuppression with Mycophenolate mofetil and intravenous Cyclophosphamide to prevent further scarring and sight loss.

pemphigoid_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Pemphigoid gestationis
  presenting_complaint: Extremely itchy periumbilical papules and vesicles during the third trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant woman (G2P1) at 34 weeks gestation developed an urticarial rash that rapidly progressed to vesicles involving the umbilicus. Serum BP180 antibodies were significantly elevated. She was managed with high-potency topical steroids and a short course of oral Prednisolone, with symptoms resolving three weeks postpartum.

pemphigoid_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric bullous pemphigoid
  presenting_complaint: Large blisters on the palms and soles of an infant.
  summary_of_course: An 11-month-old male presented with acute onset of acral bullae and erosions. Histopathology and DIF were consistent with BP, an unusual finding in this age group. He responded rapidly to a tapering course of oral Prednisolone and Erythromycin, remaining in remission at 12 months follow-up.

pemphigoid_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Drug-induced bullous pemphigoid
  presenting_complaint: Mild blistering rash on the trunk and upper arms.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male with type 2 diabetes developed a pruritic bullous eruption six months after starting Linagliptin (a DPP-4 inhibitor). The diagnosis of drug-induced BP was made based on clinical timing and biopsy. The offending medication was ceased, and the rash cleared within four weeks using only topical Mometasone furoate.

pemphigoid_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Bullous pemphigoid with secondary sepsis
  presenting_complaint: Ruptured blisters with purulent discharge, fever, and lethargy.
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old female with severe BP presented acutely unwell with signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Wound swabs and blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus, necessitating IV Flucloxacillin and admission to the high dependency unit. Once the infection was controlled, her BP was managed with IV Immunoglobulin (IVIG) due to contraindications for high-dose steroids.

pemphigoid_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Non-bullous pemphigoid
  presenting_complaint: Intractable generalised pruritus and eczematous plaques without blisters.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male suffered from "senile pruritus" for 18 months that was refractory to emollients. Serum ELISA revealed high titres of anti-BP180 antibodies, and a salt-split skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of non-bullous BP. He achieved symptomatic relief with Methotrexate 10mg weekly and potent topical steroids.

pemphigoid_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Localised bullous pemphigoid
  presenting_complaint: Chronic, recurrent blisters limited to the pretibial region.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female presented with a localized eruption on her lower legs, initially misdiagnosed as infected stasis dermatitis. Biopsy of a fresh vesicle showed subepidermal blistering with eosinophils, and DIF was positive for linear IgG. The condition remained localised to the shins and was successfully managed with long-term topical Clobetasol.

pemphigoid_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Mucous membrane pemphigoid (oral)
  presenting_complaint: Painful, bleeding gums and erosions on the hard palate.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female presented with desquamative gingivitis that made eating difficult. Oral biopsy and DIF confirmed MMP. She was treated with a combination of topical steroid mouthwashes and systemic Doxycycline 100mg BD for its anti-inflammatory properties, leading to significant improvement in mucosal integrity.

pemphigoid_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Bullous pemphigoid in dementia
  presenting_complaint: Multiple excoriations and blisters in a nursing home resident.
  summary_of_course: A 90-year-old female with advanced Alzheimer's disease developed BP, complicating her care due to frequent scratching and removal of dressings. Because of the risk of steroid-induced psychosis and agitation, she was managed with a steroid-sparing regimen of Azathioprine and low-dose Prednisolone, requiring close haematological monitoring.

pemphigoid_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic bullous pemphigoid flare
  presenting_complaint: Sudden explosion of new blisters following a steroid taper.
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old male, previously stable on 5mg Prednisolone, experienced a severe relapse when the dose was reduced to 2.5mg. He presented with over 50 new bullae and extensive erosions. He was re-stabilised with a higher steroid dose and the addition of Rituximab infusions, which allowed for a more successful subsequent taper.

pemphigoid_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Bullous pemphigoid associated with Parkinson's disease
  presenting_complaint: Pruritic rash and blisters in a patient with known neurological disease.
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old male with a 5-year history of Parkinson's disease developed BP. Clinical literature suggests a link between the BP180 antigen and neuronal proteins. His skin condition was moderately severe and required a combination of oral Prednisolone and Dapsone, though the latter was stopped due to drug-induced haemolytic anaemia.

pemphigoid_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening bullous pemphigoid
  presenting_complaint: Extensive skin loss (60% BSA) and severe electrolyte imbalance.
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old male was admitted to the burns unit with extensive denuded skin resembling toxic epidermal necrolysis, but biopsy confirmed BP. He required intensive fluid resuscitation, albumin replacement, and Ciclosporin to arrest the disease progression. After a prolonged hospital stay, he was discharged to a rehabilitation facility.

pemphigoid_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Postpartum pemphigoid gestationis flare
  presenting_complaint: Severe exacerbation of blistering 48 hours after delivery.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female who had mild symptoms during pregnancy suffered a massive flare immediately after giving birth. She developed widespread bullae and intense pruritus. High-dose oral Prednisolone (60mg) was initiated, and she was counselled regarding the high risk of recurrence in future pregnancies and with oral contraceptive use.

pemphigoid_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Brunsting-Perry cicatricial pemphigoid
  presenting_complaint: Scarring alopecia and recurrent blisters on the scalp and neck.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male presented with localised blistering on the head and neck that resulted in significant scarring and permanent hair loss. Notably, there was no mucosal involvement. Biopsy showed subepidermal blistering with dermal fibrosis, and he was started on Mycophenolate mofetil to prevent further cicatrisation.

pemphigoid_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Bullous pemphigoid with comorbid heart failure
  presenting_complaint: Blistering rash in a patient unable to tolerate systemic steroids.
  summary_of_course: An 81-year-old female with NYHA Class III heart failure developed BP. Oral Prednisolone was contraindicated due to the risk of fluid retention and exacerbation of heart failure. She was successfully managed with a combination of Nicotinamide and Doxycycline, supplemented by localized Clobetasol for breakthrough blisters.

pemphigoid_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory bullous pemphigoid
  presenting_complaint: Persistent blistering despite multiple immunosuppressive therapies.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female failed to achieve remission on Prednisolone, Azathioprine, and Mycophenolate. She continued to develop new blisters daily. After multidisciplinary review, she was started on Omalizumab (anti-IgE therapy) as an off-label treatment, which finally resulted in disease stabilisation and skin healing.

pemphigoid_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Atypical bullous pemphigoid in a young adult
  presenting_complaint: Vesiculopustular rash on the trunk and limbs of a 24-year-old.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male presented with an unusual presentation of small vesicles and pustules. Initial differentials included dermatitis herpetiformis and linear IgA disease. However, DIF showed linear IgG/C3 and IIF on salt-split skin showed roof-side staining, confirming BP. He responded well to Dapsone and topical steroids.

pemphigoid_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Dyshidrosiform bullous pemphigoid
  presenting_complaint: Large, deep-seated blisters on the palms and soles.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female presented with what appeared to be severe pompholyx eczema. However, the lack of response to standard treatments prompted a biopsy, which revealed a subepidermal split and positive DIF. This rare dyshidrosiform variant of BP was managed with oral Methotrexate, leading to a slow but steady resolution.

pemphigoid_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Paraneoplastic bullous pemphigoid
  presenting_complaint: New onset of blistering rash associated with weight loss and cough.
  summary_of_course: A 76-year-old male smoker presented with BP and constitutional symptoms. Given the atypical presentation and age, a malignancy screen was performed. CT of the chest revealed a suspicious mass, and biopsy confirmed small cell lung carcinoma. His BP was particularly difficult to control until chemotherapy for the underlying malignancy was initiated.
