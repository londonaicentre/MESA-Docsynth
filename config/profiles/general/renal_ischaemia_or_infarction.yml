  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic acute renal infarction
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of right flank pain and nausea
  summary_of_course: A 51-year-old healthy female presented with symptoms mimicking renal colic, but a non-contrast CT was negative for calculi. A subsequent contrast-enhanced CT demonstrated a segmental infarction of the upper pole of the right kidney. Extensive workup for embolic sources and thrombophilia was negative, and she was discharged on long-term aspirin.

renal_ischaemia_or_infarction_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic ischaemic nephropathy due to bilateral renal artery stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Progressive chronic kidney disease and flash pulmonary oedema
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with widespread atherosclerosis presented with recurrent episodes of acute heart failure and a creatinine of 280 µmol/L. Renal artery Doppler and subsequent MRA confirmed >80% bilateral renal artery stenosis. Despite medical optimisation, he required renal artery stenting to control his blood pressure and stabilise his declining renal function.

renal_ischaemia_or_infarction_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Renal infarction in Antiphospholipid Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Left-sided pleuritic chest pain and loin pain
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old woman with a history of three first-trimester miscarriages presented with simultaneous pulmonary embolism and left renal infarction.

  primary_diagnosis: Renal artery thrombosis in Factor V Leiden
  presenting_complaint: Acute abdominal pain and history of deep vein thrombosis
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old female with a known Factor V Leiden mutation presented with acute-onset epigastric and left-sided pain. CT abdomen confirmed a thrombus in the left renal artery with nearly total infarction of the kidney. She was treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis and long-term anticoagulation, though she developed significant permanent cortical thinning of the affected kidney.

renal_ischaemia_or_infarction_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-operative low-flow renal ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Rising creatinine and low urine output following cardiac surgery
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old male underwent complex triple-vessel CABG and aortic valve replacement. His post-operative course was complicated by low cardiac output syndrome and prolonged vasopressor support, leading to global renal ischaemia. His renal function slowly improved over three weeks with inotropic support and careful fluid management, avoiding the need for dialysis.
