cervical_disc_disorder_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute C5/6 disc protrusion with radiculopathy
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset neck pain radiating to the right shoulder and lateral arm.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male rugby player presented to his GP with acute-onset "electric shock" sensations following a scrum. Clinical examination revealed weakened right deltoid (Grade 4) and diminished biceps reflex. MRI confirmed a posterolateral C5/6 disc protrusion compressing the C6 nerve root; he was managed conservatively with neuropathic analgesia and physiotherapy, showing 80% resolution at six weeks.

cervical_disc_disorder_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic cervical spondylotic myelopathy
  presenting_complaint: Progressive gait instability and bilateral hand clumsiness.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female with a history of osteoporosis reported a six-month decline in fine motor skills and frequent trips while walking. Physical examination demonstrated hyperreflexia in all four limbs and a positive Hoffmann's sign. MRI showed multi-level disc-osteophyte complexes with significant cord compression and intramedullary signal change at C4-C6, necessitating urgent anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF).

cervical_disc_disorder_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic C6/7 disc herniation
  presenting_complaint: Exacerbation of chronic neck pain with new-onset triceps weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old HGV driver with long-standing mechanical neck pain experienced a sudden "pop" while lifting heavy goods. Examination showed Grade 3 weakness in right elbow extension and an absent triceps reflex. Urgent MRI identified an acute sequestration of the C6/7 disc onto a background of pre-existing stenosis, requiring surgical decompression after failing a trial of nerve root blocks.

cervical_disc_disorder_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-operative retropharyngeal haematoma following ACDF
  presenting_complaint: Acute respiratory distress and neck swelling six hours post-surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male underwent an uneventful C5/6 ACDF for disc-related radiculopathy. In the recovery ward, he developed rapid-onset stridor and a tense neck swelling; he was emergently intubated and returned to theatre for evacuation of a large haematoma. He was stabilised in the ICU and eventually discharged with no neurological deficits but required prolonged speech and language therapy for dysphagia.

cervical_disc_disorder_005:
  primary_diagnosis: C4/5 disc protrusion presenting as atypical chest pain
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent left-sided chest and precordial pain.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female was repeatedly investigated by cardiology for suspected angina, with normal troponins and coronary angiography. Subsequent orthopaedic review noted the pain was exacerbated by neck extension (Spurling's manoeuvre). MRI cervical spine revealed a left-sided C4/5 paracentral disc protrusion irritating the C5 nerve root, and symptoms resolved following a targeted foraminal epidural steroid injection.

cervical_disc_disorder_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Cervical discitis-osteomyelitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe neck pain, pyrexia, and night sweats.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old intravenous drug user presented with subacute, non-mechanical neck pain and a CRP of 145 mg/L. MRI demonstrated loss of C5/6 disc height with endplate destruction and an associated prevertebral phlegmon. Blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus, and he was treated with a six-week course of intravenous flucloxacillin and a rigid neck collar, avoiding the need for stabilising surgery.

cervical_disc_disorder_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Adolescent cervical disc herniation
  presenting_complaint: Persistent torticollis and left arm paraesthesia.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old female gymnast presented with a three-week history of neck stiffness following a fall. Initial radiographs were normal, but persistent neurological symptoms prompted an MRI, which revealed a rare C3/4 disc herniation. Given her age and lack of myelopathy, she was managed with intensive physiotherapy and activity modification, achieving full symptomatic relief within three months.

cervical_disc_disorder_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent C5/6 disc herniation post-microdiscectomy
  presenting_complaint: Return of severe radicular pain after a pain-free interval.
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old male had undergone a successful posterior microdiscectomy for a C5/6 disc protrusion one year prior. He presented with a sudden relapse of right-sided C6 distribution pain after heavy lifting. Repeat MRI confirmed recurrent disc material at the same level; due to the failure of conservative measures and the impact on his livelihood, he underwent a revision ACDF.

cervical_disc_disorder_009:
  primary_diagnosis: C6/7 disc disorder with co-morbid Rheumatoid Arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Neck pain and bilateral hand numbness.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female with long-standing RA presented with worsening cervical symptoms. Imaging showed C6/7 disc degeneration alongside inflammatory pannus at the atlanto-axial joint causing instability. Management was complex, requiring a multidisciplinary approach to address both the degenerative disc disease and the RA-related instability, eventually resulting in a posterior cervical fusion from C2 to T1.

cervical_disc_disorder_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Central cord syndrome secondary to C5/6 disc prolapse
  presenting_complaint: Sudden weakness in hands greater than legs after a minor trip.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male fell forward at home, striking his forehead. He developed immediate "burning" pain and significant weakness in his upper limbs, while maintaining relatively preserved lower limb strength. MRI showed a traumatic C5/6 disc prolapse on a background of congenital stenosis causing cord contusion; he was admitted for high-dose steroids and delayed surgical stabilisation, showing partial motor recovery.

cervical_disc_disorder_011:
  primary_diagnosis: C7/T1 disc herniation (C8 radiculopathy)
  presenting_complaint: Weakness in hand grip and numbness in the little finger.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old office worker reported difficulty using a computer mouse and numbness in the medial aspect of the left hand. Examination confirmed weakness in the intrinsic hand muscles (T1) and flexor digitorum profundus (C8). MRI identified a rare C7/T1 disc protrusion compressing the C8 nerve root; he responded well to a series of transforaminal epidural injections and ergonomic workplace adjustments.

cervical_disc_disorder_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute C2/3 disc protrusion
  presenting_complaint: Severe high neck pain and occipital headache.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female presented with "agonising" pain at the base of the skull and restricted neck rotation. Neurological exam was unremarkable, but MRI revealed a cranially migrated C2/3 disc fragment. Due to the proximity to the brainstem and the severity of pain, she was admitted for inpatient pain management and eventually underwent a successful anterior discectomy.

cervical_disc_disorder_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild cervical discogenic pain
  presenting_complaint: Dull, aching neck pain exacerbated by prolonged sitting.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old software developer presented with chronic postural neck pain but no radicular symptoms. MRI showed mild desiccation of the C4/5 and C5/6 discs without significant herniation or stenosis. She was diagnosed with discogenic pain and successfully managed in the community through a combined programme of Pilates, postural education, and occasional paracetamol.

cervical_disc_disorder_014:
  primary_diagnosis: C5/6 disc protrusion in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Right arm pain and tingling in the third trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old female, 34 weeks pregnant, developed acute C6 radiculopathy. Management was challenging due to limitations on imaging and medication; a non-contrast MRI confirmed a C5/6 disc bulge. She was managed with paracetamol, physiotherapy, and side-sleeping education, with symptoms resolving spontaneously three weeks postpartum.

cervical_disc_disorder_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Brown-Séquard syndrome from cervical disc sequestration
  presenting_complaint: Left-sided weakness and right-sided loss of temperature sensation.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male presented with a dramatic hemicord syndrome. MRI revealed a large, lateralised C5/6 disc sequestration causing significant spinal cord rotation and compression. He underwent emergency posterior decompression and discectomy; while his motor function improved significantly, he retained some permanent sensory deficits in the contralateral limb.

cervical_disc_disorder_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Calcified C5/6 disc protrusion
  presenting_complaint: Chronic, refractory neck and arm pain.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old retired builder had a 10-year history of right-sided C6 radiculopathy that had failed multiple conservative treatments. CT imaging revealed the C5/6 disc fragment was heavily calcified, explaining the lack of response to steroid injections. He underwent an anterior cervical discectomy using a high-speed drill to remove the "hard" disc, resulting in a 50% reduction in his chronic pain scores.

cervical_disc_disorder_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Multi-level cervical disc disease with vertebral artery loops
  presenting_complaint: Neck pain and dizziness on rotation.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male presented with neck pain and episodic vertigo. MRI showed multi-level disc degeneration, but also noted tortuous vertebral arteries causing bony erosion at C5/6. This diagnostic challenge required CT angiography to differentiate between discogenic pain and Bow Hunter’s Syndrome; he was managed conservatively with a soft collar and avoidance of extreme rotation.

cervical_disc_disorder_018:
  primary_diagnosis: C6/7 disc prolapse with severe triceps palsy
  presenting_complaint: Sudden "drop" of the left arm and inability to extend the elbow.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female woke up with a "dead" left arm. Examination revealed Grade 2 power in the triceps and wrist extensors, suggesting a severe C7 motor deficit. MRI confirmed a large C6/7 disc prolapse; due to the profound motor weakness, she was fast-tracked for surgery within 48 hours, regaining Grade 4+ power by her six-month follow-up.

cervical_disc_disorder_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Cervical disc disorder with neuropathic pain syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Burning neck pain and hypersensitivity to touch.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old female with a history of fibromyalgia developed a C5/6 disc bulge. While the disc morphology was mild on MRI, her pain response was disproportionately severe, characterized by allodynia and hyperalgesia. She was managed by the chronic pain team with a combination of Pregabalin, Duloxetine, and cognitive behavioural therapy, as surgical intervention was deemed likely to worsen her centralised pain.

cervical_disc_disorder_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Massive central C4/5 disc herniation with acute quadriparesis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of inability to move all four limbs after sneezing.
  summary_of_course: A 51-year-old male with no prior history experienced a catastrophic disc event while sneezing. He presented to the A&E with Grade 1-2 power in all extremities and a sensory level at C5. Emergency MRI showed a massive central C4/5 disc extrusion; he underwent immediate decompressive laminectomy and remained in the spinal injuries unit for intensive rehabilitation, eventually regaining the ability to ambulate with a frame.
