early_onset_alzheimer_disease_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Early Onset Alzheimer Disease (Amnestic Variant)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive short-term memory loss and disorientation.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male presented to his GP with a two-year history of worsening episodic memory and difficulty navigating familiar routes. Neuropsychological testing revealed significant deficits in delayed recall (ACE-III score 72/100), and an MRI head showed bilateral hippocampal atrophy (Scheltens scale grade 2). He was diagnosed with mild EOAD and commenced on Donepezil 5mg, showing initial stabilisation of symptoms at six-month follow-up.

early_onset_alzheimer_disease_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Logopenic Variant Early Onset Alzheimer Disease
  presenting_complaint: Word-finding difficulties and impaired sentence repetition.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female solicitor reported increasing difficulty finding words during meetings and hesitations in speech. Speech and language assessment confirmed logopenic primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA) characteristics, while a CSF analysis showed a low A-beta-42/40 ratio and elevated Phospho-Tau. She was diagnosed with an atypical presentation of EOAD and referred for specialist speech therapy alongside Galantamine treatment.

early_onset_alzheimer_disease_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) due to EOAD
  presenting_complaint: Blurred vision and difficulty judging distances despite normal ophthalmic exams.
  summary_of_course: A 56-year-old female was referred by an optician after failing to find objects in plain sight and struggling with reading. Clinical examination identified Balint’s syndrome (simultanagnosia and optic ataxia), and an FDG-PET scan revealed significant hypometabolism in the bilateral parieto-occipital regions. She was diagnosed with PCA-variant EOAD and provided with low-vision aids and occupational therapy support.

early_onset_alzheimer_disease_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Frontal Variant Early Onset Alzheimer Disease
  presenting_complaint: Personality changes, disinhibition, and executive dysfunction.
  summary_of_course: A 49-year-old male was initially referred to psychiatry for suspected late-onset bipolar disorder due to impulsive spending and social inappropriateness. Further cognitive testing showed profound executive impairment, and a DaTscan was normal, but an amyloid PET scan was strongly positive. He was diagnosed with frontal variant EOAD and started on Memantine to manage behavioural symptoms.

early_onset_alzheimer_disease_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Early Onset Alzheimer Disease in Down Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Rapid decline in activities of daily living and new-onset seizures.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male with trisomy 21 presented with a subacute loss of dressing and feeding skills. He experienced two generalised tonic-clonic seizures within a month, and an EEG showed diffuse slowing. Given the high genetic risk, he was diagnosed with severe EOAD and managed with Levetiracetam for epilepsy and a multidisciplinary care package in a supported living facility.

early_onset_alzheimer_disease_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Autosomal Dominant Early Onset Alzheimer Disease (PSEN1 mutation)
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive cognitive decline and myoclonus.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old female with a strong family history of young-onset dementia presented with a 12-month history of memory loss and involuntary muscle jerks. Genetic testing confirmed a pathogenic mutation in the Presenilin 1 (PSEN1) gene. Despite aggressive management with Rivastigmine patches, her condition deteriorated rapidly to a severe stage within two years, requiring full-time nursing care.

early_onset_alzheimer_disease_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Early Onset Alzheimer Disease
  presenting_complaint: Aspiration pneumonia and total dependence for care.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with a 10-year history of EOAD was admitted to the acute medical ward with fever and hypoxia secondary to aspiration. He was non-verbal with a GCS of 11 and had significant dysphagia. Following a multidisciplinary review, the goals of care were transitioned to palliation, focusing on comfort and secretion management using hyoscine butylbromide.

early_onset_alzheimer_disease_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic delirium in Early Onset Alzheimer Disease
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of confusion and urinary incontinence.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female with moderate EOAD was brought to A&E with a 48-hour history of increased agitation and visual hallucinations. Urinalysis was positive for nitrites and leucocytes, confirming a urinary tract infection (UTI). She was treated with IV antibiotics and her cognitive status returned to her baseline moderate impairment over seven days.

early_onset_alzheimer_disease_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Early Onset Alzheimer Disease (Diagnostic Challenge)
  presenting_complaint: Treatment-resistant depression and apathy.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male spent two years under community mental health teams for major depressive disorder that failed to respond to multiple SSRIs and SNRIs. A detailed neuropsychiatric review noted subtle deficits in visuospatial memory, and subsequent CSF biomarkers confirmed an underlying AD pathology. The diagnosis was revised to EOAD, and he was commenced on acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with some improvement in engagement.

early_onset_alzheimer_disease_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Early Onset Alzheimer Disease with Secondary Epilepsy
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of loss of consciousness.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with established EOAD presented with three episodes of tonic-clonic activity over six months. MRI showed global atrophy but no focal lesions or hippocampal sclerosis. He was diagnosed with AD-associated epilepsy, a common complication in early-onset cases, and successfully stabilised on Sodium Valproate without significant cognitive side effects.

early_onset_alzheimer_disease_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Early Onset Alzheimer Disease (Occupational Presentation)
  presenting_complaint: Errors in complex work tasks and poor time management.
  summary_of_course: A 46-year-old senior architect was referred by occupational health after making repeated structural calculation errors. Initial screening (GPCOG) was borderline, but a specialist neuropsychological battery revealed significant deficits in executive function and working memory. PET-CT imaging confirmed amyloid deposition, leading to a diagnosis of mild EOAD and early retirement on medical grounds.

early_onset_alzheimer_disease_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Early Onset Alzheimer Disease (Treatment Failure)
  presenting_complaint: Syncope and symptomatic bradycardia.
  summary_of_course: A 53-year-old female with mild EOAD was started on Donepezil 5mg. Two weeks later, she presented to A&E following a syncopal episode; an ECG revealed a heart rate of 42 bpm (sinus bradycardia). The Donepezil was discontinued due to cholinergic side effects on the cardiac conduction system, and she was successfully transitioned to Memantine 10mg daily.

early_onset_alzheimer_disease_013:
  primary_diagnosis: End-stage Early Onset Alzheimer Disease
  presenting_complaint: Refusal to eat and profound weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old female in the terminal stage of EOAD was reviewed by the community palliative care team. She was bedbound, doubly incontinent, and had lost the swallow reflex. Management focused on subcutaneous fluids for hydration and midazolam via a syringe driver to manage terminal agitation, ensuring a dignified death at home.

early_onset_alzheimer_disease_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Mixed Dementia (EOAD and Vascular)
  presenting_complaint: Step-wise decline in cognition and focal weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension and heavy smoking presented with worsening memory loss and a transient ischaemic attack (TIA). MRI showed both hippocampal atrophy and significant periventricular white matter hyperintensities (Fazekas grade 3). He was diagnosed with mixed EOAD and vascular dementia, requiring aggressive blood pressure control alongside Rivastigmine.

early_onset_alzheimer_disease_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Early Onset Alzheimer Disease with Extrapyramidal Features
  presenting_complaint: Cognitive decline and Parkinsonian gait.
  summary_of_course: A 57-year-old female developed progressive memory loss followed by rigidity and a shuffling gait within 18 months. While Lewy Body Dementia was considered, an amyloid PET scan was positive and CSF Tau was markedly elevated. She was diagnosed with EOAD with prominent extrapyramidal signs and managed with a combination of Donepezil and low-dose Madopar for motor symptoms.

early_onset_alzheimer_disease_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Familial Early Onset Alzheimer Disease (APP mutation)
  presenting_complaint: Anxiety and mild forgetfulness in a high-risk individual.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old male, whose father died of EOAD at age 45, requested genetic testing which confirmed an Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) mutation. Although his MMSE was 29/30, sensitive computerised testing showed early deficits in associative memory. He was enrolled in a clinical trial for anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies as part of a pre-symptomatic/early-symptomatic cohort.

early_onset_alzheimer_disease_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Early Onset Alzheimer Disease with Psychosis
  presenting_complaint: Paranoid delusions regarding her spouse.
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old female with moderate EOAD began accusing her husband of being an impostor (Capgras syndrome) and hiding her belongings. These psychotic features caused significant caregiver distress and risk of aggression. After failing to respond to environmental modifications, she was started on low-dose Quetiapine with close monitoring for extrapyramidal side effects and cerebrovascular risk.

early_onset_alzheimer_disease_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-traumatic Early Onset Alzheimer Disease
  presenting_complaint: Accelerated cognitive decline following a head injury.
  summary_of_course: A 51-year-old male with a history of multiple concussions from amateur boxing presented with rapid cognitive failure. While Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) was a differential, CSF biomarkers (p-Tau/A-beta ratio) were highly suggestive of Alzheimer's pathology. It was concluded that his traumatic brain injuries likely lowered the threshold for the clinical expression of EOAD.

early_onset_alzheimer_disease_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Early Onset Alzheimer Disease (High Cognitive Reserve)
  presenting_complaint: Subjective cognitive impairment despite normal screening scores.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old university professor complained of "mental fog" and difficulty multitasking. Initial MoCA was 28/30, but detailed neuro-psychological testing revealed scores below expected for his premorbid IQ in the memory domain. A subsequent 18F-Flutemetamol PET scan showed cortical amyloid deposition, confirming a diagnosis of EOAD despite his high functional baseline.

early_onset_alzheimer_disease_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Rapidly Progressive Early Onset Alzheimer Disease
  presenting_complaint: Profound cognitive collapse over six months.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old female presented with a six-month history of rapidly declining memory, ataxia, and mutism. Initial investigations targeted Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), but 14-3-3 protein was negative and MRI did not show cortical ribboning. CSF analysis eventually showed extremely high Total-Tau (>2000 pg/ml) and low A-beta-42, leading to a diagnosis of an atypically aggressive form of EOAD.
