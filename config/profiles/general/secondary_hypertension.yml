secondary_hypertension_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Atherosclerotic Renal Artery Stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Flash pulmonary oedema and hypertensive urgency
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male with known peripheral vascular disease presented to A&E with acute breathlessness and a BP of 220/115 mmHg. Chest X-ray confirmed pulmonary oedema, and MRA revealed 85% stenosis of the left renal artery. He was stabilised with IV nitrates and later underwent renal artery stenting, resulting in significantly improved BP control on reduced medication.

secondary_hypertension_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary Aldosteronism (Conn's Syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Muscle weakness and resistant hypertension
  summary_of_course: A 46-year-old female with BP 175/105 mmHg despite taking amlodipine and ramipril was found to have persistent hypokalaemia (K+ 2.8 mmol/L). Investigations showed a high aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) and a 1.5cm left-sided adrenal adenoma on CT. Following a laparoscopic left adrenalectomy, her potassium levels normalised and her BP reduced to 130/80 mmHg without antihypertensives.

secondary_hypertension_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Phaeochromocytoma
  presenting_complaint: Paroxysmal palpitations, sweating, and severe headaches
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old male presented with episodic "panic attacks" associated with BP spikes up to 210/120 mmHg. 24-hour urinary fractionated metanephrines were five times the upper limit of normal, and an MRI identified a 4cm vascular mass in the right adrenal gland. He was pre-treated with phenoxybenzamine and propranolol before successful surgical resection.

secondary_hypertension_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Fibromuscular Dysplasia
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of high blood pressure in a young patient
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old female was found to have a BP of 185/110 mmHg during a routine contraceptive pill check. An audible epigastric bruit prompted a renal ultrasound and subsequent CT angiography, which showed a "string of beads" appearance of the right renal artery. She underwent successful percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) with immediate resolution of hypertension.

secondary_hypertension_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Coarctation of the Aorta
  presenting_complaint: Exertional leg pain and headaches
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old boy was referred to paediatrics with a BP of 160/95 mmHg. Physical examination revealed a significant radio-femoral delay and a systolic murmur heard loudest over the back. Echocardiography and CT confirmed a severe post-ductal coarctation, which was treated with surgical end-to-end anastomosis.

secondary_hypertension_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA)
  presenting_complaint: Daytime somnolence and snoring
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old obese male (BMI 38) presented with resistant hypertension (165/100 mmHg) on four agents. Polysomnography confirmed severe OSA with an Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index (AHI) of 45. Initiation of nocturnal CPAP therapy led to a 15 mmHg drop in systolic BP and improved efficacy of his existing medications.

secondary_hypertension_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Cushing's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Weight gain, easy bruising, and proximal muscle weakness
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female presented with new-onset hypertension (170/105 mmHg), moon facies, and purple abdominal striae. Elevated 24-hour urinary free cortisol and a failed low-dose dexamethasone suppression test led to an MRI brain, which identified a pituitary microadenoma. Transsphenoidal resection of the tumour resulted in the gradual resolution of her hypertensive state.

secondary_hypertension_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Kidney Disease (Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease)
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral loin pain and haematuria
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male with a family history of renal failure presented with a BP of 155/100 mmHg. Abdominal palpation revealed bilateral masses, and ultrasound confirmed multiple large cysts in both kidneys with an eGFR of 55 mL/min/1.73m2. BP was managed aggressively with ACE inhibitors to slow the progression of renal decline.

secondary_hypertension_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary Hyperparathyroidism
  presenting_complaint: Polyuria, polydipsia, and constipation
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with mild hypertension (150/90 mmHg) was found to have a corrected calcium of 2.85 mmol/L during routine bloods. Further testing showed an inappropriately elevated PTH and a parathyroid adenoma on a Sestamibi scan. Following parathyroidectomy, her calcium levels normalised and her BP became significantly easier to control with monotherapy.

secondary_hypertension_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Oral Contraceptive Pill-Induced Hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Routine BP monitoring
  summary_of_course: A 23-year-old female with no prior medical history was found to have a BP of 152/96 mmHg three months after starting a combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP). There were no other symptoms or abnormal investigations. Upon cessation of the COCP and switching to a progestogen-only method, her BP returned to 118/76 mmHg within two months.

secondary_hypertension_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acromegaly
  presenting_complaint: Increasing shoe size and carpal tunnel syndrome
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male presented with coarsening facial features and a BP of 175/110 mmHg. Blood tests revealed a significantly elevated IGF-1 level and failure to suppress Growth Hormone during an oral glucose tolerance test. An MRI confirmed a pituitary macroadenoma, and he was started on somatostatin analogues prior to surgery to manage his systemic hypertension.

secondary_hypertension_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Liddle Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Severe hypertension in early childhood
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old girl was found to have a BP of 150/100 mmHg during a school screening. Labs showed hypokalaemia and metabolic alkalosis, but surprisingly low levels of both renin and aldosterone. Genetic testing confirmed a mutation in the SCNN1B gene, and her BP was successfully managed with amiloride, which specifically targets the overactive epithelial sodium channels.

secondary_hypertension_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Takayasu Arteritis
  presenting_complaint: Malaise, night sweats, and absent radial pulses
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female of Asian descent presented with a BP of 180/110 mmHg in her right arm, but unmeasurable BP in the left. CT angiography showed extensive thickening and narrowing of the aortic arch and its branches. She was treated with high-dose corticosteroids and methotrexate to control the vasculitis and secondary renovascular hypertension.

secondary_hypertension_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Hyperthyroidism (Graves' Disease)
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss, tremor, and palpitations
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female presented with a wide pulse pressure (BP 160/65 mmHg) and sinus tachycardia. Thyroid function tests showed a TSH <0.01 mIU/L and elevated Free T4. Treatment with carbimazole and propranolol resolved her thyrotoxicosis and returned her systolic BP to the normal range.

secondary_hypertension_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Pseudo-hyperaldosteronism (Liquorice Ingestion)
  presenting_complaint: Lethargy and very high BP
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male presented with a BP of 190/110 mmHg and profound hypokalaemia (K+ 2.2 mmol/L). Detailed dietary history revealed he had been consuming 200g of natural black liquorice daily for several months. His renin and aldosterone were both suppressed; his BP and electrolytes normalised three weeks after discontinuing liquorice consumption.

secondary_hypertension_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Transplant Renal Artery Stenosis (TRAS)
  presenting_complaint: Rising creatinine and worsening BP post-transplant
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male, six months post-deceased donor renal transplant, developed refractory hypertension (175/105 mmHg) and a 30% increase in serum creatinine. Doppler ultrasound of the graft showed high peak systolic velocities at the anastomosis. Following balloon angioplasty of the transplant artery, renal function stabilised and BP control improved.

secondary_hypertension_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Glucocorticoid-Remediable Aldosteronism (GRA)
  presenting_complaint: Early-onset hypertension with family history of stroke
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male presented with a BP of 185/115 mmHg; his father had suffered a haemorrhagic stroke at age 34. Genetic testing identified the chimeric CYP11B1/CYP11B2 gene. His hypertension, which was resistant to standard diuretics, responded dramatically to low-dose dexamethasone and eplerenone.

secondary_hypertension_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Malignant Hypertension secondary to IgA Nephropathy
  presenting_complaint: Blurred vision and severe headache
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male presented to A&E with a BP of 240/140 mmHg and bilateral papilloedema. Urinalysis showed 3+ protein and macroscopic haematuria, with a serum creatinine of 350 umol/L. A renal biopsy confirmed IgA nephropathy, and he required intensive IV labetalol followed by ACE inhibitors and immunosuppression.

secondary_hypertension_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Drug-Induced Hypertension (NSAID Overuse)
  presenting_complaint: Poor BP control in a patient with osteoarthritis
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female with previously well-controlled hypertension presented with a BP of 170/95 mmHg. She had recently started taking high-dose ibuprofen (400mg TDS) for knee pain. Switching her analgesia to paracetamol and topical NSAIDs resulted in her BP returning to target within two weeks without further medication changes.

secondary_hypertension_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Renovascular Hypertension (Renal Artery Compression by Median Arcuate Ligament)
  presenting_complaint: Post-prandial abdominal pain and hypertension
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented with unexplained hypertension (160/100 mmHg) and weight loss due to fear of eating. Imaging revealed that the median arcuate ligament was compressing not only the coeliac axis but also causing functional narrowing of the renal artery origins during expiration. Surgical release of the ligament resulted in resolution of both the abdominal pain and the hypertension.
