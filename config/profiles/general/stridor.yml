stridor_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Viral Laryngotracheobronchitis (Croup)
  presenting_complaint: Barking cough and inspiratory stridor
  summary_of_course: A 2-year-old male presented to A&E with a 2-day history of coryza followed by a harsh barking cough and mild inspiratory stridor at rest. Observations showed no respiratory distress and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. He was treated with a single dose of oral dexamethasone (0.15mg/kg) and discharged home following a period of observation as the stridor resolved.

stridor_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Epiglottitis
  presenting_complaint: High fever, drooling, and muffled voice
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old female, unimmunised, presented in a tripod position with severe inspiratory stridor, high fever (39.5°C), and significant drooling. She was taken immediately to theatre for controlled intubation by a senior anaesthetist; laryngoscopy revealed a "cherry-red" epiglottis. Following 48 hours of IV ceftriaxone and airway support in PICU, she was successfully extubated.

stridor_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Foreign Body Aspiration
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset choking and persistent stridor
  summary_of_course: An 18-month-old boy was brought to the emergency department after a sudden choking episode while eating peanuts. Examination revealed biphasic stridor and decreased breath sounds on the right side. Rigid bronchoscopy under general anaesthesia confirmed a peanut fragment lodged in the subglottis, which was successfully removed with no long-term sequelae.

stridor_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Bacterial Tracheitis
  presenting_complaint: Toxic appearance, high fever, and severe stridor
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old male initially diagnosed with croup failed to improve with steroids and nebulised adrenaline, developing a high fever and thick purulent secretions. He required urgent intubation due to progressive airway obstruction and "shaggy" tracheal membranes seen on bronchoscopy. He completed a 10-day course of IV co-amoxiclav in the ICU before recovery.

stridor_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Bilateral Vocal Cord Paralysis
  presenting_complaint: Immediate post-operative stridor and respiratory distress
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female underwent a total thyroidectomy for a large multinodular goitre. In the recovery room, she developed immediate, severe inspiratory stridor and hypoxia. Flexible nasendoscopy confirmed bilateral vocal cord paralysis in the paramedian position, necessitating an emergency tracheostomy to secure the airway.

stridor_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Chronic hoarseness and progressive exertional stridor
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male smoker presented with a 6-month history of worsening hoarseness and recent onset of stridor when walking. Laryngoscopy revealed a large, fungating mass involving the true vocal cords with significant glottic narrowing. He was staged as T3N0M0 and underwent a total laryngectomy followed by adjuvant radiotherapy.

stridor_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Anaphylaxis
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset stridor, urticaria, and hypotension
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male presented with rapid-onset swelling of the lips, a widespread urticarial rash, and loud inspiratory stridor after a wasp sting. He was treated immediately with IM adrenaline (1:1000), IV chlorphenamine, and hydrocortisone. His airway symptoms resolved within 30 minutes, and he was admitted for 12 hours of observation for biphasic reactions.

stridor_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Acquired Subglottic Stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent stridor following prolonged intubation
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female, previously intubated for 3 weeks in ICU due to COVID-19 pneumonia, presented 1 month post-discharge with progressive dyspnoea and biphasic stridor. Microlaryngoscopy confirmed Grade III Cotton-Myer subglottic stenosis. She underwent successful endoscopic CO2 laser resection and balloon dilatation.

stridor_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Laryngomalacia
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent inspiratory stridor since birth
  summary_of_course: A 3-month-old infant was referred to the ENT clinic with "noisy breathing" that worsened during feeding and when supine. Clinical examination showed mild inspiratory stridor but normal weight gain and no signs of respiratory distress. Nasendoscopy confirmed omega-shaped epiglottis and arytenoid prolapse, and the parents were reassured as the condition was expected to resolve spontaneously by age 2.

stridor_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Thermal Inhalation Injury
  presenting_complaint: Facial burns, soot in oropharynx, and delayed stridor
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male was rescued from a house fire with significant facial soot and singed nasal hairs. Although initially stable, he developed progressive stridor and hoarseness 4 hours after admission, indicating supraglottic oedema. He was intubated electively to protect the airway and managed in the burns unit with humidified oxygen and weaning.

stridor_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Retropharyngeal Abscess
  presenting_complaint: Sore throat, neck stiffness, and muffled voice
  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old male presented with a 3-day history of fever, refusal to swallow, and a "hot potato" voice. On examination, he had mild inspiratory stridor and limited neck extension. A CT neck with contrast revealed a large fluid collection in the retropharyngeal space, which was surgically drained trans-orally under general anaesthesia.

stridor_012:
  primary_diagnosis: ACE-Inhibitor Induced Angioedema
  presenting_complaint: Sudden tongue swelling and inspiratory stridor
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male on long-term ramipril presented with acute, painless swelling of the tongue and soft palate, progressing to inspiratory stridor. He did not respond to adrenaline or steroids, reflecting the bradykinin-mediated pathway. He required a temporary awake fibreoptic intubation until the angioedema subsided over 48 hours.

stridor_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)
  presenting_complaint: Subacute stridor and crusting nasal discharge
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female presented with a 2-month history of "asthma-like" symptoms and new-onset stridor. Investigations revealed a saddle-nose deformity, haematuria, and a positive c-ANCA. Bronchoscopy showed subglottic inflammation and friable mucosa; she was started on high-dose corticosteroids and rituximab with significant improvement in airway patency.

stridor_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Retrosternal Goitre
  presenting_complaint: Positional stridor and dysphagia
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old female with a known long-standing goitre presented with stridor that occurred only when lying flat. A CT scan showed a large retrosternal extension of the thyroid causing 60% compression of the mid-trachea. She underwent a total thyroidectomy via a cervical approach with sternotomy, resulting in immediate relief of her respiratory symptoms.

stridor_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Paradoxical Vocal Fold Motion (VCD)
  presenting_complaint: Episodic stridor triggered by exercise
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female athlete was repeatedly treated for refractory asthma before being referred for episodic stridor during high-intensity training. Flow-volume loops showed a flattened inspiratory limb during an attack, and laryngoscopy confirmed adduction of the vocal cords during inspiration. She was successfully managed with speech therapy and breathing retraining techniques.

stridor_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Subglottic Haemangioma
  presenting_complaint: Biphasic stridor and cutaneous "strawberry" naevus
  summary_of_course: A 4-month-old female presented with progressively worsening biphasic stridor and a large cutaneous haemangioma on her neck. Endoscopy revealed a reddish, compressible subglottic mass narrowing the airway by 70%. She was treated with oral propranolol (2mg/kg), which led to a dramatic reduction in the size of the lesion and resolution of the stridor over 6 months.

stridor_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Ludwig’s Angina
  presenting_complaint: Submandibular swelling, toothache, and stridor
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male with poor dental hygiene presented with a firm, woody swelling of the floor of the mouth and elevation of the tongue. He developed rapid-onset stridor and drooling due to posterior displacement of the tongue. He underwent emergency awake fibreoptic intubation followed by surgical incision and drainage of the submandibular space.

stridor_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Multiple System Atrophy (Gerhardt’s Syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Nocturnal stridor and parkinsonian features
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with a diagnosis of Multiple System Atrophy was brought in by his wife due to loud, "donkey-like" noises during sleep. A sleep study confirmed nocturnal inspiratory stridor, and laryngoscopy showed abductor vocal cord paralysis. Due to the risk of sudden death, he was managed with nocturnal CPAP and eventually a permanent tracheostomy.

stridor_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Tracheomalacia
  presenting_complaint: Expiratory stridor and recurrent chest infections
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with a history of severe COPD and previous long-term tracheostomy presented with a chronic "honking" cough and expiratory stridor. Dynamic CT and bronchoscopy demonstrated >80% collapse of the tracheal lumen during expiration. He was treated with a silicone tracheal stent, which significantly improved his exercise tolerance and cough.

stridor_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-Extubation Laryngeal Oedema
  presenting_complaint: Stridor 30 minutes after planned extubation
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male was extubated after 7 days of mechanical ventilation for sepsis. Within 30 minutes, he developed loud inspiratory stridor and increased work of breathing. He was treated with nebulised adrenaline (5ml of 1:1000) and IV dexamethasone; his symptoms resolved over 4 hours, avoiding the need for re-intubation.
