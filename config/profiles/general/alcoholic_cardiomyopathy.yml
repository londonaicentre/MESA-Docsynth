alcoholic_cardiomyopathy_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic alcoholic cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Progressive exertional dyspnoea and orthopnoea
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with a 15-year history of consuming 80 units of alcohol per week presented with NYHA Class III heart failure symptoms. Echocardiography revealed a dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 30% and global hypokinesis. Following alcohol cessation and initiation of ramipril and bisoprolol, his symptoms improved significantly over six months with an improved EF of 45%.

alcoholic_cardiomyopathy_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute decompensated alcoholic cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset shortness of breath and frothy sputum
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male was admitted to A&E with acute pulmonary oedema following a week-long heavy drinking binge. Investigations showed severe biventricular failure and a NT-proBNP of 8500 pg/mL. He required IV furosemide and CPAP ventilation in the high dependency unit before transitioning to oral heart failure medications and alcohol withdrawal support.

alcoholic_cardiomyopathy_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic cardiomyopathy with permanent atrial fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations, lethargy, and ankle swelling
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with a long-standing history of hidden spirit consumption presented with irregular palpitations and peripheral oedema. ECG confirmed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, and echocardiography showed a dilated, poorly contracting left ventricle. She was treated with digoxin, anticoagulation, and diuretics, with a focus on community-based alcohol abstinence programmes.

alcoholic_cardiomyopathy_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Early-stage alcoholic cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of cardiomegaly on chest X-ray
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male undergoing a routine pre-employment screen was found to have an enlarged heart on X-ray despite being asymptomatic. Detailed history revealed a high daily intake of strong lager (60 units/week), and an echocardiogram confirmed an EF of 42%. He was diagnosed with early ACM and achieved full recovery of cardiac function within one year through total alcohol abstinence.

alcoholic_cardiomyopathy_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic cardiomyopathy with ventricular tachycardia
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset syncope and chest fluttering
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with known heavy alcohol use collapsed and was found to be in monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. Following DC cardioversion, an echo showed a dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%) consistent with ACM. He received an ICD for secondary prevention and was started on a strict regimen of heart failure therapy and thiamine supplementation.

alcoholic_cardiomyopathy_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Mixed aetiology cardiomyopathy (Ischaemic and Alcoholic)
  presenting_complaint: Chest tightness and reduced exercise tolerance
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old male smoker with a history of hypertension and heavy alcohol use presented with stable angina and dyspnoea. Coronary angiography showed moderate non-obstructive CAD, but the degree of LV dilatation was disproportionate to the vascular disease, suggesting a significant alcoholic component. Management addressed both ischaemic risk factors and alcohol cessation.

alcoholic_cardiomyopathy_007:
  primary_diagnosis: End-stage alcoholic cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal bloating and profound fatigue
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with chronic ACM and multiple previous admissions presented with refractory ascites and cardiac cachexia. Echocardiography showed an EF of 15% with severe mitral regurgitation and a dilated right ventricle. Due to continued alcohol consumption, he was not a candidate for cardiac transplantation and was transitioned to a palliative care pathway for symptom management.

alcoholic_cardiomyopathy_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Rapidly progressive alcoholic cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: New-onset breathlessness over three weeks
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female with a five-year history of heavy wine consumption presented with rapid functional decline. Unlike typical slow progressions, her LV function deteriorated from normal to an EF of 20% in less than a month. Extensive viral and autoimmune screens were negative, and her condition was attributed to the toxic effects of alcohol, requiring intensive inpatient stabilisation.

alcoholic_cardiomyopathy_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Subclinical alcoholic cardiomyopathy in liver cirrhosis
  presenting_complaint: Routine follow-up for compensated cirrhosis
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with biopsy-proven alcoholic cirrhosis underwent a screening echocardiogram which revealed an asymptomatic EF of 38% and increased LV mass. This finding of ACM alongside liver disease necessitated careful fluid management to avoid precipitating hepatorenal syndrome. He was managed with low-dose spironolactone and close monitoring by both hepatology and cardiology teams.

alcoholic_cardiomyopathy_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic cardiomyopathy with LV mural thrombus
  presenting_complaint: Sudden weakness in the right arm and facial drooping
  summary_of_course: A 47-year-old male presented with an ischaemic stroke; a subsequent echocardiogram identified a large thrombus in the apex of a dilated, poorly contractile left ventricle (EF 22%). History confirmed a decades-long pattern of heavy spirit drinking. He was treated with therapeutic anticoagulation and standard heart failure therapy, alongside neurorehabilitation.

alcoholic_cardiomyopathy_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Treatment-resistant alcoholic cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent hospitalisations for fluid overload
  summary_of_course: A 53-year-old male with established ACM continued to consume 100+ units of alcohol weekly despite multiple medical interventions. He presented with "wet" heart failure every 4-6 weeks, requiring high-dose IV diuretics. His prognosis remained poor due to the ongoing direct toxic effect of ethanol on the myocardium and poor adherence to medical therapy.

alcoholic_cardiomyopathy_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic cardiomyopathy with Wet Beriberi
  presenting_complaint: High-output heart failure and peripheral neuropathy
  summary_of_course: A 46-year-old male with severe malnutrition and alcohol dependency presented with warm, oedematous limbs and a hyperdynamic circulation. Investigations showed a dilated heart but with features of high-output failure, alongside low serum thiamine levels. Treatment with IV Pabrinex and diuretics led to rapid initial improvement, confirming a dual aetiology of ACM and thiamine deficiency.

alcoholic_cardiomyopathy_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe alcoholic cardiomyopathy in a young adult
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal pain and vomiting (congestive hepatopathy)
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old male with a history of heavy vodka misuse since his teens presented with RUQ pain and jaundice. Investigations revealed severe congestive hepatopathy secondary to biventricular failure from ACM (EF 18%). He required admission to the CCU for inotropic support and was subsequently referred for long-term addiction rehabilitation.

alcoholic_cardiomyopathy_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (Community-managed)
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral ankle swelling and nocturnal cough
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male was seen by his GP for persistent lower limb oedema and a dry cough when lying flat. Blood tests showed a raised BNP, and a community echo confirmed dilated cardiomyopathy. After honest disclosure of his 70-unit/week alcohol habit, he was managed in the community with alcohol liaison services and titration of ACE inhibitors.

alcoholic_cardiomyopathy_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (Forensic presentation)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden death in the community
  summary_of_course: A 49-year-old male with a known history of alcohol dependence was found deceased at home. Post-mortem examination revealed a heavy, globose heart weighing 580g with four-chamber dilatation and histological evidence of interstitial fibrosis and myocyte hypertrophy. The cause of death was recorded as a fatal arrhythmia secondary to alcoholic cardiomyopathy.

alcoholic_cardiomyopathy_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic cardiomyopathy with secondary pulmonary hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Severe breathlessness and blue lips on exertion
  summary_of_course: A 57-year-old male with long-standing ACM presented with signs of right-sided heart failure and hypoxia. Right heart catheterisation confirmed post-capillary pulmonary hypertension secondary to chronic LV dysfunction from alcohol toxicity. He was treated with advanced diuretic strategies and long-term oxygen therapy, though his exercise capacity remained severely limited.

alcoholic_cardiomyopathy_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Electrolyte-triggered arrhythmia in alcoholic cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Dizziness and near-syncope
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male with ACM presented with symptomatic bradycardia and frequent ectopics. Labs revealed profound hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia, common in chronic alcoholics, which exacerbated his underlying myocardial irritability. Correction of electrolytes and stabilisation of his heart failure medications prevented the need for a permanent pacemaker.

alcoholic_cardiomyopathy_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Relapsed alcoholic cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Return of dyspnoea after two years of stability
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male whose EF had previously recovered from 25% to 50% following sobriety presented with a sudden relapse of heart failure. He admitted to resuming heavy drinking three months prior following a personal bereavement. His EF had dropped back to 20%, illustrating the high sensitivity of the "recovered" myocardium to further ethanol insults.

alcoholic_cardiomyopathy_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (Diagnostic challenge)
  presenting_complaint: Post-partum heart failure symptoms
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old female presented six weeks post-delivery with symptoms initially attributed to peripartum cardiomyopathy. However, a detailed social history revealed significant alcohol misuse throughout the pregnancy. The lack of recovery over six months despite standard therapy and continued drinking led to a revised diagnosis of ACM, highlighting the difficulty in distinguishing between different dilated cardiomyopathies.

alcoholic_cardiomyopathy_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic alcoholic cardiomyopathy in sepsis
  presenting_complaint: Fever, confusion, and hypotension
  summary_of_course: A 51-year-old male with underlying, undiagnosed ACM was admitted with community-acquired pneumonia. The physiological stress of sepsis caused rapid cardiac decompensation, leading to cardiogenic shock. Echocardiography in the ICU showed a severely dilated LV with an EF of 20%, requiring vasopressor and inotropic support to maintain systemic perfusion.
