  primary_diagnosis: Acute alcoholic pancreatitis with Delirium Tremens
  presenting_complaint: Agitation, tremors, and epigastric pain
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male was admitted with acute pancreatitis but quickly developed severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms, including visual hallucinations and tachycardia. Management required a combination of high-dose benzodiazepines (Chlordiazepoxide) alongside standard pancreatitis protocols. His recovery was complicated by poor compliance with nutritional support.

alcoholic_acute_pancreatitis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute alcoholic pancreatitis with normal amylase
  presenting_complaint: Severe upper abdominal pain and retching
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male presented 4 days after the onset of pain, with a serum amylase of only 95 U/L. Due to high clinical suspicion and a history of alcohol misuse, a CT scan was performed, confirming acute interstitial oedematous pancreatitis. This highlights the diagnostic challenge of late presentations where amylase levels may have already normalised.

alcoholic_acute_pancreatitis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute alcoholic pancreatitis with splenic vein thrombosis
  presenting_complaint: Left-sided abdominal pain and haematemesis
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male smoker and heavy drinker presented with acute pancreatitis complicated by splenic vein thrombosis. This led to isolated gastric varices and a significant upper gastrointestinal bleed. He was managed with therapeutic anticoagulation and eventually required splenectomy due to recurrent bleeding.

alcoholic_acute_pancreatitis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe alcoholic acute pancreatitis with acute kidney injury
  presenting_complaint: Anuria and severe abdominal distension
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old female presented with severe pancreatitis and rapidly rising creatinine indicative of Stage 3 AKI. She required continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVH) in the ICU for metabolic acidosis and fluid overload. Her renal function slowly recovered as the pancreatic inflammation subsided over three weeks.

alcoholic_acute_pancreatitis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute alcoholic pancreatitis with pancreatic ascites
  presenting_complaint: Increasing abdominal girth and dull ache
  summary_of_course: A 47-year-old male presented with massive ascites following a recent episode of alcoholic pancreatitis. Paracentesis revealed a very high fluid amylase level (>2000 U/L), confirming a pancreatic duct leak. He was treated with octreotide and ERCP-guided stenting of the pancreatic duct to bridge the disruption.

alcoholic_acute_pancreatitis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild alcoholic acute pancreatitis in an elderly patient
  presenting_complaint: Confusion and vague abdominal discomfort
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with long-term alcohol dependence presented with delirium and mild epigastric tenderness. Amylase was 450 U/L and CT confirmed mild inflammatory changes. Management was complicated by underlying frailty and malnutrition, requiring a multidisciplinary approach involving geriatricians and dietitians.

alcoholic_acute_pancreatitis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute alcoholic pancreatitis with pleural effusion
  presenting_complaint: Epigastric pain and pleuritic chest pain
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female presented with moderate pancreatitis and a large left-sided pleural effusion. Thoracocentesis confirmed an exudative effusion with high amylase content. The effusion resolved slowly following the successful management of the underlying pancreatic inflammation with bowel rest and IV fluids.

alcoholic_acute_pancreatitis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent alcoholic acute pancreatitis with exocrine insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent bouts of pain and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male with his fourth admission for alcoholic pancreatitis presented with mild symptoms but significant weight loss. Faecal elastase was found to be <50 μg/g, indicating severe exocrine insufficiency. He was started on Pancreatin (Creon) and referred to community alcohol services for long-term support.

  presenting_complaint: Fever, rigors, and worsening pain after initial improvement
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male initially improved after admission but developed a high fever on day 10. CT showed a peripancreatic fluid collection with gas bubbles, and fine-needle aspiration confirmed E. coli growth. He was treated with targeted intravenous antibiotics and percutaneous drainage, leading to eventual recovery.

alcoholic_acute_pancreatitis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute alcoholic pancreatitis with Type 3c Diabetes onset
  presenting_complaint: Thirst, polyuria, and abdominal pain
  summary_of_course: A 46-year-old male presented with acute pancreatitis and was found to be severely hyperglycaemic (glucose 22 mmol/L) with ketosis. This was identified as new-onset pancreatogenic diabetes due to extensive islet cell damage. He required a complex insulin regimen and intensive education on managing diabetes alongside alcohol cessation.

alcoholic_acute_pancreatitis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe alcoholic acute pancreatitis with multi-organ failure
  presenting_complaint: Collapse and profound shock
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old male was found collapsed after a prolonged drinking binge with a BP of 70/40 mmHg. He was diagnosed with severe pancreatitis and developed cardiovascular, renal, and hepatic failure within 24 hours. Despite maximal ICU support, he unfortunately succumbed to multi-organ failure on day 5.

alcoholic_acute_pancreatitis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute alcoholic pancreatitis with mesenteric venous thrombosis
  presenting_complaint: Bloating and post-prandial pain
  summary_of_course: A 51-year-old female presented with a two-week history of nagging abdominal pain and a history of heavy wine consumption. Imaging showed subacute pancreatitis and thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein. She was managed with long-term anticoagulation and nutritional optimization, avoiding bowel ischaemia.

alcoholic_acute_pancreatitis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute alcoholic pancreatitis with obstructive jaundice
  presenting_complaint: Yellowing of eyes and dark urine
  summary_of_course: A 43-year-old male presented with epigastric pain and jaundice (bilirubin 85 μmol/L). While initially suspected to be gallstones, imaging showed the head of the pancreas was severely oedematous from alcoholic pancreatitis, compressing the common bile duct. The jaundice resolved as the pancreatic inflammation subsided with conservative management.
