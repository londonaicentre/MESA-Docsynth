  primary_diagnosis: Turner Syndrome with Coeliac Disease
  presenting_complaint: Chronic abdominal bloating and iron-deficiency anaemia.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old girl with Turner syndrome was screened for associated autoimmune conditions during a routine annual review. Despite being asymptomatic, her tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies were significantly elevated (>200 U/mL). Distal duodenal biopsies confirmed Marsh 3c changes, and she was transitioned to a strict gluten-free diet.

turner_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Turner Syndrome with Madelung Deformity
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral wrist pain and limited range of motion.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old girl presented with progressive bowing of the radius and dorsal prominence of the ulna. Radiographs confirmed Madelung deformity, a common skeletal feature of Turner syndrome related to SHOX gene haploinsufficiency. She was managed with volar splints and referred for orthopaedic assessment regarding potential distal radius osteotomy.

turner_syndrome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Turner Syndrome (45,X/46,XY Mosaicism)
  presenting_complaint: Mild clitoromegaly noted at birth.
  summary_of_course: A neonate was referred for atypical genitalia; karyotype revealed a 45,X/46,XY mosaicism. Due to the presence of Y-chromosome material, the patient was at increased risk for gonadoblastoma. Laparoscopic prophylactic gonadectomy was performed at age 2, and histology confirmed the presence of streak gonads without malignant transformation.
