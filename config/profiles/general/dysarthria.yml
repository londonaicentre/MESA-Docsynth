  primary_diagnosis: Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden "scanning" speech and unsteadiness during a relapse
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female with known MS presented with a subacute onset of "jerky" speech where syllables were unnaturally separated. MRI brain showed new active demyelinating lesions in the cerebellum and brainstem. She was treated with a three-day course of intravenous methylprednisolone, resulting in partial resolution of her ataxic dysarthria over six weeks.

dysarthria_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Myasthenia Gravis
  presenting_complaint: Speech that becomes progressively slurred towards the end of the day
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female reported fluctuating dysarthria that was absent in the morning but worsened significantly by evening or after prolonged talking. A Tensilon test was positive, and serum anti-AChR antibodies were elevated.

  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic Cerebellar Degeneration
  presenting_complaint: Chronic "staccato" speech and persistent gait ataxia
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with a 30-year history of heavy alcohol consumption presented with permanent speech changes. Examination revealed ataxic dysarthria with irregular articulatory breakdowns and explosive vocal transitions. Despite complete abstinence from alcohol and high-dose thiamine supplementation, his dysarthria remained stable but irreversible due to established cerebellar atrophy.

dysarthria_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Wilson's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Tremor and slurred speech in a young adult
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male was referred to neurology with a "wing-beating" tremor and worsening dysarthria. Slit-lamp examination confirmed Kayser-Fleischer rings, and laboratory tests showed low serum caeruloplasmin. He was diagnosed with Wilson's disease and commenced on chelation therapy with penicillamine, showing gradual but significant improvement in his speech over eighteen months.

dysarthria_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Tardive Dyskinesia
  presenting_complaint: Involuntary tongue and jaw movements interfering with speech
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female with long-term schizophrenia on haloperidol developed repetitive grimacing and tongue protrusion. These involuntary movements caused a hyperkinetic dysarthria, making her speech sound irregular and strained. Her antipsychotic medication was switched to clozapine, and tetrabenazine was introduced, which partially alleviated the dyskinetic movements and improved speech clarity.

dysarthria_012:
  primary_diagnosis: ICU-Acquired Weakness
  presenting_complaint: Profound weakness and inability to speak clearly after prolonged ventilation
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male spent 40 days in ICU for septic shock and ARDS.

  primary_diagnosis: Wound Botulism
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of slurred speech, drooping eyelids, and difficulty swallowing
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old intravenous drug user presented to A&E with rapidly progressive cranial nerve palsies. Examination showed bilateral ptosis and a severe flaccid dysarthria with a nasal voice quality. He was diagnosed with wound botulism, treated with heptavalent botulinum antitoxin and surgical debridement, and required mechanical ventilation for 10 days before a slow recovery.

dysarthria_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Functional Neurological Disorder (FND)
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent, sudden-onset "child-like" speech
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female presented with episodes where her speech became suddenly slurred or high-pitched, often triggered by stress. Neurological examination and MRI brain were entirely normal, and the speech patterns did not conform to any specific neuroanatomical dysarthria type. She was diagnosed with functional dysarthria and showed improvement through specialist physiotherapy and psychological support.

  primary_diagnosis: Post-Carotid Endarterectomy Nerve Injury
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty pronouncing certain sounds following neck surgery
  summary_of_course: A 76-year-old male underwent a left carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic stenosis. Post-operatively, he noticed his tongue deviated to the left and he had difficulty with lingual consonants (e.g., 't', 'd', 'n'). This was diagnosed as a transient hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) neuropraxia; with SLT exercises, his articulation returned to baseline within four months.

dysarthria_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Huntington's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Jerky body movements and irregular, interrupted speech
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male with a family history of early-onset dementia presented with chorea and hyperkinetic dysarthria. His speech was characterised by sudden inhalatory gasps, variable rate, and inappropriate silences due to involuntary movements of the respiratory and laryngeal muscles. Genetic testing confirmed 45 CAG repeats, and he was managed with a multidisciplinary team for symptom control.
