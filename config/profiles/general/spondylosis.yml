spondylosis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Lumbar spondylosis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic lower back pain and stiffness.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male office worker presented to his GP with a 6-month history of mechanical back pain, worse in the mornings. Physical examination showed reduced lumbar flexion but no neurological deficits. Lumbar X-ray revealed osteophyte formation and disc space narrowing at L4-L5; he was managed with physiotherapy and paracetamol with moderate improvement.

spondylosis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Cervical spondylotic myelopathy
  presenting_complaint: Progressive gait instability and loss of fine motor skills in hands.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female presented with frequent falls and difficulty buttoning her blouse. MRI cervical spine demonstrated severe canal stenosis at C5-C6 with cord signal change (malacia). She underwent urgent decompressive laminectomy and posterior fusion to prevent further neurological decline, followed by inpatient rehabilitation.

spondylosis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Lumbar spondylosis with neurogenic claudication
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral leg pain and heaviness triggered by walking.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with hypertension and T2DM reported calf pain after walking 100 yards, relieved by leaning forward. MRI confirmed multilevel lumbar spondylosis with central canal stenosis. Due to his cardiac comorbidities, he was managed conservatively with epidural steroid injections and a paced walking programme.

spondylosis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Cervical spondylosis with radiculopathy
  presenting_complaint: Sharp pain radiating from the neck to the right thumb.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female presented with acute-on-chronic neck pain and paraesthesia in the C6 distribution. Examination revealed a diminished brachioradialis reflex and weak wrist extension. She was treated with a course of gabapentin and targeted nerve root blocks, resulting in significant symptom resolution over eight weeks.

spondylosis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Thoracic spondylosis
  presenting_complaint: Mid-back pain and band-like chest wall sensation.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male presented with persistent interscapular pain and occasional "electric shock" sensations around his ribcage. Initial investigations ruled out cardiac and pleuritic causes; thoracic MRI showed prominent anterior osteophytes and facet joint hypertrophy at T7-T9. Symptoms were managed with facet joint denervation and core strengthening exercises.

spondylosis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Multilevel spondylosis with Cauda Equina Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Acute urinary retention and saddle anaesthesia.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male with known chronic lumbar spondylosis presented emergently with sudden onset bowel incontinence and inability to void. Urgent MRI showed an acute disc prolapse superimposed on severe spondylotic stenosis at L4-L5. He underwent emergency surgical decompression within 6 hours of presentation, regaining partial bladder function post-operatively.

spondylosis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Cervicogenic dizziness secondary to cervical spondylosis
  presenting_complaint: Dizziness and neck stiffness upon head rotation.
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old female reported episodes of non-vestibular vertigo triggered by neck movement. Vestibular testing was normal, but cervical X-rays showed advanced uncovertebral joint hypertrophy. She responded well to manual therapy and vestibular rehabilitation exercises focusing on proprioceptive neck retraining.

spondylosis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Lumbar spondylosis with spondylolisthesis
  presenting_complaint: Severe "slipping" sensation in the back and bilateral sciatica.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female presented with Grade II degenerative spondylolisthesis at L5-S1 secondary to facet joint spondylosis. She failed conservative management over 12 months, experiencing worsening claudication. She subsequently underwent a transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) with good restoration of spinal alignment and pain relief.

spondylosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Early-onset lumbar spondylosis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent lower back pain after sports.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old former gymnast presented with chronic axial back pain. Imaging revealed premature degenerative disc disease and facet arthropathy at L5-S1, likely secondary to repetitive mechanical stress. Management focused on occupational health adjustments and long-term physiotherapy to maintain spinal stability.

spondylosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Cervical spondylosis with Vertebral Artery Insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Syncope during neck extension.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male experienced drop attacks when looking upwards. MRA demonstrated extrinsic compression of the vertebral artery by large osteophytes at the C3-C4 level (Bow Hunter's Syndrome). He was advised on activity modification and underwent surgical osteophyte resection to decompress the artery, preventing further syncopal episodes.

spondylosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Lumbar spondylosis in a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Worsening back pain and limited mobility.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female with long-standing RA presented with mechanical back pain that was poorly responsive to her usual DMARD therapy. MRI showed significant facet joint erosions and spondylotic changes distinct from her inflammatory disease. Pain management was escalated to include duloxetine and hydrotherapy, acknowledging the complexity of her dual pathology.

spondylosis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe cervical spondylosis mimicking Motor Neurone Disease
  presenting_complaint: Progressive weakness in all four limbs and muscle wasting.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male was referred to neurology with suspected MND due to widespread fasciculations and weakness. Detailed EMG and MRI revealed that the symptoms were actually due to multi-level cervical spondylotic amyotrophy. Decompressive surgery led to a stabilisation of his weakness, though muscle bulk recovery was limited.

spondylosis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic lumbar spondylosis with opioid dependence
  presenting_complaint: Refractory back pain and requests for increased analgesia.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with a 15-year history of spondylosis was admitted for pain crisis management. He had become increasingly dependent on high-dose oxycodone with diminishing returns. He was transitioned to a multidisciplinary pain management programme focusing on opioid tapering and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).

spondylosis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Lumbar spondylosis with foot drop
  presenting_complaint: Sudden inability to dorsiflex the left foot.
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male with chronic grumbling back pain developed acute weakness in his left foot (power 2/5). MRI showed a large osteophyte causing severe foraminal stenosis at L4-L5, compressing the L4 nerve root. Following an urgent foraminotomy, his foot strength improved to 4/5 over three months of intensive physiotherapy.

spondylosis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic cervical spondylosis
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding on trauma imaging.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female underwent a CT neck following a minor road traffic accident. While no fractures were found, the report noted moderate C5-C7 spondylosis with osteophytes. As she was entirely asymptomatic, she was reassured and advised on maintaining good posture and regular exercise, with no further intervention required.

spondylosis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Lumbar spondylosis with failed back surgery syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Persistent burning pain following laminectomy.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old female underwent decompression for spondylotic stenosis 12 months ago but reported worsening neuropathic pain. Repeat MRI showed extensive epidural fibrosis and adjacent segment spondylosis at L3-L4. She was referred to the chronic pain team for consideration of a spinal cord stimulator after failing further conservative measures.

spondylosis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Cervical spondylosis with occipital neuralgia
  presenting_complaint: Severe headaches starting at the base of the skull.
  summary_of_course: A 47-year-old male presented with paroxysmal shooting pains from the upper neck to the scalp. Examination revealed tenderness over the greater occipital nerve and restricted upper cervical motion. X-rays confirmed C1-C2 facet spondylosis; symptoms were successfully managed with C2 nerve root blocks and physical therapy.

spondylosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Lumbar spondylosis in an elderly patient with frailty
  presenting_complaint: Inability to mobilise at home due to pain.
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old female living alone was admitted following a decline in mobility. She had severe multilevel lumbar spondylosis and was fearful of falling. Management involved a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), optimization of non-opioid analgesia, and a social care package to facilitate a safe return home with walking aids.

spondylosis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Thoracolumbar spondylosis with kyphotic deformity
  presenting_complaint: Progressive "stooping" and difficulty looking forward.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male presented with a significant forward lean and chronic mid-back pain. Imaging showed multiple wedge-shaped degenerative changes and advanced spondylosis across the thoracolumbar junction. He was treated with a custom spinal brace and a specialized exercise programme to improve sagittal balance and reduce muscular fatigue.

spondylosis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Cervical spondylosis with pseudo-angina
  presenting_complaint: Left-sided chest pain and arm numbness.
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old male was admitted to the acute medical unit to rule out myocardial infarction. ECG and troponins were serialised and found to be normal; subsequent review identified that his chest pain was reproducible by neck palpation. MRI confirmed C6-C7 spondylosis with radicular referred pain (pseudo-angina), which resolved with cervical traction and anti-inflammatories.
