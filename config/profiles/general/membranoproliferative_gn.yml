  presenting_complaint: Malar rash, pleuritic chest pain, and oedema
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female with systemic lupus erythematosus presented with a flare. Renal biopsy showed a diffuse endocapillary proliferative pattern with "wire-loop" lesions and subendothelial deposits, characteristic of an MPGN-like pattern in Class IV lupus nephritis. She was treated with Mycophenolate Mofetil and high-dose prednisolone with good clinical response.

membranoproliferative_gn_012:
  primary_diagnosis: MPGN secondary to CLL
  presenting_complaint: Lymphadenopathy and nephrotic syndrome
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with known Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) developed heavy proteinuria (PCR 900 mg/mmol). Renal biopsy showed an MPGN pattern with evidence of lymphocytic infiltration in the interstitium. The renal disease was managed by treating the underlying leukaemia with targeted B-cell therapy, leading to a reduction in proteinuria.

  presenting_complaint: Ankle swelling and fatigue
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female was diagnosed with idiopathic Type I MPGN after presenting with a PCR of 300 mg/mmol and normal serum complements. She was treated with a combination of steroids and Mycophenolate Mofetil for 12 months. She achieved complete clinical remission with a PCR <15 mg/mmol and stable eGFR of 90 mL/min/1.73m².

membranoproliferative_gn_018:
  primary_diagnosis: MPGN with thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) features
  presenting_complaint: Pallor, jaundice, and decreased urine output
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male presented with features of both MPGN and TMA on renal biopsy, including schistocytes on blood film and low haptoglobin. This rare "overlap" presentation was linked to a deficiency in complement factor H-related proteins. He required eculizumab therapy to control the dysregulated complement activation and stabilise his renal function.

membranoproliferative_gn_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Elderly-onset idiopathic MPGN
  presenting_complaint: New-onset heart failure and renal impairment
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male was admitted with congestive heart failure and found to have a creatinine of 190 µmol/L and microscopic haematuria. Renal biopsy confirmed Type I MPGN, which was unusual for his age. Due to his frailty and comorbidities, he was managed conservatively with diuretics and low-dose ACE inhibition rather than aggressive immunosuppression.

membranoproliferative_gn_020:
  primary_diagnosis: MPGN Type I with rapid progression to ESRD
  presenting_complaint: Nausea, vomiting, and extreme lethargy
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male presented late with uraemic symptoms and an eGFR of 8 mL/min/1.73m². Biopsy showed advanced MPGN with 80% global glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis. He was commenced on chronic haemodialysis and added to the renal transplant waiting list, with plans for intensive complement monitoring post-transplant.
