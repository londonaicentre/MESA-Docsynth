  presenting_complaint: Painful, persistent erection lasting 6 hours
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old male with HbSS presented to the emergency department with a rigid, painful erection unrelated to sexual stimulation. Initial conservative measures failed, necessitating aspiration of the corpora cavernosa and irrigation with dilute phenylephrine by the urology team. He was subsequently started on etilefrine for prevention of recurrent episodes.

sickle_cell_disease_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Avascular necrosis of the femoral head
  presenting_complaint: Chronic progressive hip pain and limp
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male with HbSS reported worsening right hip pain that limited his mobility. MRI imaging confirmed Stage III osteonecrosis of the right femoral head with subchondral collapse. He underwent a successful total hip arthroplasty, significantly improving his quality of life and pain scores.

sickle_cell_disease_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Pulmonary hypertension secondary to SCD
  presenting_complaint: Progressive exertional dyspnoea and syncope
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with HbSS presented with reduced exercise tolerance. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV) of 3.2m/s, suggestive of pulmonary hypertension. Right heart catheterisation confirmed the diagnosis, and she was commenced on sildenafil and hydroxycarbamide to reduce haemolysis.

  primary_diagnosis: Proliferative sickle retinopathy
  presenting_complaint: New onset "floaters" and blurred vision in the left eye
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female with HbSC genotype attended a routine ophthalmology screening. Fundoscopy revealed "sea-fan" neovascularisation and evidence of a small vitreous haemorrhage. She was treated with peripheral retinal laser photocoagulation to prevent tractional retinal detachment.

  primary_diagnosis: Silent cerebral infarction
  presenting_complaint: Decline in school performance and cognitive testing
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old boy with HbSS underwent screening MRI as part of a research protocol following reports of academic struggling. Imaging revealed multiple small hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images despite no history of overt stroke. He was commenced on hydroxycarbamide to reduce the risk of further neurological injury.

  primary_diagnosis: Hyperhaemolytic crisis
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly falling haemoglobin following blood transfusion
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old female with HbSS received a transfusion for a vaso-occlusive crisis. Five days later, her Hb dropped from 90g/L to 40g/L, lower than her pre-transfusion baseline, with dark urine (haemoglobinuria). Diagnosis of hyperhaemolysis was made; she was treated with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone and IVIG, and further transfusions were strictly avoided.

  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male with HbSS on a long-term exchange transfusion programme for stroke prevention showed a rising serum ferritin of 4200ug/L. Liver MRI (R2*) indicated a liver iron concentration (LIC) of 15mg/g dry weight. He was commenced on oral chelation therapy with deferasirox, with serial monitoring of renal function and iron stores.

sickle_cell_disease_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Renal papillary necrosis in sickle cell trait
  presenting_complaint: Painless gross haematuria
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with sickle cell trait (HbAS) presented with a 2-day history of frank haematuria. Cystoscopy was normal, but CT urogram showed "sloughed papillae" in the renal pelvis. He was managed conservatively with bed rest and oral hydration, and the haematuria resolved spontaneously within 5 days.

sickle_cell_disease_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Multi-organ failure syndrome in SCD
  presenting_complaint: Severe pain, jaundice, and altered mental status
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male with HbSS was admitted with a severe pain crisis that rapidly progressed to acute respiratory distress, hepatic dysfunction (bilirubin 450umol/L), and acute kidney injury. He was transferred to the ICU for mechanical ventilation, continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVH), and emergency exchange transfusion. After a prolonged 3-week stay, he was stepped down to the ward for rehabilitation.
