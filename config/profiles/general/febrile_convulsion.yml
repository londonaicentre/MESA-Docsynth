febrile_convulsion_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Simple febrile convulsion
  presenting_complaint: Generalised tonic-clonic seizure lasting 3 minutes and high fever.
  summary_of_course: An 18-month-old male presented with a brief, self-limiting generalised seizure following a rapid rise in temperature to 39.2°C. Clinical examination revealed viral upper respiratory tract infection symptoms but no focal neurological deficits or meningism. He was managed with paracetamol and discharged from the A&E after a period of observation.

febrile_convulsion_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Complex febrile convulsion
  presenting_complaint: Focal seizure activity involving the left arm and leg lasting 12 minutes.
  summary_of_course: A 2-year-old female presented with a focal febrile seizure during a bout of acute otitis media. Unlike simple convulsions, this episode was lateralised and lasted longer than 10 minutes, requiring one dose of buccal midazolam. She was admitted for 24-hour observation; subsequent neurological examination was normal, and she was discharged with a safety net plan.

febrile_convulsion_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Febrile status epilepticus
  presenting_complaint: Continuous tonic-clonic seizure activity for 35 minutes.
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old boy was brought to the resus bay in active status epilepticus with a core temperature of 40.1°C. Despite two doses of midazolam, the seizure persisted, requiring intravenous phenobarbital and eventual intubation for airway protection. He was transferred to the PICU, where investigations ruled out meningitis, and he was diagnosed with febrile status epilepticus secondary to tonsillitis.

febrile_convulsion_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent simple febrile convulsions
  presenting_complaint: Two brief generalised seizures within a 24-hour period.
  summary_of_course: A 22-month-old girl experienced two separate 2-minute tonic-clonic episodes during a single febrile illness. Although each seizure was short, the recurrence within 24 hours classified the presentation as complex. Paediatric review confirmed a viral prodrome, and no long-term anticonvulsant therapy was initiated, but parents were educated on fever management.

febrile_convulsion_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Febrile convulsion with Todd's Paresis
  presenting_complaint: Seizure followed by right-sided weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old male presented with a 5-minute febrile seizure followed by significant hemiparesis of the right side lasting two hours. Urgent CT head was unremarkable, and the weakness resolved completely, confirming Todd’s paresis. He was diagnosed with a complex febrile convulsion and monitored until his neurological status returned to baseline.

febrile_convulsion_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Simple febrile convulsion post-immunisation
  presenting_complaint: Brief seizure 24 hours after MMR vaccination.
  summary_of_course: A 13-month-old female developed a temperature of 38.8°C and a 2-minute generalised seizure the day after her routine vaccinations. Clinical assessment found no other source of infection, and the episode was attributed to a post-immunisation febrile response. The parents were reassured that this does not contraindicate future vaccinations.

febrile_convulsion_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Febrile convulsion in the setting of gastroenteritis
  presenting_complaint: Seizure associated with vomiting, diarrhoea, and fever.
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old girl with a 2-day history of rotavirus gastroenteritis suffered a 4-minute seizure when her temperature spiked. Blood tests showed mild dehydration but normal electrolytes, ruling out hyponatraemic seizures. She was treated with oral rehydration and paracetamol, with no further seizure activity noted.

febrile_convulsion_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Febrile convulsion with underlying Iron Deficiency Anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Generalised seizure and pale appearance.
  summary_of_course: A 20-month-old male presented with a typical simple febrile convulsion during a viral illness. Routine bloods revealed a significant microcytic anaemia (Hb 82 g/L), which is a known risk factor for lowering the seizure threshold in febrile children. He was started on iron supplementation alongside standard post-seizure advice.

febrile_convulsion_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Atypical febrile convulsion in an older child
  presenting_complaint: First-time seizure at age 7 during a high fever.
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old boy presented with a 5-minute tonic-clonic seizure and a temperature of 39.5°C. Given his age was outside the typical 6 months to 5 years range, he underwent an EEG and lumbar puncture to exclude epilepsy and encephalitis. All investigations were normal, leading to a diagnosis of an atypical late-onset febrile convulsion.

febrile_convulsion_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Febrile convulsion with suspected Meningitis
  presenting_complaint: Seizure, fever, and non-blanching rash.
  summary_of_course: A 15-month-old infant presented with a 3-minute seizure and a petechial rash on the trunk. Due to the high risk of meningococcal septicaemia, intravenous ceftriaxone was administered immediately. Blood cultures and LP later proved negative for bacterial infection, and the seizure was confirmed as a simple febrile convulsion secondary to a viral exanthem.

febrile_convulsion_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Complex febrile convulsion with prolonged post-ictal state
  presenting_complaint: Seizure followed by 4 hours of reduced consciousness.
  summary_of_course: A 2-year-old female had a 10-minute febrile seizure but remained unusually drowsy for several hours afterward (GCS 10). She was admitted for observation and neuroimaging, which showed no abnormalities. Her consciousness level gradually returned to normal, and the prolonged post-ictal state was attributed to the severity of the initial febrile insult.

febrile_convulsion_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Febrile convulsion with Roseola Infantum
  presenting_complaint: High fever and seizure followed by a maculopapular rash.
  summary_of_course: A 10-month-old male presented with a 4-minute seizure during a period of high unexplained fever. Two days later, the fever subsided and a classic rose-coloured rash appeared on the trunk. This confirmed Roseola Infantum (HHV-6) as the underlying cause of the febrile convulsion.

febrile_convulsion_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Febrile convulsion in a child with developmental delay
  presenting_complaint: Seizure in a child with known Trisomy 21.
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old with Down's syndrome presented with a 6-minute generalised febrile seizure. Given his background of developmental delay, there was concern for a lower seizure threshold. He was monitored closely in the paediatric ward but required no long-term antiepileptic medication as the episode was clearly triggered by a pyrexial illness.

febrile_convulsion_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Simple febrile convulsion with family history
  presenting_complaint: Brief tonic-clonic seizure during a cold.
  summary_of_course: A 2-year-old male presented with a 2-minute seizure; his father and older sister both had histories of simple febrile convulsions in early childhood. The clinical presentation was textbook, and the strong family history provided further diagnostic confidence. No further investigations were required, and the family were given rescue medication advice for future episodes.

febrile_convulsion_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Febrile convulsion secondary to Urinary Tract Infection
  presenting_complaint: Unexplained fever and a 5-minute seizure.
  summary_of_course: An 11-month-old girl presented with a seizure but no obvious respiratory symptoms. Urinalysis showed nitrites and leucocytes, and urine culture grew E. coli. The seizure was diagnosed as a simple febrile convulsion secondary to a pyelonephritis, which was treated with a 10-day course of antibiotics.

febrile_convulsion_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Complex febrile convulsion (prolonged)
  presenting_complaint: Seizure lasting 18 minutes.
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old boy was brought by ambulance after a seizure that did not stop spontaneously. Paramedics administered rectal diazepam at 12 minutes, which terminated the event at 18 minutes. He was admitted to the paediatric assessment unit for 12 hours of monitoring and was discharged once he was afebrile and neurologically intact.

febrile_complaint_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Febrile convulsion with Upper Respiratory Tract Infection
  presenting_complaint: Seizure occurring at the start of a febrile illness.
  summary_of_course: A 2-year-old female had a 3-minute seizure just as her temperature began to rise, before any other symptoms were evident. A few hours later, she developed a cough and rhinorrhoea. This is a common presentation where the seizure is the first sign of an impending viral illness in a susceptible child.

febrile_convulsion_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Febrile convulsion with electrolyte derangement
  presenting_complaint: Seizure in a child with fever and mild hyponatraemia.
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old male with a high fever and poor oral intake had a 7-minute seizure. Bloods showed a sodium of 131 mmol/L, likely due to SIADH-like response to infection. While the fever was the primary trigger, the mild hyponatraemia may have contributed to the seizure duration. He was managed with fluid restriction and antipyretics.

febrile_convulsion_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Febrile convulsion in a child with previous neonatal seizures
  presenting_complaint: Generalised seizure during a flu-like illness.
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old girl with a history of benign neonatal convulsions presented with a 4-minute febrile seizure. Because of her prior history, she was reviewed by a paediatric neurologist. It was determined that this was a standard febrile convulsion unrelated to her neonatal history, and no change in management was required.

febrile_convulsion_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Simple febrile convulsion (community management)
  presenting_complaint: Brief seizure at home, now recovered.
  summary_of_course: A 2-year-old male was seen by his GP two hours after a 2-minute seizure that occurred during a fever. By the time of the consultation, the child was alert, playing, and had a temperature of 37.5°C. The GP confirmed the diagnosis of a simple febrile convulsion and provided the parents with a "Safety Net" leaflet, avoiding an unnecessary hospital admission.
