She required a prolonged course of systemic corticosteroids to resolve the parotid swelling and neurological deficits.

sarcoidosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Hepatosplenic sarcoidosis
  presenting_complaint: Right upper quadrant discomfort and pruritus
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female presented with hepatosplenomegaly and a cholestatic liver function profile (ALP 580 U/L). Liver biopsy showed multiple non-caseating granulomas within the portal tracts. She was treated with Ursodeoxycholic acid and Prednisolone, resulting in a gradual improvement in her biochemistry.

sarcoidosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric sarcoidosis (Early-onset)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent rash, joint stiffness, and red eyes
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy presented with a maculopapular rash and bilateral knee effusions. Investigations revealed granulomatous uveitis and a negative rheumatoid factor. Genetic testing for Blau syndrome was negative, and he was managed with Methotrexate to control systemic granulomatous inflammation.

sarcoidosis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory sarcoidosis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent dyspnoea despite dual immunosuppression
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old female with Stage III pulmonary sarcoidosis remained symptomatic despite 15mg Prednisolone and 20mg Methotrexate weekly. Repeat HRCT showed progressing parenchymal opacities. Following a multidisciplinary review, she was commenced on Infliximab infusions, which led to a 15% improvement in her Forced Vital Capacity (FVC).
