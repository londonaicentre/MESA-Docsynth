cluster_headache_syndrome_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Episodic cluster headache
  presenting_complaint: Severe right-sided periorbital pain and eye watering.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male presented to his GP with a 2-week history of daily excruciating retro-orbital pain lasting 45 minutes, occurring 3 times daily. Examination noted conjunctival injection and lacrimation on the affected side. He was diagnosed with episodic cluster headache and commenced on high-flow 15L/min oxygen and subcutaneous sumatriptan as required, with excellent initial response.

cluster_headache_syndrome_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic cluster headache
  presenting_complaint: Daily stabbing headaches for 14 months without remission.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female with a long history of headaches reported no pain-free periods for over a year. Despite trials of Verapamil up to 480mg daily, she continued to experience 2-4 attacks per day, often waking her from sleep. She was referred to a specialist neurology clinic for consideration of galcanezumab or a greater occipital nerve block.

cluster_headache_syndrome_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric cluster headache
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent nocturnal eye pain and nasal congestion.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old boy presented with a 3-week bout of severe unilateral headaches occurring 2 hours after falling asleep. Initially misdiagnosed as acute sinusitis in A&E, the presence of ptosis and miosis during the attack led to a paediatric neurology review. He was successfully managed with sumatriptan nasal spray and a short course of oral prednisolone to break the cycle.

cluster_headache_syndrome_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Late-onset cluster headache
  presenting_complaint: New-onset severe unilateral headache in a 75-year-old.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female presented with sudden, intense right-sided temporal and orbital pain. Given her age, giant cell arteritis was excluded via normal ESR/CRP and temporal artery ultrasound. The clinical presentation of 30-minute attacks with associated rhinorrhoea confirmed cluster headache, and she was started on low-dose Verapamil with cardiac monitoring.

cluster_headache_syndrome_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic cluster headache syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Agonising "suicide headache" with extreme agitation.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with known chronic cluster headaches presented to A&E in an acute crisis, pacing the room and hitting his head. He had failed multiple prophylactic agents and was currently experiencing 8 attacks per day. He was admitted for high-dose oxygen therapy and an emergent sphenopalatine ganglion block to provide immediate relief.

cluster_headache_syndrome_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Cluster-Tic syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Overlapping orbital pain and electric-shock sensations in the jaw.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male presented with classic cluster headache symptoms (autonomic features, 60-minute duration) but also reported brief, seconds-long stabs of lancinating pain in the V2 distribution. MRI of the brain was unremarkable for neurovascular conflict. He was diagnosed with Cluster-Tic syndrome and required a combination of Verapamil and Carbamazepine to achieve symptom control.

cluster_headache_syndrome_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary cluster headache (Pituitary microadenoma)
  presenting_complaint: Refractory cluster-like headaches.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male presented with typical cluster headache features that were unusually resistant to standard treatments. An MRI of the pituitary gland revealed a 4mm microadenoma. Following medical management of the adenoma, the frequency and intensity of the cluster-like attacks significantly diminished, suggesting a secondary aetiology.

cluster_headache_syndrome_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Episodic cluster headache with OSA comorbidity
  presenting_complaint: Severe nocturnal headaches and daytime sleepiness.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old obese male (BMI 34) reported intense unilateral headaches occurring exclusively at night. Polysomnography confirmed severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) with an AHI of 45. While CPAP therapy improved his daytime fatigue, he required Verapamil to fully suppress the cluster bouts, which were being triggered by nocturnal hypoxia.

cluster_headache_syndrome_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory chronic cluster headache
  presenting_complaint: Persistent daily attacks failing multiple preventatives.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male had failed Verapamil, Lithium, Topiramate, and Methysergide over a five-year period. He underwent a trial of occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) after a successful greater occipital nerve block. Post-implantation, he reported a 60% reduction in attack frequency and a significant decrease in pain intensity.

cluster_headache_syndrome_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild episodic cluster headache
  presenting_complaint: Short annual bouts of orbital pressure and tearing.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female experienced a 2-week bout of moderate unilateral orbital pain every autumn. The attacks lasted 20 minutes and occurred once daily, allowing for management with sumatriptan nasal spray alone. Due to the short duration and predictability of the bouts, long-term prophylaxis was not deemed necessary by her neurologist.

cluster_headache_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Cluster headache with transient Horner's syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Severe left-sided headache with a drooping eyelid.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male presented during an active bout with marked ptosis and miosis on the left side. Neurological examination during the attack confirmed Horner’s syndrome, which resolved completely between episodes. He was treated with a tapering dose of prednisolone and Verapamil, with subsequent resolution of the autonomic signs.

cluster_headache_syndrome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-traumatic cluster headache syndrome
  presenting_complaint: New onset clusters following a significant head injury.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male developed classic episodic cluster headaches six months after a motor vehicle accident involving a closed head injury. MRI and CT imaging were normal, but the temporal relationship suggested post-traumatic induction. He responded well to standard cluster protocols, including high-flow oxygen and Topiramate.

cluster_headache_syndrome_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Cluster headache with medication-overuse headache
  presenting_complaint: Increasing frequency of headaches and daily triptan use.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female with known cluster headaches began using subcutaneous sumatriptan up to four times daily, leading to a daily background headache. She was admitted for a planned withdrawal of triptans and initiation of intravenous dihydroergotamine. Following detoxification and starting Lithium, her cluster attacks returned to their baseline episodic pattern.

cluster_headache_syndrome_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Episodic cluster headache in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Intense orbital pain during the second trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant patient presented with a new bout of cluster headaches. Due to the pregnancy, many standard preventatives were contraindicated; she was managed primarily with high-flow 100% oxygen and occasional sumatriptan nasal spray. The bout lasted 4 weeks and resolved spontaneously without obstetric complications.

cluster_headache_syndrome_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic cluster headache with cardiovascular comorbidities
  presenting_complaint: Refractory headaches in a patient with heart block.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with ischaemic heart disease and first-degree AV block required cluster prophylaxis. Verapamil was contraindicated due to the risk of worsening heart block, so he was started on Lithium carbonate. Regular monitoring of serum lithium levels and thyroid function was performed, resulting in stable headache control.

cluster_headache_syndrome_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Episodic cluster headache, alcohol-triggered
  presenting_complaint: Immediate headache onset following alcohol consumption.
  summary_of_course: A 37-year-old male noted that during certain months of the year, a single glass of beer would trigger an excruciating orbital headache within 10 minutes. This classic "trigger" phenomenon helped confirm the diagnosis of episodic cluster headache. He was advised on trigger avoidance during bouts and prescribed sumatriptan for acute relief.

cluster_headache_syndrome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Long-remission episodic cluster headache
  presenting_complaint: Recurrence of severe headaches after 15 years.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male presented with a sudden relapse of cluster headaches after a 15-year pain-free period. He was initially concerned about intracranial pathology, but a normal MRI and the familiar nature of the pain confirmed a relapse of his cluster syndrome. He was successfully treated with a greater occipital nerve block and Verapamil.

cluster_headache_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Status cluster
  presenting_complaint: Continuous, unrelenting cluster attacks over 48 hours.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male was admitted to the neurology ward with "status cluster," experiencing back-to-back attacks with almost no pain-free intervals. He was treated with an urgent intravenous methylprednisolone bolus and started on a rapid Verapamil titration. This aggressive approach broke the cycle within 72 hours, and he was discharged on oral preventatives.

cluster_headache_syndrome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Episodic cluster headache (Diagnostic challenge)
  presenting_complaint: Unilateral headache initially thought to be dental pain.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old female underwent two unnecessary dental extractions for what was believed to be severe toothache. When the pain persisted and developed associated eye redness and tearing, she was referred to neurology. The diagnosis of cluster headache was made, and her "dental" pain vanished upon starting appropriate cluster prophylaxis.

cluster_headache_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic cluster headache with suicidal ideation
  presenting_complaint: Severe pain with expressed intent to self-harm.
  summary_of_course: A 46-year-old male with refractory chronic cluster headache was brought to A&E by family due to suicidal ideation during a peak pain episode. He was admitted to a high-dependency unit for pain management and psychiatric support. A multidisciplinary team initiated a trial of non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) alongside intensive psychological counselling for chronic pain.
