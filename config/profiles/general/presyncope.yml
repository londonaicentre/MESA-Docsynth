  presenting_complaint: Persistent postural dizziness and postprandial bloating
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female with a 30-year history of Type 1 diabetes reported chronic presyncope that was worse in the mornings. Investigations showed a lack of heart rate variability during deep breathing and significant orthostatic hypotension. Treatment involved midodrine and lifestyle modifications, though her response was only partial due to the severity of the underlying nerve damage.

presyncope_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Cyanotic breath-holding spell
  presenting_complaint: Turning blue and becoming limp after a crying episode
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old boy was brought to the paediatrician after he stopped breathing and nearly lost consciousness following a minor fall. His mother described him turning blue around the lips before becoming briefly unresponsive but not completely unconscious. The clinical diagnosis was a breath-holding spell; the parents were reassured of the benign nature of the condition and no further investigations were required.

presyncope_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Hyperventilation syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Perioral tingling, carpopedal spasm, and feeling "faint"
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female was brought to A&E by ambulance during a period of intense work stress. She was tachypnoeic and reported a terrifying sensation of being unable to breathe followed by severe presyncope. Arterial blood gas showed a respiratory alkalosis with a low pCO2; symptoms resolved with breathing retraining and psychological support for panic disorder.
