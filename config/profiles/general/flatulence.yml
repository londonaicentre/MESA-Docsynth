flatulence_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Lactose intolerance
  presenting_complaint: Chronic bloating and excessive flatulence after dairy consumption
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female presents with a 6-month history of abdominal distension and flatulence occurring 2 hours after consuming milk. Symptoms are mild but persistent, with no weight loss or anaemia. A hydrogen breath test confirmed lactose malabsorption. Management involves a lactose-free diet and lactase enzyme supplements, resulting in complete symptom resolution.

flatulence_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Coeliac disease
  presenting_complaint: Malodorous flatulence, fatigue, and iron-deficiency anaemia
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male reports subacute onset of foul-smelling wind and loose stools over 4 months. Blood tests revealed an iron-deficiency anaemia and positive IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies. Duodenal biopsy confirmed Marsh 3a changes. Introduction of a strict gluten-free diet led to significant reduction in flatulence and improvement in energy levels.

flatulence_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO)
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal bloating and frequent flatulence following gastric surgery
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female with a history of partial gastrectomy presents with chronic, severe flatulence and unintentional weight loss. Glucose hydrogen breath testing was positive for SIBO. A 14-day course of Rifaximin 550mg TDS was prescribed. The patient reported a 70% reduction in flatulence frequency at the 4-week follow-up.

flatulence_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS-M)
  presenting_complaint: Alternating bowel habits, cramping, and socially debilitating flatulence
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female presents with a 2-year history of chronic abdominal pain relieved by defecation, associated with excessive wind. Investigations including faecal calprotectin and coeliac serology were normal. Diagnosis of IBS-mixed type was made. Management with a low FODMAP diet and Mebeverine significantly improved the flatulence and bloating.

flatulence_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Giardiasis
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of explosive diarrhoea and "sulphur-smelling" flatulence
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male developed acute gastrointestinal distress following a hiking trip where he consumed untreated stream water. He describes extremely malodorous flatus and greasy stools. Stool PCR was positive for Giardia lamblia. A single dose of Tinidazole successfully eradicated the pathogen and resolved the symptoms.

flatulence_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Colonic Pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's Syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Massive abdominal distension and inability to pass flatus
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male inpatient, recovering from a fractured neck of femur, developed acute, life-threatening abdominal distension. Plain film X-ray showed significant colonic dilatation without mechanical obstruction. Following failed conservative management, intravenous Neostigmine was administered in the HDU setting. This prompted the passage of large volumes of flatus and rapid decompression.

flatulence_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Pancreatic Exocrine Insufficiency (PEI)
  presenting_complaint: Steatorrhoea and chronic, painful flatulence
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old male with cystic fibrosis presents with worsening flatulence and oily stools despite current enzyme therapy. Faecal elastase was found to be severely low (<50 ug/g). Adjusting the Pancreatin (Creon) dosage and ensuring it was taken mid-meal led to a marked reduction in gastrointestinal symptoms and improved weight gain.

flatulence_008:
  primary_diagnosis: High FODMAP dietary intolerance
  presenting_complaint: Mild but persistent flatulence and gurgling (borborygmi)
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old healthy female reported increased wind after increasing her intake of legumes and cruciferous vegetables. Clinical examination and baseline bloods were unremarkable. A dietetic review identified a high intake of fermentable carbohydrates. Reduction in specific high-FODMAP foods resulted in the flatulence returning to a baseline acceptable level.

flatulence_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-operative ileus
  presenting_complaint: Nausea and absence of flatus following laparotomy
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male, three days post-elective bowel resection, developed moderate abdominal distension and had not passed flatus since surgery. Clinical diagnosis of post-operative ileus was made. Management included nasogastric tube insertion, IV fluids, and mobilisation. Flatus returned on post-operative day five, allowing for gradual reintroduction of oral intake.

flatulence_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Diverticular disease
  presenting_complaint: Left iliac fossa pain and increased flatulence
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male presents with chronic, subacute episodes of left-sided abdominal discomfort and excessive wind. Colonoscopy revealed multiple diverticula in the sigmoid colon but no malignancy or inflammation. He was advised on a high-fibre diet and increased fluid intake. This regimen successfully managed the flatulence and prevented further episodes of diverticulitis.

flatulence_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Metformin-induced gastrointestinal side effects
  presenting_complaint: Acute bloating and flatulence following initiation of T2DM medication
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male recently diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus was started on Metformin 500mg BD. Within 48 hours, he experienced moderate flatulence and loose stools. The symptoms were attributed to the medication. Switching to a modified-release formulation (Metformin SR) significantly improved his gastrointestinal tolerance while maintaining glycaemic control.

flatulence_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Crohn's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Acute-on-chronic flatulence, right lower quadrant pain, and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female with a history of "sensitive stomach" presented with severe flatulence and bloody diarrhoea. Faecal calprotectin was elevated at 850 ug/g. Colonoscopy and biopsy confirmed ileocolonic Crohn's disease. Treatment with Prednisolone and subsequent Infliximab infusions led to mucosal healing and cessation of the excessive flatus.

flatulence_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Aerophagia
  presenting_complaint: Repetitive belching and frequent flatulence throughout the day
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male with generalized anxiety disorder complained of constant wind. Observation during the consultation revealed frequent air swallowing. He was diagnosed with aerophagia secondary to stress. Management involved cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and speech therapy for breathing techniques, which reduced the volume of swallowed air and subsequent flatulence.

flatulence_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Fructose malabsorption
  presenting_complaint: Bloating and flatulence specifically after fruit consumption
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old female noted that eating apples, pears, and honey triggered significant flatulence and abdominal noise. A fructose hydrogen breath test was positive. She was educated on a low-fructose diet by a dietitian. Following these dietary modifications, her symptoms of flatulence and distension were reduced by approximately 80%.

flatulence_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Cholecystitis
  presenting_complaint: Post-prandial flatulence and right upper quadrant heaviness
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female presents with subacute dyspepsia and flatulence, particularly after fatty meals. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated multiple gallstones and a thickened gallbladder wall. She underwent an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Post-operatively, her "fatty food intolerance" and associated flatulence resolved completely.

flatulence_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Ovarian Malignancy
  presenting_complaint: New-onset persistent flatulence and increased abdominal girth
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old female presented with a 3-month history of "feeling gassy" and needing to loosen her waistband. Initially managed as IBS in the community, her symptoms persisted. An urgent CA-125 was elevated (240 U/mL), and a CT scan revealed a complex adnexal mass and ascites. She was referred to the gynaecology-oncology multidisciplinary team for urgent intervention.

flatulence_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Short Bowel Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Severe malabsorption and voluminous, frequent flatulence
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male who underwent extensive small bowel resection for mesenteric ischaemia suffers from chronic, severe flatulence and watery diarrhoea. Despite high-dose proton pump inhibitors and loperamide, gas production remains high due to rapid transit and colonic fermentation. Management involves tailored parenteral nutrition and Teduglutide to improve intestinal absorption.

flatulence_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic Gastroparesis
  presenting_complaint: Early satiety, bloating, and foul-smelling flatulence
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female with a 20-year history of Type 1 Diabetes presents with chronic nausea and "rotten egg" smelling wind. A gastric emptying scintigraphy study showed 40% retention at 4 hours, confirming gastroparesis. Treatment with Domperidone and a low-fibre, small-meal diet helped reduce the fermentation of stagnant food and associated flatulence.

flatulence_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Antibiotic-associated dysbiosis
  presenting_complaint: Excessive flatulence and soft stools following a course of Clindamycin
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female developed moderate flatulence and change in bowel habit one week after finishing antibiotics for a dental abscess. C. difficile toxin PCR was negative. The symptoms were attributed to a disruption of the gut microbiota (dysbiosis). A 4-week course of multi-strain probiotics was recommended, leading to gradual normalization of gas production.

flatulence_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Non-IgE mediated cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA)
  presenting_complaint: Excessive wind, colic, and eczema in an infant
  summary_of_course: An 18-month-old toddler presented with persistent flatulence, abdominal discomfort, and patches of eczema. The mother noted symptoms worsened with whole milk introduction. A 4-week trial of a strict cow's milk elimination diet resulted in a significant reduction in flatulence and skin improvement. Reintroduction triggered symptoms, confirming non-IgE CMPA.
