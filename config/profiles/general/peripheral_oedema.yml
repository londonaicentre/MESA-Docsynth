  primary_diagnosis: Lower Limb Cellulitis
  presenting_complaint: Red, hot, and swollen right leg.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with type 2 diabetes presented with acute unilateral swelling accompanied by erythema and pyrexia. Inflammatory markers were elevated with a CRP of 145 mg/L. He was treated with intravenous flucloxacillin for 48 hours before transitioning to oral antibiotics as the oedema and redness receded.

peripheral_oedema_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Protein-Losing Enteropathy
  presenting_complaint: Generalized swelling and chronic diarrhoea.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female with known Crohn's disease presented with generalized peripheral oedema (anasarca). Investigations revealed profound hypoproteinaemia despite normal liver and renal function, and a technetium-labelled albumin scan confirmed enteric protein loss. Management focused on optimizing her underlying inflammatory bowel disease and nutritional support.

peripheral_oedema_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Myxoedema (Severe Hypothyroidism)
  presenting_complaint: Non-pitting leg swelling and lethargy.
