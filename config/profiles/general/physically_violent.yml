MRI brain imaging showed marked bilateral frontal lobe atrophy. Unlike Alzheimer's, his memory was relatively preserved, but his lack of empathy and loss of inhibition led to unpredictable physical aggression, requiring placement in a specialist dementia unit.

  primary_diagnosis: Anti-NMDA Receptor Encephalitis
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive psychosis and violent outbursts.
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old female presented with "bizarre" behaviour, progressing to severe physical violence and catatonia within two weeks.

On weaning from sedation in the ICU, he developed severe agitation and was physically violent, kicking nurses and attempting to remove his endotracheal tube. This was attributed to mild hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. He was managed with a dexmedetomidine infusion, which provided sedation without respiratory depression, allowing for a safer weaning process.

  presenting_complaint: Chronic biting and scratching of caregivers.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female with a severe learning disability and no verbal communication presented with a spike in physical violence, specifically biting and scratching.
