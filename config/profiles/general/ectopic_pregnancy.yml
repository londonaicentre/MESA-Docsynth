ectopic_pregnancy_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Ruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset severe lower abdominal pain and syncope
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female presented to A&E with acute pelvic pain and signs of haemorrhagic shock. Ultrasound confirmed a ruptured right-sided tubal pregnancy with significant haemoperitoneum. She underwent urgent laparoscopic salpingectomy, received two units of packed red cells for acute anaemia, and was discharged after 48 hours.

ectopic_pregnancy_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Unruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Mild left iliac fossa pain and dark vaginal spotting
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old G2P1 presented at 6 weeks gestation with subacute discomfort. TVS revealed a 2cm unruptured pregnancy in the left fallopian tube and a serum beta-hCG of 1,200 IU/L. She was managed successfully with a single dose of intramuscular methotrexate and followed up with serial hCG monitoring until resolution.

ectopic_pregnancy_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic ectopic pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Persistent pelvic heaviness and irregular bleeding for three weeks
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old woman with a history of PID presented with a complex adnexal mass on ultrasound and low, plateauing hCG levels. Laparoscopy identified a chronic ectopic pregnancy encased in dense adhesions, necessitating a difficult salpingo-oophorectomy. Histopathology confirmed degenerate products of conception within the fallopian tube.

ectopic_pregnancy_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Caesarean scar ectopic pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic, diagnosed at routine dating scan
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old with two previous caesarean sections was found to have a gestational sac implanted within the lower uterine segment scar at 7 weeks. Due to the high risk of uterine rupture, she underwent ultrasound-guided suction curettage with prophylactic uterine artery embolisation. Her recovery was uncomplicated with weekly hCG follow-up.

ectopic_pregnancy_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Heterotopic pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Acute abdominal pain following IVF embryo transfer
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old patient presented with RIF pain despite a confirmed intrauterine pregnancy on scan. A second, live ectopic pregnancy was identified in the right tube during an emergency laparoscopy. The ectopic was removed via salpingectomy, and the intrauterine pregnancy remained viable, continuing to full term.

ectopic_pregnancy_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Interstitial (cornual) ectopic pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Severe left-sided pain and heavy vaginal bleeding at 10 weeks gestation
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old G4P3 presented with late-first trimester pain; imaging showed a pregnancy in the interstitial portion of the left tube. Due to the risk of catastrophic haemorrhage, she underwent a laparoscopic cornual resection. She required intraoperative blood transfusion but recovered well postoperatively.

ectopic_pregnancy_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Cervical ectopic pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Profuse, painless vaginal bleeding
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old presented with life-threatening vaginal haemorrhage; examination revealed a soft, dilated cervix containing a gestational sac. Initial management involved cervical cerclage and balloon tamponade to control bleeding, followed by systemic methotrexate. She avoided a hysterectomy and her hCG returned to pre-pregnancy levels over six weeks.

ectopic_pregnancy_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Ovarian ectopic pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Right-sided pelvic pain mimicking acute appendicitis
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old was admitted for suspected appendicitis, but a positive pregnancy test and TVS suggested an adnexal mass with a yolk sac. Intraoperatively, the right ovary was found to contain the ectopic pregnancy while the tube was healthy. A wedge resection of the ovary was performed, preserving the remaining ovarian tissue.

ectopic_pregnancy_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Abdominal ectopic pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Persistent abdominal pain and gastrointestinal upset at 14 weeks
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old presented with late-onset abdominal pain and fetal parts palpable just under the abdominal wall. MRI confirmed a primary abdominal pregnancy attached to the broad ligament and omentum. She underwent a laparotomy for surgical removal, which required careful dissection to avoid bowel injury.

ectopic_pregnancy_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Ruptured ectopic pregnancy with IUD in situ
  presenting_complaint: Sharp pelvic pain and shoulder tip pain
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old using a copper IUD presented with acute peritonitis and referred shoulder pain. Ultrasound showed a ruptured tubal pregnancy and a correctly placed IUD, which was removed during an emergency laparoscopic salpingectomy. This case highlights that while IUDs are effective, pregnancies that do occur are more likely to be ectopic.

ectopic_pregnancy_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Failed medical management of ectopic pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Increasing abdominal pain 5 days after methotrexate injection
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old initially treated with methotrexate for a 3cm tubal ectopic presented with worsening pain and a 2g/dL drop in haemoglobin. Despite stable vitals, repeat imaging showed increasing free fluid, and she elected for laparoscopic salpingectomy. Surgery revealed a slow-leaking tubal rupture that was not initially apparent.

ectopic_pregnancy_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Ruptured ectopic pregnancy in an adolescent
  presenting_complaint: Collapse and severe abdominal distension
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old girl with no known sexual history presented in extremis with concealed haemorrhage. A bedside scan revealed massive haemoperitoneum and a ruptured right tubal pregnancy. She underwent emergency surgery and received a massive transfusion protocol, followed by extensive multidisciplinary support for her age and trauma.

ectopic_pregnancy_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Ectopic pregnancy in a perimenopausal patient
  presenting_complaint: Irregular bleeding and bloating, thought to be menopause
  summary_of_course: A 49-year-old woman presented with what she believed were menopausal symptoms but had a positive pregnancy test. TVS showed a right tubal ectopic pregnancy with a fetal heartbeat. Given her age and lack of desire for future fertility, she underwent a bilateral salpingectomy and recovered well.

ectopic_pregnancy_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) evolving to ectopic
  presenting_complaint: Minimal spotting and low-grade pelvic ache
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old had serial hCG monitoring showing a suboptimal rise (40% in 48 hours) with no intrauterine sac on scan. On the fourth scan, a small mass was finally identified in the left tube. She was managed with expectant management as her hCG began to fall spontaneously, eventually reaching <5 IU/L.

ectopic_pregnancy_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent ectopic pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Left-sided pain, history of right salpingectomy
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old who previously lost her right tube to an ectopic pregnancy presented with a new pregnancy in the left tube. To preserve her remaining tube, she was treated with a laparoscopic salpingostomy rather than a salpingectomy. She was counselled regarding the high risk of recurrence and the need for future IVF.

ectopic_pregnancy_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Ruptured ectopic pregnancy with known Von Willebrand disease
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal pain and dizziness
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old with a known bleeding disorder presented with a ruptured tubal pregnancy. Management required close coordination with haematology for Factor VIII/VWF concentrate infusion prior to and during emergency laparoscopy. Despite the coagulopathy, the haemorrhage was controlled, and she was discharged after a five-day stay.

ectopic_pregnancy_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Ectopic pregnancy following tubal ligation
  presenting_complaint: New onset pelvic pain 5 years after sterilisation
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old who had previously undergone laparoscopic clip sterilisation presented with a positive pregnancy test and RIF pain. Imaging and subsequent surgery confirmed an ectopic pregnancy in the distal segment of the tube, distal to the sterilisation clip. The entire tube and clip were removed laparoscopically.

ectopic_pregnancy_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Bilateral tubal ectopic pregnancies
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral pelvic pain and 7 weeks amenorrhoea
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old following ovulation induction presented with significant pelvic discomfort. Laparoscopy revealed separate ectopic pregnancies in both the left and right fallopian tubes. She underwent bilateral salpingectomy, necessitating future IVF for any subsequent pregnancies.

ectopic_pregnancy_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Ruptured ectopic pregnancy in a renal transplant recipient
  presenting_complaint: Atypical abdominal pain and rising creatinine
  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old on immunosuppressants for a renal transplant presented with vague abdominal symptoms and a slight decline in graft function. A high index of suspicion led to the diagnosis of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Surgery was complicated by the pelvic location of the transplanted kidney, requiring a consultant-led laparotomy.

ectopic_pregnancy_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Rudimentary horn pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Severe, localized left-sided pain at 12 weeks gestation
  summary_of_course: A 23-year-old with a known unicornuate uterus presented with acute abdominal pain. Imaging showed a pregnancy in a non-communicating rudimentary horn which had begun to rupture. She underwent an emergency excision of the rudimentary horn and the attached fallopian tube to prevent further life-threatening haemorrhage.
