  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent lymphocytic meningitis (Mollaret's)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of headache, neck stiffness, and photophobia.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented with her fourth episode of aseptic meningitis in three years. CSF during the acute phase showed lymphocytic pleocytosis and was positive for HSV-2 via PCR. Between episodes, she is neurologically normal; she was commenced on daily suppressive valaciclovir to reduce the frequency of meningitic flares.

herpes_simplex_infection_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Herpes simplex hepatitis
  presenting_complaint: Fever and jaundice in a third-trimester pregnant patient.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old pregnant female presented with acute liver failure, characterized by markedly elevated transaminases (>5000 U/L) but relatively low bilirubin. Despite the absence of skin lesions, HSV hepatitis was suspected and confirmed by serum PCR.
