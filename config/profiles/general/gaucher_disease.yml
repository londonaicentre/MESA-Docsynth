gaucher_disease_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 1 Gaucher disease (non-neuronopathic)
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of splenomegaly and mild bruising.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male presented after a routine physical examination revealed an enlarged spleen. Investigations showed a platelet count of 115 x 10^9/L and mild splenomegaly on ultrasound. Bone marrow biopsy identified characteristic Gaucher cells, and enzyme assay confirmed low beta-glucosidase activity. He was commenced on enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with Imiglucerase, resulting in normalisation of platelet counts within 12 months.

gaucher_disease_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 2 Gaucher disease (acute neuronopathic)
  presenting_complaint: Poor feeding, stridor, and developmental regression.
  summary_of_course: A 6-month-old female infant presented with rapid neurological decline, retrocollis, and persistent strabismus. Clinical examination confirmed massive hepatosplenomegaly and hypertonicity. Genetic testing identified homozygous L444P mutations in the GBA1 gene. Despite supportive care in the paediatric ICU, the patient succumbed to respiratory failure at 11 months of age.

gaucher_disease_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 1 Gaucher disease with skeletal involvement
  presenting_complaint: Chronic bone pain and stunted growth.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy presented with persistent leg pain and height below the 3rd centile. Radiographs of the femora showed classic Erlenmeyer flask deformities and osteopenia. Diagnosis was confirmed via enzyme assay and GBA1 sequencing showing N370S/L444P compound heterozygosity. He was started on Velaglucerase alfa, leading to significant improvement in growth velocity and reduction in bone pain.

gaucher_disease_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 3 Gaucher disease (chronic neuronopathic)
  presenting_complaint: Slowing of eye movements and mild cognitive delay.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old female with known splenomegaly since childhood presented with horizontal supranuclear gaze palsy. Neurological assessment confirmed Type 3 phenotype (3b) with progressive kyphosis and mild ataxia. She is maintained on high-dose ERT to manage systemic symptoms, though neurological progression remains a challenge. Regular multidisciplinary reviews focus on spinal stability and educational support.

gaucher_disease_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Late-onset Type 1 Gaucher disease
  presenting_complaint: Pathological hip fracture and chronic fatigue.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female presented to the orthopaedic ward with a neck of femur fracture following a minor fall. Pre-operative bloods revealed unexplained anaemia (Hb 98g/L) and thrombocytopenia (85 x 10^9/L). Post-operative marrow aspirate unexpectedly showed Gaucher cells, later confirmed by enzyme analysis. She was started on low-dose ERT to improve bone mineral density and prevent further fractures.

gaucher_disease_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute splenic infarction in Type 1 Gaucher disease
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset severe left upper quadrant pain.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male with known Type 1 Gaucher disease presented acutely to A&E with pleuritic left-sided abdominal pain. CT imaging confirmed a large splenic infarct secondary to massive splenomegaly. He was managed conservatively with intravenous analgesia, hydration, and an increase in his ERT dosage. His symptoms resolved over two weeks without the need for emergency splenectomy.

gaucher_disease_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 1 Gaucher disease in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Worsening epistaxis and bruising at 28 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant female with Type 1 Gaucher disease experienced a significant drop in platelet count to 40 x 10^9/L during her third trimester. Her ERT dose was increased and closely monitored by a specialist haematology-obstetrics team. She underwent a successful elective caesarean section at 38 weeks with platelet support, delivering a healthy neonate without complications.

gaucher_disease_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 1 Gaucher disease with associated Parkinsonism
  presenting_complaint: Resting tremor and bradykinesia.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male, stable on ERT for Type 1 Gaucher disease for 20 years, developed progressive motor symptoms. Neurological evaluation confirmed a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, associated with his GBA1 mutation status. While ERT continues to control his systemic Gaucher symptoms, his Parkinsonism is managed separately with levodopa/carbidopa, showing a moderate response.

gaucher_disease_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Perinatal lethal Gaucher disease
  presenting_complaint: Hydrops fetalis and "collodion baby" skin appearance.
  summary_of_course: A neonate was born at 34 weeks gestation with severe skin ichthyosis, hepatosplenomegaly, and generalised oedema. Despite intensive neonatal resuscitation, the infant developed refractory respiratory distress and passed away within 48 hours. Post-mortem biochemical analysis and genetic testing confirmed the perinatal lethal form of Gaucher disease with profound enzyme deficiency.

gaucher_disease_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 1 Gaucher disease with ERT resistance
  presenting_complaint: Rising chitotriosidase levels and returning bone pain.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female on long-term Imiglucerase therapy showed biochemical evidence of treatment failure with rising Lyso-Gb3 levels. Screening for anti-drug antibodies was positive, explaining the loss of therapeutic efficacy. She was successfully transitioned to substrate reduction therapy (SRT) with Miglustat, which stabilised her haematological parameters and markers of disease activity.

gaucher_disease_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 3 Gaucher disease with myoclonic epilepsy
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent seizures and progressive gait instability.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with Type 3c Gaucher disease presented with worsening myoclonic jerks and cognitive decline. EEG showed generalised spike-wave discharges, and MRI revealed progressive cortical atrophy. Despite optimal ERT for systemic disease, his neurological status required the addition of multiple anti-epileptic medications and intensive neuro-rehabilitation.

gaucher_disease_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 1 Gaucher disease with pulmonary hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Progressive exertional dyspnoea and ankle oedema.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female with a history of childhood splenectomy for Gaucher disease presented with NYHA Class III heart failure symptoms. Echocardiography and right heart catheterisation confirmed severe pulmonary arterial hypertension. She was managed with a combination of high-dose ERT and targeted pulmonary vasodilators (Bosentan), requiring close monitoring in a specialist centre.

gaucher_disease_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute bone crisis in Type 1 Gaucher disease
  presenting_complaint: Severe, localised pain in the right thigh and fever.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy with Type 1 Gaucher disease presented with an acute skeletal crisis mimicking osteomyelitis. MRI demonstrated extensive bone marrow oedema in the femoral shaft without abscess formation. He was treated with bed rest, aggressive intravenous analgesia, and hyperhydration, with symptoms subsiding over ten days.

gaucher_disease_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 1 Gaucher disease with multiple comorbidities
  presenting_complaint: Routine monitoring in a patient with T2DM and CKD.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with Type 1 Gaucher disease, Type 2 diabetes, and Stage 3 chronic kidney disease required complex pharmacological management. Due to his renal impairment, SRT was contraindicated, and he remained on ERT. Management focused on balancing his Gaucher therapy with glycaemic control and cardiovascular risk reduction to prevent further systemic complications.

gaucher_disease_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic Type 1 Gaucher disease
  presenting_complaint: Diagnosis via family screening.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old female underwent genetic testing after her brother was diagnosed with Gaucher disease. Although she was clinically asymptomatic with normal blood counts and no organomegaly on MRI, she was confirmed to be homozygous for the N370S mutation. A "watch and wait" strategy was adopted with 12-monthly clinical and biochemical monitoring.

gaucher_disease_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Avascular necrosis (AVN) in Type 1 Gaucher disease
  presenting_complaint: Chronic, worsening right groin pain and limp.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male with Type 1 Gaucher disease presented with subacute hip pain that became refractory to simple analgesia. MRI confirmed Stage III avascular necrosis of the right femoral head. He underwent a total hip replacement with specialist anaesthetic planning; his ERT was optimised pre-operatively to ensure adequate haemostasis during surgery.

gaucher_disease_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Traumatic splenic rupture in Type 1 Gaucher disease
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal pain and hypotension following a minor RTA.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male with known massive splenomegaly due to untreated Gaucher disease was involved in a low-speed road traffic accident. He presented in haemorrhagic shock with signs of peritonitis; emergency laparotomy revealed a ruptured spleen. Following life-saving splenectomy, he was started on ERT and prophylactic antibiotics to mitigate the high risk of post-splenectomy sepsis.

gaucher_disease_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Gaucheroma (pseudotumour)
  presenting_complaint: Palpable pelvic mass and dull abdominal ache.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with Type 1 Gaucher disease presented with a new 6cm mass in the pelvis on CT, raising suspicion of lymphoma. A core needle biopsy was performed, revealing a dense collection of Gaucher cells (a Gaucheroma) rather than malignancy. The mass was monitored radiologically and remained stable while his ERT dose was adjusted.

gaucher_disease_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Type 1 Gaucher disease (Late Diagnosis)
  presenting_complaint: Extreme fatigue and massive abdominal distension.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female migrant presented with severe anaemia (Hb 72g/L) and a spleen palpable in the right iliac fossa. She had been symptomatic for years without access to specialist care. Following diagnosis of Type 1 Gaucher disease, she was prioritised for ERT, showing a dramatic reduction in organ volume and improvement in quality of life within 18 months.

gaucher_disease_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 1 Gaucher disease on SRT
  presenting_complaint: Transition from ERT to oral therapy.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male, tired of fortnightly infusions, requested a switch to oral medication. Pharmacogenetic testing confirmed he was a CYP2D6 extensive metaboliser, making him a suitable candidate for Eliglustat. He has remained stable on oral SRT for two years with consistent haematological parameters and no significant side effects.
