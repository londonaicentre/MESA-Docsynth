ventral_hernia_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Congenital umbilical hernia
  presenting_complaint: Persistent bulge at the umbilicus in a toddler.
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old male was referred to the paediatric surgical clinic with a 2cm umbilical protrusion noted since birth. The hernia was easily reducible and asymptomatic, but failed to close spontaneously as expected. Elective primary suture repair was performed under general anaesthetic, and the patient was discharged the same day with no complications.

ventral_hernia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Incarcerated incisional hernia
  presenting_complaint: Painful, non-reducible lump at a previous midline laparotomy scar.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female with a history of an emergency colectomy three years ago presented to A&E with acute abdominal pain and a firm lump. Clinical examination confirmed an incarcerated incisional hernia with no signs of bowel obstruction on CT. She underwent urgent open mesh repair, which revealed incarcerated omentum that was successfully reduced, leading to an uneventful recovery.

ventral_hernia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Strangulated paraumbilical hernia
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and skin discolouration over an umbilical lump.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with chronic COPD presented with a 6-hour history of absolute constipation and systemic toxicity. Examination revealed a tense, dusky paraumbilical hernia; emergency laparotomy confirmed strangulated small bowel requiring a 20cm resection and primary anastomosis. The abdominal wall was repaired with a biological mesh due to the contaminated field, and the patient required a 48-hour ICU stay for respiratory support.

ventral_hernia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Spigelian hernia
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent sharp pain in the left lower quadrant, worse on straining.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented with localized abdominal wall pain but no palpable mass on initial examination. An ultrasound scan identified a 1.5cm defect in the Spigelian fascia lateral to the rectus muscle containing pre-peritoneal fat. She underwent a laparoscopic pre-peritoneal mesh repair (TEP) as an outpatient procedure, resulting in complete resolution of her symptoms.

ventral_hernia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Epigastric hernia
  presenting_complaint: Small, hard, painful lump between the breastbone and navel.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male athlete noticed a tender nodule in the midline of his upper abdomen during weightlifting. Clinical examination identified a small epigastric hernia containing incarcerated extraperitoneal fat. Given the persistent pain during exercise, a primary tension-free suture repair was performed under local anaesthesia with sedation.

ventral_hernia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent incisional hernia with loss of domain
  presenting_complaint: Massive abdominal bulge and difficulty with mobility and breathing.
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old obese male (BMI 42) presented with a second recurrence of a midline incisional hernia following previous failed repairs. CT imaging showed a large defect with "loss of domain," where a significant portion of the viscera resided outside the abdominal cavity. He underwent a multidisciplinary "component separation" technique with sublay mesh reinforcement after a period of preoperative weight loss and respiratory optimization.

ventral_hernia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Ruptured umbilical hernia with ascites (Flood Syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Spontaneous leakage of clear fluid from an umbilical lump.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis and gross ascites presented with "Flood Syndrome" after his umbilical hernia skin ulcerated and began leaking ascitic fluid. This life-threatening presentation was managed with urgent paracentesis, intravenous antibiotics, and emergency surgical closure of the defect to prevent bacterial peritonitis. He was subsequently managed by the hepatology team for transplant evaluation.

ventral_hernia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Obstructed incisional hernia
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal distension, colicky pain, and failure to pass flatus.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female with a known incisional hernia from a previous hysterectomy presented with clinical signs of small bowel obstruction. Radiology confirmed a loop of ileum trapped within the hernial sac with proximal bowel dilatation. She underwent an emergency laparotomy, reduction of the viable bowel, and an onlay mesh repair, with a return of bowel function on postoperative day four.

ventral_hernia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Infected mesh following ventral hernia repair
  presenting_complaint: Chronic discharging sinus and redness at a previous surgical site.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male returned six months after an open ventral hernia repair with a persistent purulent discharge from his scar. Investigations including a CT scan and wound swabs confirmed a deep-seated mesh infection with Staphylococcus aureus. The patient required complete excision of the synthetic mesh and a delayed reconstruction of the abdominal wall once the infection had cleared.

ventral_hernia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Traumatic ventral hernia
  presenting_complaint: Bruising and a new bulge in the flank following a road traffic accident.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male was involved in a high-speed collision, sustaining a "seatbelt injury" to the lower abdomen. CT trauma series revealed a disruption of the lateral abdominal wall musculature without visceral injury, diagnostic of a traumatic ventral hernia. Due to the high risk of incarceration, he underwent early surgical exploration and primary repair of the muscular layers.

ventral_hernia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Parastomal hernia
  presenting_complaint: Bulge adjacent to a colostomy site causing appliance leakage.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male, three years post-abdominoperineal resection for rectal cancer, complained of increasing difficulty maintaining a seal on his stoma bag. Examination revealed a large parastomal hernia causing significant contour deformity. He underwent a laparoscopic Sugarbaker repair using a specialized composite mesh, which restored the abdominal profile and stoma function.

ventral_hernia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Divarication of recti with associated umbilical hernia
  presenting_complaint: Midline ridge appearing when rising from a lying position.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old postpartum female presented with a significant midline bulge and core weakness. Examination showed a 5cm divarication of the rectus abdominis muscles and a small, reducible umbilical hernia. She was initially managed with specialized physiotherapy, but eventually opted for a combined abdominoplasty and hernia repair due to persistent back pain and aesthetic concerns.

ventral_hernia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Trocar site incisional hernia
  presenting_complaint: Painful lump at a previous 12mm laparoscopic port site.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female presented four months after a laparoscopic cholecystectomy with a new lump at the umbilical port site. The hernia was found to contain incarcerated omentum on ultrasound. A simple primary suture closure of the fascial defect was performed under general anaesthesia, and the patient was discharged with no further issues.

ventral_hernia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic irreducible paraumbilical hernia
  presenting_complaint: Long-standing umbilical lump that no longer goes back in.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including heart failure and type 2 diabetes, had a large paraumbilical hernia for over a decade. Although irreducible, it remained asymptomatic without signs of obstruction or skin changes. Given his high surgical risk, a conservative management plan with a supportive abdominal binder was agreed upon during an outpatient consultation.

ventral_hernia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Incisional hernia with enterocutaneous fistula
  presenting_complaint: Faecal-stained drainage from an abdominal wall defect.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old female with a complex surgical history for Crohn's disease presented with an incisional hernia complicated by a spontaneous enterocutaneous fistula. Management involved long-term parenteral nutrition (TPN) and wound vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy to stabilize the skin. After six months, she underwent a complex abdominal wall reconstruction including fistula resection and biological mesh placement.

ventral_hernia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Richter's hernia (ventral)
  presenting_complaint: Localized pain and redness over a small abdominal lump without vomiting.
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old female presented with a small, tender epigastric lump. Despite the lack of obstructive symptoms, she was found to have a Richter's hernia, where only a portion of the bowel wall was strangulated within the defect. Emergency surgery was performed, necessitating a small wedge resection of the ischaemic antimesenteric border of the ileum and primary hernia repair.

ventral_hernia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Large ventral hernia in a transplant recipient
  presenting_complaint: Increasing abdominal bulge following a liver transplant.
  summary_of_course: A 49-year-old male developed a large incisional hernia at the site of his "Mercedes-Benz" incision post-liver transplant. The use of immunosuppressants had contributed to poor wound healing and fascial dehiscence. He was managed with a delayed repair using a non-absorbable sublay mesh once his steroid dose was tapered, with careful monitoring of his graft function.

ventral_hernia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Multiple "Swiss cheese" ventral hernias
  presenting_complaint: Several small lumps appearing along an old surgical scar.
  summary_of_course: A 56-year-old female presented with three distinct hernias along a previous midline incision. Preoperative CT confirmed a "Swiss cheese" pattern of fascial defects. A laparoscopic approach was chosen to cover all defects with a single large intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM), providing a comprehensive repair with minimal incisions.

ventral_hernia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Incarcerated epigastric hernia in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Acute, severe upper abdominal pain at 30 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant female presented with an acutely tender epigastric hernia that became irreducible as the uterus enlarged. Due to the severity of the pain and risk of strangulation, she underwent an urgent primary repair under general anaesthesia with obstetric monitoring. The pregnancy continued to term without further surgical complications.

ventral_hernia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Obstructed umbilical hernia in a frail elderly patient
  presenting_complaint: Nausea, abdominal distension, and a tender umbilical mass in a nursing home resident.
  summary_of_course: An 91-year-old female with advanced dementia and frailty presented with an obstructed umbilical hernia. Following a multidisciplinary discussion and consultation with her family regarding her poor physiological reserve, a decision for conservative, palliative management was made. She was kept comfortable with analgesia and antiemetics, and passed away peacefully three days later.
