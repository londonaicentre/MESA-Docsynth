chronic_inflammatory_demyelinating_polyneuropathy_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Classic Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Progressive bilateral leg weakness and difficulty climbing stairs over four months.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented with symmetrical proximal and distal muscle weakness and absent tendon reflexes. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) demonstrated significant conduction velocity slowing and prolonged distal latencies. Lumbar puncture revealed cytoalbuminologic dissociation with a CSF protein of 1.2 g/L. He responded well to a course of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and remains on maintenance therapy.

chronic_inflammatory_demyelinating_polyneuropathy_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Lewis-Sumner Syndrome (MADSAM)
  presenting_complaint: Asymmetric weakness and numbness in the right hand and left foot.
  summary_of_course: This 52-year-old female presented with a multifocal pattern of sensory and motor deficits. NCS confirmed multifocal acquired demyelinating sensory and motor neuropathy (MADSAM) with persistent conduction blocks in non-compression sites. Unlike classic CIDP, her symptoms were markedly asymmetric. She was commenced on oral prednisolone with significant improvement in her grip strength over six months.

chronic_inflammatory_demyelinating_polyneuropathy_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Frequent falls and a change in gait over eight weeks.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy presented with progressive difficulty running and climbing stairs. Examination showed a waddling gait, distal wasting, and global areflexia. MRI of the spine showed hypertrophy and enhancement of the cauda equina nerve roots. He was diagnosed with paediatric CIDP and achieved full remission following three cycles of IVIg and a tapering course of corticosteroids.

chronic_inflammatory_demyelinating_polyneuropathy_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Distal Acquired Demyelinating Symmetric Neuropathy (DADS)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive numbness and tingling in the feet and hands with mild unsteadiness.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male presented with predominantly distal sensory loss and sensory ataxia. Investigations identified an IgM monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS) and positive anti-MAG antibodies. NCS showed distal-predominant demyelination. His response to standard CIDP treatments was poor, necessitating a transition to Rituximab therapy.

chronic_inflammatory_demyelinating_polyneuropathy_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-onset Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (A-CIDP)
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive limb weakness following a respiratory infection.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female was initially diagnosed with Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) due to the acute presentation. However, she experienced multiple clinical relapses beyond the initial 8-week period. Repeat NCS and CSF analysis confirmed the diagnosis of A-CIDP. She is now managed with monthly IVIg to prevent further fluctuations.

chronic_inflammatory_demyelinating_polyneuropathy_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe CIDP with Respiratory Failure
  presenting_complaint: Global paralysis and shortness of breath.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with a history of hypertension presented with life-threatening quadriparesis and Type 2 respiratory failure. He required ICU admission and mechanical ventilation. Following five sessions of plasma exchange (PLEX) and high-dose methylprednisolone, he regained the ability to breathe independently. He was transferred to a neuro-rehabilitation unit for intensive physiotherapy.

chronic_inflammatory_demyelinating_polyneuropathy_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Pure Sensory CIDP
  presenting_complaint: Severe imbalance and "pins and needles" in all four limbs.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female presented with profound sensory ataxia and a positive Romberg's sign but preserved motor strength. Somatosensory evoked potentials and NCS confirmed demyelination in sensory pathways. CSF protein was elevated at 0.95 g/L. She reported significant improvement in her proprioception and walking stability after initiating IVIg.

chronic_inflammatory_demyelinating_polyneuropathy_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Persistent leg weakness despite multiple treatments.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male failed to respond to maximal doses of corticosteroids and repeated IVIg cycles. His condition continued to deteriorate, leading to wheelchair dependence. He was eventually commenced on Ciclosporin as a steroid-sparing agent. After twelve months of combined immunosuppression, he regained the ability to walk with a frame.

chronic_inflammatory_demyelinating_polyneuropathy_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Relapsing-Remitting CIDP
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of leg heaviness and hand numbness.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male experienced four distinct episodes of neurological deficit over five years, with partial recovery between events. Each relapse was characterised by demyelinating features on NCS and elevated CSF protein. He was stabilised on a maintenance regimen of subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIg), which reduced the frequency of relapses.

chronic_inflammatory_demyelinating_polyneuropathy_010:
  primary_diagnosis: CIDP Complicating Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
  presenting_complaint: Worsening walking difficulty in a patient with known diabetic neuropathy.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with long-standing diabetes presented with a rapid decline in mobility and new proximal weakness. While initially attributed to diabetic amyotrophy, NCS showed non-length dependent demyelination inconsistent with simple diabetes. He responded significantly to IVIg, confirming an overlying CIDP component.

chronic_inflammatory_demyelinating_polyneuropathy_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Pure Motor CIDP
  presenting_complaint: Progressive weakness in the arms and legs without any sensory changes.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented with symmetrical limb weakness and wasting but entirely normal sensory examination and testing. NCS showed motor conduction blocks and slowed velocities, while sensory nerve action potentials were preserved. He was treated with IVIg, as corticosteroids are often less effective or can worsen pure motor variants.

chronic_inflammatory_demyelinating_polyneuropathy_012:
  primary_diagnosis: HIV-Associated Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Progressive numbness and weakness in a patient recently diagnosed with HIV.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male presented with a subacute demyelinating polyneuropathy shortly after his HIV diagnosis. CSF analysis showed cytoalbuminologic dissociation, though with a mild pleocytosis (15 cells/uL) typical of HIV-related cases. His neurological symptoms improved significantly following the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and a short course of IVIg.

chronic_inflammatory_demyelinating_polyneuropathy_013:
  primary_diagnosis: CIDP in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly worsening gait and hand weakness during the third trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant female presented at 30 weeks gestation with progressive motor deficits. Due to the pregnancy, treatment options were carefully considered, and she was started on IVIg. She showed a good clinical response, allowing for a normal vaginal delivery, though she required a dose adjustment postpartum due to a brief flare.

chronic_inflammatory_demyelinating_polyneuropathy_014:
  primary_diagnosis: IgG4 Autoantibody-Positive CIDP (Anti-Contactin-1)
  presenting_complaint: Very aggressive onset of weakness, sensory ataxia, and a prominent tremor.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male presented with a rapidly progressive course and a fine action tremor. Serology was positive for IgG4 anti-contactin-1 (CNTN1) antibodies. His condition was poorly responsive to IVIg but showed a dramatic improvement following B-cell depletion therapy with Rituximab, which is the preferred treatment for this specific antibody-mediated variant.

chronic_inflammatory_demyelinating_polyneuropathy_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild, Stable CIDP
  presenting_complaint: Persistent mild tingling in the toes and slight difficulty with fine motor tasks.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female was diagnosed with CIDP based on NCS and CSF findings after six months of stable, mild symptoms. Given her minimal functional impairment, a "watch and wait" approach was initially adopted. She remains in the community with six-monthly neurology reviews and has not yet required systemic therapy.

chronic_inflammatory_demyelinating_polyneuropathy_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Focal CIDP
  presenting_complaint: Weakness and sensory loss isolated to the right leg.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male presented with symptoms localised to the distribution of the right lumbosacral plexus. MRI neurography revealed significant thickening and T2-hyperintensity of the right femoral and sciatic nerves. NCS confirmed focal demyelination. He was treated with a targeted course of corticosteroids, resulting in significant functional recovery of the affected limb.

chronic_inflammatory_demyelinating_polyneuropathy_017:
  primary_diagnosis: CIDP Secondary to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)
  presenting_complaint: Joint pain, malar rash, and progressive limb weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female with known SLE developed a progressive demyelinating polyneuropathy. Investigations confirmed CIDP occurring as a rare neurological manifestation of her underlying connective tissue disease. Management required an escalation of her immunosuppressive regimen, including Mycophenolate Mofetil, which successfully controlled both her SLE and CIDP symptoms.

chronic_inflammatory_demyelinating_polyneuropathy_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic CIDP with Severe Muscle Atrophy
  presenting_complaint: Long-standing immobility and severe wasting of the calf muscles.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female had lived with undiagnosed CIDP for over a decade. By the time of presentation, she had significant secondary axonal loss and muscle atrophy. While IVIg provided some stabilisation of her strength, her functional recovery was limited by the degree of permanent axonal damage and joint contractures.

chronic_inflammatory_demyelinating_polyneuropathy_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic CIDP Exacerbation
  presenting_complaint: Sudden loss of walking ability in a previously stable patient.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with well-controlled CIDP on maintenance IVIg developed a severe chest infection. Following the infection, his neurological status rapidly declined, representing an acute-on-chronic flare. He required an additional "loading dose" of IVIg and a temporary increase in oral prednisolone to return to his functional baseline.

chronic_inflammatory_demyelinating_polyneuropathy_020:
  primary_diagnosis: CIDP with Normal CSF Protein (Diagnostic Challenge)
  presenting_complaint: Classic progressive symmetrical weakness but atypical test results.
  summary_of_course: A 49-year-old female presented with a textbook clinical picture of CIDP. However, two separate lumbar punctures showed normal CSF protein levels (0.35 g/L). The diagnosis was eventually confirmed through serial NCS showing progressive demyelination and a positive response to a trial of IVIg, highlighting that normal CSF protein does not exclude the diagnosis.
