  primary_diagnosis: Subacute hypertensive heart failure in the elderly
  presenting_complaint: Confusion and "off legs"
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old female with cognitive impairment was brought to the hospital by family. Physical exam revealed bibasal crackles and a BP of 190/95 mmHg, suggesting heart failure was the primary driver of her delirium. Low-dose diuretics and amlodipine resulted in significant improvement in both physical and cognitive status.

hypertensive_heart_failure_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypertensive heart failure triggered by Atrial Fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations and acute breathlessness
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old female with chronic hypertension developed fast AF (ventricular rate 150 bpm), precipitating acute LV failure. The loss of atrial kick in a stiff, hypertrophied heart led to rapid pulmonary congestion. She was treated with rate control and diuresis, followed by elective DC cardioversion.
