  summary_of_course: A newborn male presented with three distinct 2cm areas of skin loss on the vertex of the scalp. Further examination revealed rocker-bottom feet and cryptorchidism. Investigations confirmed Trisomy 13 and EEG showed multifocal discharges; he was started on phenobarbital for neonatal seizures before transitioning to end-of-life care.

patau_syndrome_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Patau Syndrome (Long-term Survivor)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent pneumonia and dysphagia.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old female with mosaic Patau syndrome was admitted with aspiration pneumonia. She is non-verbal with profound learning disabilities and requires gastrostomy feeding. Treatment involved IV antibiotics and chest physiotherapy, with a discussion regarding her 'Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation' (DNACPR) status.

patau_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Patau Syndrome with Severe Hypotonia
  presenting_complaint: Poor suckling and lethargy.
  summary_of_course: A 5-day-old female with Trisomy 13 exhibited profound hypotonia and frequent apnoeic episodes. Nasogastric tube feeding was commenced, but the patient developed worsening bradycardia. Following parental consultation, the focus of care shifted to comfort, and she passed away peacefully at home on day 12.

  presenting_complaint: Persistent neonatal jaundice and pale stools.
  summary_of_course: A 6-week-old infant with Trisomy 13 and post-axial polydactyly presented with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. Investigation suggested biliary atresia, but given the poor neurological prognosis and severe VSD, a Kasai procedure was deemed inappropriate. Palliative management of pruritus and jaundice was initiated.

patau_syndrome_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Patau Syndrome with Diaphragmatic Hernia
  presenting_complaint: Scaphoid abdomen and severe respiratory distress at birth.
  summary_of_course: A neonate was born with a left-sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Rapid genetic screening via QF-PCR identified Trisomy 13.

  primary_diagnosis: Patau Syndrome with Hypothyroidism
  presenting_complaint: Prolonged jaundice and constipation.
  summary_of_course: A 4-month-old infant with mosaic Patau syndrome and a stable VSD presented with features of hypothyroidism. Thyroid function tests showed a TSH of 45 mU/L and low T4. Levothyroxine was commenced, resulting in improved alertness and feeding, though global developmental delay remained severe.

patau_syndrome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Patau Syndrome (Diagnostic Challenge)
  presenting_complaint: Atypical dysmorphism and cardiac murmur.
  summary_of_course: A neonate initially suspected of having Edwards syndrome (Trisomy 18) due to overlapping features like overlapping fingers and low-set ears. However, the presence of subtle microphthalmia and polydactyly prompted wider testing. Karyotype confirmed Trisomy 13, highlighting the phenotypic overlap between the two syndromes.

patau_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Patau Syndrome with Intractable Seizures
  presenting_complaint: Frequent tonic-clonic seizures.
  summary_of_course: A 2-month-old infant with Trisomy 13 was admitted to the paediatric ward with status epilepticus. Despite loading with levetiracetam and midazolam infusions, seizure control was poor due to underlying semi-lobar holoprosencephaly. The goals of care were reviewed with the parents, focusing on seizure suppression and quality of life.
