  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old female presented with acute respiratory distress following a recent influenza infection. CT thorax demonstrated multifocal consolidation with a 2cm abscess in the left upper lobe, and blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). She required paediatric ICU admission for oxygen support and responded well to intravenous flucloxacillin and rifampicin.

lung_abscess_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic lung abscess secondary to bronchial obstruction
  presenting_complaint: Persistent dry cough and progressive weight loss over two months
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male smoker presented with features suggesting malignancy, but CT imaging showed a 5cm abscess distal to an endobronchial lesion. Bronchoscopy confirmed a squamous cell carcinoma obstructing the right main bronchus with associated post-obstructive suppuration. Management involved long-term antibiotics and referral for palliative radiotherapy as he was unfit for surgical resection.

  primary_diagnosis: Multiple embolic lung abscesses
  presenting_complaint: Shivering, shortness of breath, and bilateral chest pain
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old intravenous drug user presented with sepsis and a new pansystolic murmur. Echocardiography confirmed tricuspid valve endocarditis, and CT thorax showed multiple peripheral cavitary nodules consistent with septic emboli. He was managed in the ICU with targeted intravenous vancomycin and gentamicin, showing slow radiological resolution over eight weeks.

  primary_diagnosis: Klebsiella lung abscess
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of high fever and "currant jelly" sputum
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with uncontrolled diabetes and chronic liver disease presented in septic shock. Sputum and blood cultures grew Klebsiella pneumoniae, and CT showed a large, multi-loculated abscess in the right upper lobe. Despite aggressive fluid resuscitation and meropenem therapy, he required percutaneous drainage of the abscess due to poor clinical response.

  primary_diagnosis: Aspiration lung abscess post-stroke
  presenting_complaint: Lethargy, low-grade fever, and increased secretions
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old female resident in a nursing home, three weeks post-ischaemic stroke with residual dysphagia, developed a new oxygen requirement. Chest X-ray showed a 3cm cavity in the superior segment of the right lower lobe, typical of aspiration. She was managed with a conservative approach using piperacillin/tazobactam and speech and language therapy input for safe swallow assessment.

  primary_diagnosis: Lung abscess secondary to foreign body aspiration
  presenting_complaint: Chronic barking cough and localised wheeze
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male with a history of epilepsy presented with a non-resolving right-sided pneumonia. CT thorax identified a dense opacity within the right lower lobe bronchus with a distal 4cm abscess. Rigid bronchoscopy successfully removed a piece of plastic toy aspirated during a seizure months prior, allowing the abscess to drain and heal with antibiotics.

  primary_diagnosis: Opportunistic lung abscess (Rhodococcus equi)
  presenting_complaint: Subacute cough, malaise, and drenching night sweats
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male with advanced HIV (CD4 count <50) presented with a slow-growing cavitary lesion in the left lung. Culture of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid grew Rhodococcus equi, an unusual pathogen typically associated with horses. He required a prolonged six-month combination of vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and rifampicin alongside the initiation of antiretroviral therapy.

lung_abscess_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Lemierre's syndrome with metastatic lung abscesses
  presenting_complaint: Severe sore throat followed by neck swelling and respiratory distress
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female presented with internal jugular vein thrombosis following a pharyngeal infection. She developed multiple bilateral lung abscesses due to septic emboli from Fusobacterium necrophorum. Management included anticoagulation for the thrombosis and a six-week course of high-dose intravenous metronidazole and benzylpenicillin.

lung_abscess_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Amoebic lung abscess
  presenting_complaint: Right upper quadrant pain and "anchovy paste" sputum
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male recently returned from a six-month stay in Southeast Asia presented with a liver abscess that had ruptured through the diaphragm into the right lung base. He expectorated characteristic reddish-brown sputum, and Entamoeba histolytica serology was positive. He was successfully treated with metronidazole followed by a luminal amoebicide (paromomycin).

  primary_diagnosis: Pulmonary Actinomycosis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic chest wall pain and a productive cough with yellow granules
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male with very poor dentition presented with a mass-like lesion on CXR that crossed anatomical fissures and involved the pleura. Sputum microscopy revealed "sulfur granules," and cultures confirmed Actinomyces israelii. He required a prolonged twelve-month course of penicillin G to ensure complete resolution of the indolent infection.

lung_abscess_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Lung abscess in Cystic Fibrosis
  presenting_complaint: Acute exacerbation of cough and significant drop in FEV1
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female with Cystic Fibrosis presented with a new 3cm abscess in the left lower lobe amidst chronic bronchiectatic changes. Sputum cultures grew multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia. She was treated with a combination of intravenous ceftazidime and tobramycin, alongside intensified chest physiotherapy and nutritional support.

  primary_diagnosis: Post-traumatic lung abscess
  presenting_complaint: Fever and purulent secretions from tracheostomy
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old male involved in a major road traffic accident sustained bilateral lung contusions and required prolonged mechanical ventilation. On day 14 of ICU admission, he developed a localized abscess within a resolving contusion in the left lung. He was treated with carbapenems and targeted weaning from the ventilator, with the abscess resolving over four weeks.

lung_abscess_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Lung abscess complicating pulmonary infarction
  presenting_complaint: Pleuritic pain and sudden onset of fever
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female with a recent large pulmonary embolism developed a secondary infection of the infarcted lung segment. CT showed a cavity forming within the wedge-shaped peripheral opacity in the right base. She required a combination of therapeutic anticoagulation and a prolonged course of broad-spectrum antibiotics to manage the infected infarct.

lung_abscess_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Nocardial lung abscess
  presenting_complaint: Headache, cough, and skin nodules
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male on long-term prednisolone for rheumatoid arthritis presented with a lung abscess and concurrent brain lesions. Biopsy of a skin nodule and BAL fluid grew Nocardia asteroides. He was treated with high-dose co-trimoxazole for twelve months, with close monitoring of renal function and bone marrow suppression.

lung_abscess_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Lung abscess in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Fever and cough following severe morning sickness
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female at 30 weeks gestation presented with an aspiration-related lung abscess after a period of protracted vomiting. To minimize radiation, a low-dose CT was used for diagnosis, showing a 4cm cavity in the right upper lobe. She was safely treated with intravenous clindamycin, avoiding tetracyclines and quinolones, and delivered a healthy infant at term.

lung_abscess_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory lung abscess requiring surgery
  presenting_complaint: Persistent fever and cough despite four weeks of IV antibiotics
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with a 6cm lung abscess in the left lower lobe failed to show radiological improvement despite appropriate antibiotic therapy and percutaneous drainage attempts. Due to the risk of rupture and persistent sepsis, he underwent a video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) lobectomy. Histopathology confirmed a chronic abscess with no evidence of underlying malignancy.

  primary_diagnosis: Melioidosis-related lung abscess
  presenting_complaint: Acute high fever, prostration, and cough
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male diabetic traveller returned from Northern Australia with severe pneumonia and multiple small lung abscesses. Cultures grew Burkholderia pseudomallei, confirming a diagnosis of melioidosis. He was treated with intensive intravenous ceftazidime for three weeks, followed by a three-month eradication phase with oral co-trimoxazole.
