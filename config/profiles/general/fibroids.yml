fibroids_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Intramural uterine fibroids
  presenting_complaint: Heavy menstrual bleeding and iron deficiency anaemia
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female presented with a 12-month history of menorrhagia and lethargy. Blood tests revealed a haemoglobin of 92g/L and low ferritin. Pelvic ultrasound confirmed three intramural fibroids, the largest measuring 5cm. She was started on oral iron supplements and a Mirena intrauterine system (IUS), resulting in significant reduction in menstrual flow and improvement in haematological parameters.

fibroids_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Subserosal uterine fibroid
  presenting_complaint: Increased urinary frequency and pelvic pressure
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old woman reported worsening urinary urgency and a sensation of pelvic fullness over six months. Physical examination revealed a firm, non-tender palpable mass equivalent to a 14-week gestation uterus. MRI imaging identified a large 10cm subserosal fibroid on the anterior uterine wall compressing the bladder. She underwent a successful laparoscopic myomectomy with complete resolution of urinary symptoms.

fibroids_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Red degeneration of fibroid
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset pelvic pain in pregnancy
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female, 22 weeks pregnant, presented to the maternity assessment unit with sudden, severe localised abdominal pain and low-grade pyrexia. Ultrasound showed a 6cm intramural fibroid with cystic changes consistent with red degeneration. She was managed conservatively with bed rest, intravenous fluids, and analgesia, allowing the pregnancy to continue to term without further complication.

fibroids_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Submucosal fibroid (Type 0)
  presenting_complaint: Primary infertility and intermenstrual bleeding
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old nulliparous woman presented with a two-year history of inability to conceive and spotting between periods. Hysterosalpingogram and subsequent hysteroscopy identified a 2cm pedunculated submucosal fibroid completely occupying the fundal cavity. She underwent hysteroscopic resection of the fibroid; she successfully conceived naturally six months post-procedure.

fibroids_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Pedunculated fibroid torsion
  presenting_complaint: Acute, sharp lower abdominal pain and vomiting
  summary_of_course: A 37-year-old female presented to A&E with acute-on-chronic pelvic pain and nausea. Clinical examination revealed guarding in the right iliac fossa. Emergency laparoscopy discovered a twisted pedunculated subserosal fibroid that had become ischaemic. The fibroid was removed, and the patient was discharged on day two post-operatively.

fibroids_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Multiple uterine leiomyomata
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal bloating and increased girth
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old perimenopausal woman presented with a "bulky" abdomen and clothes no longer fitting. Imaging revealed a multi-fibroid uterus extending to the level of the umbilicus, with the largest mass measuring 15cm. Due to the significant bulk symptoms and failed medical management with GnRH analogues, she elected for a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingectomy.

fibroids_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Prolapsed submucosal fibroid
  presenting_complaint: Vaginal mass and offensive discharge
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old woman presented with the sensation of a mass protruding from the vagina and persistent serosanguinous discharge. Examination under anaesthesia confirmed a 4cm submucosal fibroid prolapsing through the cervical os. The stalk was identified and divided vaginally, and histology confirmed a benign leiomyoma with surface ulceration.

fibroids_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Uterine fibroids with secondary hydronephrosis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic right-sided loin pain
  summary_of_course: A 46-year-old female with known fibroids presented with worsening flank pain. A CT urogram demonstrated moderate right-sided hydronephrosis caused by extrinsic compression of the ureter at the pelvic brim by a large lateral fibroid. She underwent uterine artery embolisation (UAE) to shrink the fibroid mass, which successfully relieved the ureteric obstruction.

fibroids_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Symptomatic fibroids in a postmenopausal patient
  presenting_complaint: New onset postmenopausal bleeding (PMB)
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old woman, five years post-menopause, presented with fresh vaginal bleeding. Transvaginal ultrasound showed a thickened endometrium and a 3cm submucosal fibroid. Following a pipelle biopsy and hysteroscopic resection to rule out malignancy, histology confirmed a benign leiomyoma with no evidence of atypia or sarcoma.

fibroids_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Uterine leiomyomata with acute haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Flooding and haemorrhagic shock
  summary_of_course: A 49-year-old female was brought to A&E via ambulance with massive vaginal bleeding and syncope. She was tachycardic (HR 125) and hypotensive (BP 88/50) with a haemoglobin of 58g/L. Following resuscitation with blood products and intravenous tranexamic acid, she underwent emergency uterine artery embolisation to control the haemorrhage caused by multiple bleeding fibroids.

fibroids_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Small asymptomatic fibroid
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding during routine screening
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old healthy female underwent a pelvic ultrasound for investigation of mild dysmenorrhoea. A single 1.5cm intramural fibroid was noted incidentally. As the patient was asymptomatic regarding bulk or heavy bleeding, a "watch and wait" approach was adopted with no immediate intervention required.

fibroids_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent uterine fibroids
  presenting_complaint: Return of heavy periods following previous myomectomy
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old woman who had a laparoscopic myomectomy four years prior presented with a recurrence of menorrhagia. Repeat ultrasound showed five new intramural fibroids ranging from 2cm to 4cm. Given her completed family size and desire to avoid further major surgery, she was successfully managed with a combination of tranexamic acid and hormonal suppression.

fibroids_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Fibroids with high-output heart failure
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath on exertion and palpitations
  summary_of_course: A 47-year-old female presented to cardiology with signs of heart failure. Investigations revealed severe chronic iron deficiency anaemia (Hb 42g/L) due to long-standing, neglected fibroid-related menorrhagia. After stabilisation with blood transfusions and iron infusions, she was referred to gynaecology for a definitive hysterectomy to treat the underlying cause.

fibroids_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Parasitic leiomyoma
  presenting_complaint: Vague abdominal discomfort and palpable mobile mass
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old woman, who had previously undergone a morcellation myomectomy, presented with a palpable mass in the left upper quadrant. Imaging and subsequent surgery revealed a 5cm parasitic fibroid attached to the omentum, likely seeded during her previous procedure. The mass was excised laparoscopically with no further recurrence.

fibroids_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Uterine fibroids in a patient on anticoagulation
  presenting_complaint: Life-threatening menorrhagia while on Apixaban
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old female on lifelong anticoagulation for a mechanical heart valve presented with uncontrollable menstrual flooding. Imaging showed a bulky fibroid uterus. Due to the high risk of stopping anticoagulation, she was treated with a GnRH agonist to induce amenorrhoea before undergoing a planned total laparoscopic hysterectomy under heparin cover.

fibroids_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Intravenous leiomyomatosis
  presenting_complaint: Pelvic pain and incidental finding of vascular extension
  summary_of_course: A 43-year-old woman with known fibroids underwent an MRI which unexpectedly showed a worm-like extension of leiomyoma tissue into the internal iliac veins. This rare case of intravenous leiomyomatosis required a multidisciplinary surgical approach involving gynaecology and vascular surgery for complete excision of the uterine mass and the intravenous extensions.

fibroids_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Cervical fibroid
  presenting_complaint: Dyspareunia and difficult cervical smear
  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old female reported deep dyspareunia and her GP was unable to visualise the cervix during a routine smear test. Examination revealed a 6cm firm mass arising from the posterior lip of the cervix. She underwent a complex myomectomy to remove the cervical fibroid, which preserved her fertility and resolved her symptoms.

fibroids_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-embolisation syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Fever, pain, and malaise following UAE
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old woman returned to the hospital three days after uterine artery embolisation (UAE) for fibroids with severe pelvic pain, low-grade fever, and nausea. Inflammatory markers were mildly elevated, but blood cultures were negative. She was diagnosed with post-embolisation syndrome and managed with aggressive analgesia and anti-inflammatories, with symptoms resolving after 48 hours.

fibroids_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Diffuse uterine leiomyomatosis
  presenting_complaint: Constant pelvic ache and severe dysmenorrhoea
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old woman presented with a globally enlarged uterus containing dozens of small, confluent fibroids throughout the myometrium. This diffuse leiomyomatosis made myomectomy technically impossible. She was managed with long-term GnRH analogues and add-back HRT to control symptoms while preserving the uterus for future reproductive options.

fibroids_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Fibroid-associated recurrent miscarriage
  presenting_complaint: Three consecutive first-trimester pregnancy losses
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old female underwent investigation for recurrent miscarriage. Saline infusion sonography revealed a 3cm type 1 submucosal fibroid distorting the endometrial cavity. Following hysteroscopic resection of the fibroid, she successfully carried her next pregnancy to term, delivering a healthy infant via spontaneous vaginal delivery.
