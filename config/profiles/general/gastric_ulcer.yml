He underwent a Graham patch omental repair and was managed post-operatively with IV antibiotics and PPIs.

gastric_ulcer_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic refractory gastric ulcer
  presenting_complaint: Persistent epigastric pain and 5kg weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male with a 6-month history of dull abdominal pain failed to respond to standard PPI therapy. Repeat OGD showed a non-healing 2cm ulcer on the posterior gastric wall; multiple biopsies were negative for malignancy but confirmed chronic inflammation. He was switched to high-dose twice-daily esomeprazole and underwent successful H. pylori rescue therapy with a bismuth-based quadruple regimen.

gastric_ulcer_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Gastric outlet obstruction secondary to chronic ulceration
  presenting_complaint: Projectile vomiting and early satiety
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old female with a history of recurrent gastric ulcers presented with persistent vomiting of undigested food. OGD and barium swallow confirmed cicatricial stenosis of the pyloric channel due to chronic scarring from a previous ulcer. She was managed with endoscopic balloon dilatation and long-term maintenance PPI therapy.

gastric_ulcer_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Stress-induced gastric ulceration
  presenting_complaint: Coffee-ground aspirate from nasogastric tube
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male in the ICU for multi-organ failure following major trauma developed coffee-ground drainage from his NG tube. Bedside OGD showed multiple shallow acute ulcers in the gastric fundus consistent with stress-related mucosal disease. He was treated with continuous IV pantoprazole infusion and his haemoglobin stabilised without the need for surgical intervention.

gastric_ulcer_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Gastric ulcer mimicking malignancy
  presenting_complaint: Epigastric fullness and iron deficiency anaemia
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male was referred for OGD after blood tests showed a microcytic anaemia (Hb 92g/L). Endoscopy revealed a large, irregular ulcer with heaped-up edges in the gastric body, highly suspicious for adenocarcinoma.

  primary_diagnosis: Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome (Gastrinoma)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent multiple peptic ulcers and chronic diarrhoea
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female presented with recurrent gastric and duodenal ulcers despite H. pylori eradication and PPI use. Fasting serum gastrin levels were found to be significantly elevated (>1000 pg/mL), and a secretin stimulation test was positive. A PET-CT scan identified a small neuroendocrine tumour in the pancreas, and her gastric ulcers were managed with high-dose PPIs until surgical resection.

gastric_ulcer_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric H. pylori-positive gastric ulcer
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent abdominal pain and refusal to eat
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy presented with a 3-month history of periumbilical pain that worsened after meals. OGD performed under general anaesthesia revealed a small gastric body ulcer and histological evidence of H. pylori infection. He was successfully treated with a paediatric-adjusted dose of amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and omeprazole.

gastric_ulcer_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Steroid-induced acute gastric ulcer
  presenting_complaint: Epigastric pain following high-dose prednisolone
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with an acute flare of rheumatoid arthritis was started on 40mg prednisolone daily. Within one week, she developed severe dyspepsia; OGD confirmed a fresh 8mm ulcer in the gastric antrum. The ulcer was attributed to the synergistic effect of steroids and her baseline low-dose aspirin, requiring the addition of a prophylactic PPI.

gastric_ulcer_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Giant gastric ulcer with posterior penetration
  presenting_complaint: Severe back pain and epigastric tenderness
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male presented with atypical back pain and weight loss. A CT abdomen revealed a large posterior gastric ulcer penetrating into the body of the pancreas. He was managed conservatively with nutritional support and IV PPIs, as he was a high-risk surgical candidate, and showed gradual healing on serial endoscopy.

gastric_ulcer_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Marginal gastric ulcer post-Roux-en-Y bypass
  presenting_complaint: Severe upper abdominal pain and nausea
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female who underwent bariatric surgery two years prior presented with persistent pain at the gastrojejunal anastomosis. OGD identified a marginal ulcer on the gastric side of the stoma, likely exacerbated by her continued smoking. She was treated with sucralfate suspension and high-dose PPIs, alongside a mandatory smoking cessation programme.

gastric_ulcer_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic gastric ulcer in the elderly
  presenting_complaint: Routine screening for occult blood in stool
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including dementia, was found to be faecal occult blood positive during a routine check. Despite having no gastrointestinal symptoms, OGD revealed a large, clean-based ulcer in the gastric fundus. The ulcer was managed with oral PPIs and the withdrawal of his prophylactic naproxen.

  primary_diagnosis: Alcohol-related acute erosive gastric ulcer
  presenting_complaint: Vomiting blood after heavy alcohol binge
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female presented to A&E with haematemesis following a weekend of heavy spirit consumption. OGD showed multiple acute erosions and a shallow 5mm gastric ulcer with adherent clot. She was treated with IV fluids and oral PPIs, and was referred to alcohol liaison services for further support.

gastric_ulcer_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Gastric ulcer secondary to uraemic gastropathy
  presenting_complaint: Nausea, hiccups, and epigastric discomfort
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on haemodialysis presented with worsening uraemic symptoms and dyspepsia. OGD showed diffuse gastric mucosal oedema and a moderate-sized ulcer in the body of the stomach. Management focused on optimising dialysis clearance and starting a renal-adjusted dose of famotidine as he was intolerant to PPIs.

gastric_ulcer_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent gastric ulcer due to PPI non-compliance
  presenting_complaint: Return of burning epigastric pain
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with a known history of peptic ulcer disease presented with a relapse of symptoms after stopping his medication three months ago. Repeat OGD showed a recurrent ulcer at the site of the previous scar in the antrum. Education on the importance of long-term acid suppression was provided, and he was restarted on maintenance omeprazole.

gastric_ulcer_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Gastric ulcer with iron deficiency anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath on exertion and pallor
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female presented to her GP with lethargy; bloods showed Hb 78g/L and ferritin 5ng/mL. OGD revealed a chronic-looking 1.5cm gastric ulcer which was biopsied to rule out malignancy. She was treated with IV iron isomaltoside and an 8-week course of PPI, with follow-up OGD confirming complete ulcer healing.

gastric_ulcer_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic gastric ulcer with melaena
  presenting_complaint: Sudden weakness and black stools
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with long-standing untreated indigestion presented with acute melaena. OGD showed a large chronic ulcer with a visible non-bleeding vessel (Forrest IIa) in the antrum. The vessel was treated with gold probe electrocoagulation, and the patient was started on high-dose IV PPI for 72 hours before transitioning to oral therapy.

gastric_ulcer_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Gastric ulcer in a patient on anticoagulation
  presenting_complaint: Epigastric pain and drop in haemoglobin
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male on apixaban for atrial fibrillation presented with a 2g/dL drop in haemoglobin over one month. OGD identified a 1cm gastric ulcer with a flat pigmented spot (Forrest IIc). His anticoagulation was temporarily held, and he was treated with a PPI; apixaban was later resumed with concurrent PPI cover to prevent further bleeding.
