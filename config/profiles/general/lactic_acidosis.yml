lactic_acidosis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Type A Lactic Acidosis secondary to Septic Shock
  presenting_complaint: Hypotension, confusion, and tachypnoea
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with a history of recurrent UTIs presented via ambulance with GCS 12, BP 85/50 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 28. Arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed pH 7.12, pCO2 3.1 kPa, and a lactate of 9.4 mmol/L. Despite aggressive fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum IV antibiotics in the ICU, she required noradrenaline for vasopressor support to manage profound metabolic acidosis.

lactic_acidosis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Metformin-Associated Lactic Acidosis (MALA)
  presenting_complaint: Nausea, vomiting, and progressive lethargy
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male with Type 2 Diabetes and CKD stage 3 developed acute kidney injury (AKI) following a bout of gastroenteritis. He continued taking his metformin 1g BD, leading to a profound lactic acidosis with pH 6.9 and lactate 14.2 mmol/L. He was treated with urgent continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVH) to clear the metformin and correct the acidaemia, with successful renal recovery.

lactic_acidosis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Type B Lactic Acidosis secondary to Haematological Malignancy
  presenting_complaint: Night sweats, weight loss, and generalised weakness
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male with newly diagnosed Burkitt lymphoma presented with subacute fatigue. Initial labs showed a persistent hyperlactataemia of 6.5 mmol/L despite normal perfusion and oxygenation (Warburg effect). He was commenced on chemotherapy with close monitoring for tumour lysis syndrome, and his lactate levels normalised as the tumour burden decreased.

lactic_acidosis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Lactic Acidosis following Grand Mal Seizure
  presenting_complaint: Post-ictal confusion and transient tachypnoea
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old female with known epilepsy was brought to A&E following a 5-minute tonic-clonic seizure. An ABG taken 15 minutes post-event showed a pH of 7.21 and a lactate of 11.5 mmol/L. Without specific intervention other than maintenance IV fluids, a repeat ABG 2 hours later showed a lactate of 1.8 mmol/L, confirming rapid clearance of exercise-induced lactic acid.

lactic_acidosis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Type A Lactic Acidosis secondary to Mesenteric Ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal pain out of proportion to clinical signs
  summary_of_course: A 76-year-old male with atrial fibrillation presented with sudden-onset periumbilical pain and haematochezia. Investigations revealed a pH of 7.25 and a rising lactate from 3.0 to 8.5 mmol/L over four hours. Emergency CT angiography confirmed an SMA occlusion; he underwent bowel resection for extensive necrotic ileum, requiring prolonged ICU support.

lactic_acidosis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Lactic Acidosis due to Mitochondrial Myopathy
  presenting_complaint: Exercise intolerance and progressive muscle weakness
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy with developmental delay and ophthalmoplegia was found to have a chronic, mild elevation of resting serum lactate (3.2–4.5 mmol/L). Genetic testing confirmed a mutation in mitochondrial DNA (MELAS syndrome). Management involves a "mitochondrial cocktail" of coenzyme Q10 and L-carnitine to optimise metabolic function and prevent acute decompensation.

lactic_acidosis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Type B Lactic Acidosis due to Thiamine Deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Dyspnoea and high-output heart failure
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with chronic alcohol dependence presented with tachycardia and peripheral oedema (wet beri-beri). Laboratory tests showed an unexplained lactate of 7.2 mmol/L with a normal anion gap. Following administration of high-dose IV Pabrinex (thiamine), the lactate level rapidly normalised within 12 hours, confirming thiamine deficiency as the cause of impaired aerobic metabolism.

lactic_acidosis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Linezolid-Induced Lactic Acidosis
  presenting_complaint: Vague abdominal discomfort and progressive shortness of breath
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female receiving a prolonged 6-week course of IV Linezolid for prosthetic joint MRSA infection developed subacute nausea. ABG showed a pH of 7.28 and lactate of 5.9 mmol/L with no evidence of sepsis or hypoperfusion. Linezolid was discontinued due to suspected mitochondrial toxicity, leading to complete resolution of the acidosis within 48 hours.

lactic_acidosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Lactic Acidosis secondary to Carbon Monoxide Poisoning
  presenting_complaint: Headache, dizziness, and altered mental status
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male was found unconscious in a flat with a faulty gas heater. He was cherry-red in appearance with an initial lactate of 6.8 mmol/L and carboxyhaemoglobin of 35%. He was treated with high-flow 100% oxygen and hyperbaric therapy, which improved tissue oxygen delivery and cleared the lactate.

lactic_acidosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Lactic Acidosis in Fulminant Hepatic Failure
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice and grade III hepatic encephalopathy
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female presented 48 hours after a paracetamol overdose (staggered). She was acidotic with pH 7.10, INR 6.5, and lactate 12.0 mmol/L, indicating failed hepatic clearance and systemic mitochondrial dysfunction. She was listed for emergency liver transplantation and required CVVH for metabolic control while awaiting a donor.

lactic_acidosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Propofol Infusion Syndrome (PRIS)
  presenting_complaint: Bradycardia and metabolic acidosis in an ICU patient
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male with a traumatic brain injury had been receiving high-dose propofol sedation for 5 days. He developed sudden-onset refractory lactic acidosis (lactate 9.2 mmol/L), rhabdomyolysis, and Brugada-like ECG changes. Propofol was immediately ceased and replaced with midazolam; his metabolic status improved following renal replacement therapy.

lactic_acidosis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: D-Lactic Acidosis secondary to Short Bowel Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Episodes of ataxia, slurred speech, and confusion after meals
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with a history of extensive small bowel resection for Crohn's disease presented with "drunken" behaviour despite no alcohol intake. Standard lactate assays were normal, but a specific D-lactate assay revealed a level of 5.5 mmol/L (normal <0.25). His symptoms improved with a low-carbohydrate diet and oral antibiotics to reduce colonic lactobacillus overgrowth.

lactic_acidosis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Type A Lactic Acidosis due to Cardiogenic Shock
  presenting_complaint: Crushing chest pain and cold, clammy peripheries
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male suffered an extensive anterior MI. On arrival, he was in cardiogenic shock with a BP of 70/40 mmHg and cold extremities; ABG showed a lactate of 8.8 mmol/L. Following emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) insertion, his cardiac output improved and lactate levels trended down.

lactic_acidosis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NRTI) Toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss, hepatomegaly, and fatigue
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old male on long-term antiretroviral therapy (Zidovudine-based) for HIV presented with subacute malaise. Lab work identified severe hepatic steatosis and a chronic Type B lactic acidosis (lactate 5.4 mmol/L) attributed to NRTI-induced mitochondrial DNA polymerase-gamma inhibition. The offending agent was switched to a modern integrase inhibitor, with gradual metabolic recovery.

lactic_acidosis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Lactic Acidosis secondary to Haemorrhagic Shock
  presenting_complaint: Haematemesis and syncope
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with known oesophageal varices presented with massive upper GI bleeding. He was tachycardic (HR 130) and hypotensive (BP 75/40), with an initial lactate of 10.2 mmol/L and Hb 52 g/L. Rapid transfusion of blood products and endoscopic banding led to haemostasis, with lactate normalising as oxygen delivery was restored.

lactic_acidosis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Lactic Acidosis in Salicylate Poisoning
  presenting_complaint: Tinnitus, vomiting, and hyperventilation
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female presented 6 hours after ingesting 20g of Aspirin. ABG showed a mixed respiratory alkalosis and high anion gap metabolic acidosis with a lactate of 4.8 mmol/L due to uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Treatment included urinary alkalinisation and a single session of haemodialysis for a salicylate level of 800 mg/L.

lactic_acidosis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Type B Lactic Acidosis secondary to Pheochromocytoma
  presenting_complaint: Paroxysmal hypertension, palpitations, and diaphoresis
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female was admitted for investigation of hypertensive crisis. During an episode, her lactate rose to 6.2 mmol/L despite no signs of shock, likely due to catecholamine-induced calorigenesis and peripheral vasoconstriction. CT adrenals confirmed a 4cm mass, and lactate levels remained normal following alpha-blockade and surgical resection.

lactic_acidosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic Lactic Acidosis from Nitroprusside Infusion
  presenting_complaint: Confusion and almond-smelling breath
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male was treated with high-dose sodium nitroprusside for a hypertensive emergency. He developed unexplained metabolic acidosis (pH 7.22, lactate 7.5 mmol/L) and declining GCS. Cyanide toxicity was suspected; the infusion was stopped, and he was treated with hydroxocobalamin, resulting in rapid clinical and biochemical improvement.

lactic_acidosis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Lactic Acidosis in Beta-Agonist Overdose
  presenting_complaint: Tremor, tachycardia, and palpitations
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male with asthma used his salbutamol inhaler excessively (over 50 puffs) during an exacerbation. He presented with a heart rate of 140 bpm and a potassium of 2.8 mmol/L; ABG showed a lactate of 5.1 mmol/L. The lactic acidosis was attributed to beta-2 mediated stimulation of glycolysis and resolved without specific treatment within 8 hours.

lactic_acidosis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Lactic Acidosis secondary to Ethylene Glycol Poisoning
  presenting_complaint: Inebriation, vomiting, and decreased urine output
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male was found in a confused state with an empty bottle of antifreeze. Lab tests showed a massive anion gap, an osmolar gap, and a "lactate" of 15 mmol/L on a point-of-care device (due to glycolate interference/lactate gap). He was treated with Fomepizole and urgent haemodialysis to prevent oxalate crystal-induced renal failure.
