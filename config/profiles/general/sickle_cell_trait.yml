sickle_cell_trait_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Sickle cell trait (incidental finding)
  presenting_complaint: Routine neonatal screening result.
  summary_of_course: A healthy 2-week-old male infant of Afro-Caribbean heritage was identified as having an HbAS pattern on routine newborn blood spot screening. Clinical examination was unremarkable with no signs of anaemia or jaundice. Parents were provided with genetic counselling regarding the carrier status and the implications for future pregnancies.

sickle_cell_trait_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Splenic infarction associated with sickle cell trait
  presenting_complaint: Acute left upper quadrant abdominal pain and pleuritic chest pain.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male presented after a high-altitude hiking trip at 3,500 metres. CT abdomen revealed a wedge-shaped peripheral splenic infarct; Hb electrophoresis confirmed sickle cell trait (HbS 38%). He was managed conservatively with hydration, analgesia, and oxygen, resulting in full resolution of symptoms.

sickle_cell_trait_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Exertional rhabdomyolysis in sickle cell trait
  presenting_complaint: Severe muscle pain, weakness, and dark urine following intense physical training.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old military recruit collapsed during a 10km run in hot conditions. Investigations showed a CK of 45,000 U/L and myoglobinuria; sickle cell solubility test was positive with HbAS confirmed later. He required aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation in the ITU to prevent acute kidney injury and made a full recovery.

sickle_cell_trait_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Renal papillary necrosis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent painless macroscopic haematuria.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old woman with known sickle cell trait presented with three episodes of frank haematuria over two months. Cystoscopy was normal, but CT urogram demonstrated sloughing of the renal papillae. She was treated with oral hydration and bed rest, with cessation of bleeding and preservation of renal function.

sickle_cell_trait_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Renal medullary carcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Right-sided loin pain, weight loss, and haematuria.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male with sickle cell trait presented with a 3-month history of constitutional symptoms. Imaging revealed a 6cm infiltrative mass in the right kidney with hilar lymphadenopathy, confirmed as renal medullary carcinoma on biopsy. Despite radical nephrectomy and systemic chemotherapy, the disease was aggressive with a poor prognosis.

sickle_cell_trait_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Sickle cell trait with secondary glaucoma
  presenting_complaint: Painful red eye and blurred vision following blunt trauma.
  summary_of_course: An 11-year-old boy presented with a traumatic hyphema after being hit by a ball. Despite a small hyphema, intraocular pressure (IOP) rose acutely to 40 mmHg; sickle cell trait was diagnosed during workup. Standard carbonic anhydrase inhibitors were avoided to prevent sickling in the anterior chamber, and he required surgical washout to control IOP.

sickle_cell_trait_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Hyposthenuria related to sickle cell trait
  presenting_complaint: Chronic polyuria and nocturia.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male with HbAS presented with persistent thirst and frequent urination. Water deprivation testing confirmed an inability to concentrate urine beyond 400 mOsm/kg, consistent with sickle cell trait-induced vasa recta damage. He was managed with advice on maintaining high fluid intake, especially in warm weather.

sickle_cell_trait_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Sickle cell trait (pre-operative identification)
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic; identified during pre-operative assessment.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old woman scheduled for elective cholecystectomy underwent routine screening due to her family history. Hb electrophoresis confirmed HbAS (HbS 35%). The anaesthetic plan was modified to ensure meticulous oxygenation, avoidance of acidosis, and maintenance of normothermia throughout the perioperative period.

sickle_cell_trait_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy with sickle cell trait
  presenting_complaint: Fever, rigors, and right-sided flank pain at 24 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old pregnant woman with known sickle cell trait presented with systemic sepsis. Urine culture grew E. coli, and she was treated with IV cefuroxime. Patients with SCT have an increased risk of UTIs in pregnancy, so she was placed on prophylactic antibiotics for the remainder of the gestation.

sickle_cell_trait_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Sickle cell trait with iron deficiency anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Lethargy and shortness of breath on exertion.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old woman with known SCT presented with microcytic anaemia (Hb 92 g/L, MCV 74 fL). While SCT usually presents with normal blood counts, her ferritin was 8 ug/L, indicating concomitant iron deficiency from heavy menses. Iron supplementation restored her Hb to her baseline of 125 g/L.

sickle_cell_trait_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Splenic sequestration mimic in sickle cell trait
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset left-sided abdominal fullness and dizziness.
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old male with HbAS and hereditary spherocytosis presented with acute splenomegaly and a drop in Hb from 110 to 70 g/L. This rare co-inheritance caused a clinical picture resembling sickle cell disease. He required a top-up blood transfusion and was later scheduled for an elective splenectomy.

sickle_cell_trait_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Sickle cell trait with exercise-induced collapse
  presenting_complaint: Sudden collapse and loss of consciousness during a marathon.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male runner with undiagnosed SCT collapsed at mile 22. He was found to be severely dehydrated with metabolic acidosis and evidence of intravascular sickling on a peripheral blood film. Following intensive fluid resuscitation and electrolyte correction, he recovered without permanent organ damage.

sickle_cell_trait_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic kidney disease (Stage 3a) secondary to sickle cell trait
  presenting_complaint: Routine monitoring of hypertension.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with long-standing SCT was found to have a declining eGFR (45 mL/min/1.73m²) and persistent albuminuria. Extensive workup excluded other causes of nephropathy, attributing the decline to chronic sickling-induced micro-infarctions in the renal medulla. He was started on an ACE inhibitor for renal protection.

sickle_cell_trait_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Sickle cell trait with stuttering priapism
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent, painful, semi-erect penile episodes.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male with HbAS reported multiple episodes of painful erections lasting 2-3 hours, typically occurring in the early morning. While rare in SCT, other triggers were excluded, and he was managed with pseudoephedrine and referred to urology. The frequency of episodes decreased with improved hydration and avoidance of triggers.

sickle_cell_trait_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute chest syndrome mimic in sickle cell trait
  presenting_complaint: Pleuritic chest pain and hypoxia following severe pneumonia.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with SCT was admitted with multi-lobar bacterial pneumonia. His oxygen saturations dropped to 88% on room air, and a peripheral film showed occasional sickle cells, suggesting localized sickling due to hypoxia and acidosis. He was treated with high-flow oxygen, IV antibiotics, and cautious fluid balance, avoiding the need for exchange transfusion.

sickle_cell_trait_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Venous thromboembolism (Pulmonary Embolism)
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset pleuritic chest pain and haemoptysis.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old woman with SCT presented with a segmental pulmonary embolism confirmed by CTPA. She had no other risk factors such as oral contraceptive use or recent surgery. She was commenced on rivaroxaban for six months, with a discussion regarding the slightly increased baseline VTE risk associated with HbAS.

sickle_cell_trait_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Sickle cell trait (Genetic Counselling)
  presenting_complaint: Partner of a known Sickle Cell Anaemia (HbSS) patient.
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old male sought screening as his partner has HbSS. Testing confirmed he has sickle cell trait (HbAS). They were counselled by a haemoglobinopathy nurse that there is a 50% chance of each child having sickle cell anaemia (HbSS) and a 50% chance of sickle cell trait (HbAS).

sickle_cell_trait_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Sickle cell trait with hyperpnoea-induced sickling
  presenting_complaint: Severe limb pain and paraesthesia after hyperventilation.
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old female with SCT experienced a severe panic attack leading to prolonged hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis. This physiological stress triggered a vaso-occlusive-like pain crisis in her legs. Symptoms resolved with rebreathing techniques, oral hydration, and simple analgesia.

sickle_cell_trait_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Haemorrhagic cystitis mimic
  presenting_complaint: Dysuria and gross haematuria.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old girl with SCT presented with what appeared to be severe cystitis, but urine cultures were persistently negative. Flexible cystoscopy revealed focal areas of submucosal haemorrhage in the bladder trigone, thought to be related to microvascular sickling. Symptoms were managed with increased fluid intake and resolved over one week.

sickle_cell_trait_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Sickle cell trait (Blood donor screening)
  presenting_complaint: Notification from blood transfusion service.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old regular blood donor was notified that his blood tested positive for HbS during routine screening. He was asymptomatic with a normal full blood count. He was advised that while he can still donate, his blood cannot be used for intra-uterine transfusions or for patients with sickle cell disease.
