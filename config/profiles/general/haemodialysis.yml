  presenting_complaint: Orthopnoea and peripheral oedema despite high-dose diuretics
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with ischaemic cardiomyopathy and worsening renal function. He was admitted with pulmonary oedema unresponsive to furosemide infusions. Haemodialysis with isolated ultrafiltration was initiated to remove 4 litres of fluid over 48 hours, significantly improving his respiratory status.

haemodialysis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Pregnancy in ESRD
  presenting_complaint: Management of uraemia during the second trimester
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female on HD became pregnant. To ensure foetal viability and reduce the risk of polyhydramnios, her HD prescription was increased to 6 sessions per week (total 24 hours) to maintain a pre-dialysis urea below 15 mmol/L. She successfully delivered a healthy but premature infant at 32 weeks.

haemodialysis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Dialysis-related amyloidosis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic shoulder pain and bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome
  summary_of_course: A 71-year-old male who has been on haemodialysis for 25 years. Imaging and biopsy confirmed beta-2 microglobulin amyloid deposits. His treatment was switched to high-volume online haemodiafiltration (HDF) to improve the clearance of middle-sized molecules and alleviate symptoms.

haemodialysis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Tumour Lysis Syndrome (TLS)
  presenting_complaint: Oliguria following first cycle of chemotherapy for Burkitt lymphoma
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male developed hyperuricaemia (1.2 mmol/L) and hyperphosphataemia (3.1 mmol/L) shortly after starting treatment. Despite rasburicase, his creatinine rose sharply.
