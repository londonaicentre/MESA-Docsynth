  primary_diagnosis: Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent epistaxis, haematuria, and mild haemoptysis.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male presented with a multisystem illness including crusting nasal sores and worsening renal function. Serology was strongly c-ANCA positive, and a renal biopsy showed necrotising glomerulonephritis. He was treated with high-dose corticosteroids and rituximab, which halted the pulmonary and renal progression.

haemoptysis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic Anticoagulation Toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Spontaneous bruising and several episodes of blood-stained sputum.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male on long-term warfarin for atrial fibrillation presented with an INR of 9.2 following a course of erythromycin. He had no focal lung pathology on imaging. The coagulopathy was reversed with intravenous Vitamin K and prothrombin complex concentrate, and his haemoptysis ceased immediately.

haemoptysis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Foreign Body Aspiration
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of choking followed by a persistent cough and blood-streaked mucus.
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old girl was brought to the paediatric ED after playing with small toys. Physical exam revealed localised wheeze on the right side, and a chest X-ray showed right-sided hyperinflation. Rigid bronchoscopy under general anaesthesia successfully removed a plastic bead from the right main bronchus, resolving the symptoms.

haemoptysis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Goodpasture Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Severe haemoptysis and rapidly progressive oliguric renal failure.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male smoker presented with life-threatening pulmonary haemorrhage requiring mechanical ventilation. Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies. Despite aggressive treatment with plasmapheresis and immunosuppression, he remained dialysis-dependent but his pulmonary symptoms resolved.

haemoptysis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Cystic Fibrosis related Haemoptysis
  presenting_complaint: Acute-on-chronic cough with 200ml of bright red blood.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with known cystic fibrosis presented with a significant pulmonary haemorrhage. Despite initial management with tranexamic acid and antibiotics, the bleeding persisted. He underwent successful selective bronchial artery embolisation of a tortuous bronchial artery, which controlled the bleeding.

haemoptysis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent epistaxis and occasional mild haemoptysis since adolescence.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female with a family history of HHT presented for evaluation of exertional dyspnoea. Contrast echocardiography and CTPA revealed multiple pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). She underwent elective percutaneous coil embolisation of the largest AVMs to prevent future paradoxical emboli and haemorrhage.

  primary_diagnosis: Acute Viral Bronchitis
  presenting_complaint: Five-day history of URTI symptoms followed by cough with small specks of blood.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old previously healthy female presented concerned about blood in her phlegm. Clinical examination and chest X-ray were entirely normal, and she was haemodynamically stable. She was diagnosed with acute bronchitis, managed conservatively with simple analgesia, and the haemoptysis resolved spontaneously within 48 hours.

  primary_diagnosis: Lung Abscess
  presenting_complaint: Fever, pleuritic pain, and foul-smelling sputum mixed with blood.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol dependency and poor dental hygiene presented with a subacute illness. Chest X-ray showed a thick-walled cavity with an air-fluid level in the right lower lobe. He was treated with a prolonged six-week course of intravenous and then oral clindamycin, resulting in clinical and radiological resolution.

  primary_diagnosis: Catamenial Haemoptysis
  presenting_complaint: Monthly episodes of mild haemoptysis occurring during menstruation.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female presented with a two-year history of cyclical haemoptysis. Extensive pulmonary investigations including CT and bronchoscopy were normal when performed mid-cycle. A diagnosis of thoracic endometriosis was made based on the clinical timing, and her symptoms were successfully suppressed using a GnRH agonist.

  primary_diagnosis: Behçet's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent oral and genital ulcers followed by sudden, massive haemoptysis.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male of Mediterranean descent presented with a life-threatening pulmonary haemorrhage. CT imaging revealed multiple pulmonary artery aneurysms. He was treated with high-dose methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide, which led to a gradual regression of the aneurysms and cessation of bleeding.

haemoptysis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Pulmonary Hydatid Cyst
  presenting_complaint: Cough, mild haemoptysis, and the expectoration of "salty" fluid.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male sheep farmer from Wales presented with a chronic cough. Imaging identified a large, well-circumscribed cystic lesion in the left lung with a "water lily sign." Serology confirmed Echinococcus granulosus infection, and he underwent surgical cystectomy combined with albendazole therapy.

haemoptysis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
  presenting_complaint: Dull, persistent chest pain, weight loss, and occasional blood-streaked sputum.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male former shipyard worker presented with progressive breathlessness. Imaging showed a large pleural effusion and nodular pleural thickening. Pleural biopsy confirmed epithelioid mesothelioma, and the mild haemoptysis was attributed to local invasion of the lung parenchyma.

haemoptysis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Tracheoinnominate Artery Fistula
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, torrential haemorrhage from a tracheostomy site.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male in the ICU, two weeks post-prolonged intubation and tracheostomy, experienced a "sentinel" bleed followed by massive haemorrhage. Despite emergency digital compression of the artery against the sternum and attempted surgical repair, the patient unfortunately succumbed to cardiovascular collapse.
