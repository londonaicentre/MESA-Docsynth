had_endoscopic_therapy_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Gastric Antral Vascular Ectasia (GAVE)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic iron deficiency anaemia and occult blood loss
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old female with systemic sclerosis required repeated blood transfusions for "watermelon stomach." She underwent multiple sessions of Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) to the gastric antrum. This endoscopic therapy successfully stabilised her haemoglobin levels and reduced her transfusion requirements.

had_endoscopic_therapy_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Barrett's Oesophagus with High-Grade Dysplasia
  presenting_complaint: Surveillance for known Barrett's
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with a 10-year history of GORD and Barrett's was found to have high-grade dysplasia on biopsy. He underwent Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) using the Halo system. Three sessions of endoscopic therapy were required to achieve complete eradication of the dysplastic intestinal metaplasia.

had_endoscopic_therapy_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Dieulafoy Lesion
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, massive haematemesis
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with no significant PMH presented in hypovolaemic shock. Initial OGD was challenging due to blood volume, but a repeat procedure identified a protruding vessel in the proximal stomach without an associated ulcer. Endoscopic therapy with a mechanical "over-the-scope" clip (Ovesco) successfully controlled the arterial haemorrhage.

had_endoscopic_therapy_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Calcific Pancreatitis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent epigastric pain and steatorrhoea
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with chronic pancreatitis developed a symptomatic 8cm pancreatic pseudocyst. Endoscopic therapy was performed using EUS-guided transmural drainage. A Lumen-Apposing Metal Stent (LAMS) was placed between the stomach and the cyst, allowing for internal drainage and resolution of the collection.

had_endoscopic_therapy_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Diverticular Haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Brisk haematochezia and syncope
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old male with multiple comorbidities presented with lower GI bleeding. Colonoscopy identified active bleeding from a diverticulum in the sigmoid colon. Endoscopic therapy was delivered using "indirect" clipping (the "zip" technique) and dilute adrenaline, which successfully avoided the need for high-risk mesenteric embolisation.

had_endoscopic_therapy_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Benign Oesophageal Stricture
  presenting_complaint: Dysphagia to solid food (bread and meat)
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female with a history of severe reflux presented with a 5mm peptic stricture in the distal oesophagus. She underwent serial endoscopic therapy with through-the-scope (TTS) balloon dilatation. The lumen was gradually increased to 15mm over three sessions, resulting in the resolution of her dysphagia.

had_endoscopic_therapy_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Early Gastric Cancer (T1a)
  presenting_complaint: Epigastric fullness and dyspepsia
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male of Japanese descent was diagnosed with a 15mm well-differentiated adenocarcinoma confined to the mucosa. He underwent Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD), allowing for an en-bloc resection of the lesion. Histopathology confirmed clear margins, precluding the need for a formal gastrectomy.

had_endoscopic_therapy_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Zenker’s Diverticulum
  presenting_complaint: Regurgitation of undigested food and halitosis
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old male presented with a 4cm pharyngeal pouch. Endoscopic therapy was performed using a flexible endoscope and a diverticulotome (Staple-assisted or Dohlman procedure). The septum between the pouch and the oesophagus was divided, allowing food to pass normally and resolving his symptoms of aspiration.

had_endoscopic_therapy_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Radiation Proctitis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent rectal bleeding following prostate radiotherapy
  summary_of_course: A 73-year-old male presented with bothersome rectal bleeding two years after radiotherapy. Flexible sigmoidoscopy showed friable telangiectasia. He received endoscopic therapy with Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) at 1.0 L/min, which significantly reduced the frequency and volume of bleeding over two outpatient sessions.

had_endoscopic_therapy_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Tracheobronchial Mucous Plugging
  presenting_complaint: Acute respiratory distress and lobar collapse
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old ICU patient with severe pneumonia and failing mechanical ventilation showed complete left lung collapse on CXR. Therapeutic flexible bronchoscopy was performed to remove thick, tenacious secretions. Following the endoscopic therapy, the airway was cleared, and oxygenation parameters improved immediately.

had_endoscopic_therapy_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Anastomotic Leak (Post-Oesophagectomy)
  presenting_complaint: Sepsis and mediastinal collection on CT
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male developed a small 5mm leak at the gastro-oesophageal anastomosis on day 7 post-op. Instead of re-operation, he underwent endoscopic therapy with the placement of a fully covered oesophageal metal stent. This bypassed the leak, allowing for enteral nutrition and successful healing of the anastomosis.

had_endoscopic_therapy_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Bleeding Gastric Antral Ulcer (Refractory)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent haematemesis despite previous intervention
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male had re-bleeding 24 hours after initial clipping of a duodenal ulcer. During the repeat OGD, the bleeding was diffuse and difficult to target. Endoscopic therapy with Haemospray (a haemostatic powder) was applied as a rescue therapy, achieving immediate temporary haemostasis until definitive surgical review.

had_endoscopic_therapy_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Obstructing Endobronchial Tumour
  presenting_complaint: Persistent cough and stridor
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old female with squamous cell lung carcinoma presented with severe airway narrowing.
