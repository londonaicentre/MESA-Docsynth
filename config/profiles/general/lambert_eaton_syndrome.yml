lambert_eaton_syndrome_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Progressive proximal muscle weakness and dry mouth.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male smoker presented with a 3-month history of difficulty rising from chairs and a persistent dry mouth. Neurological examination revealed diminished tendon reflexes that improved after brief maximal isometric contraction. Investigations confirmed P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) antibodies and a subsequent CT chest identified a small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC).

lambert_eaton_syndrome_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Non-paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Chronic leg fatigue and gait instability.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female presented to the neurology clinic with a 2-year history of "heavy legs" and frequent stumbles. Repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) showed a low-amplitude compound muscle action potential (CMAP) with 150% facilitation post-exercise. She was diagnosed with idiopathic LEMS, started on amifampridine (3,4-diaminopyridine), and remains stable with no evidence of malignancy on serial imaging.

lambert_eaton_syndrome_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty running and frequent falls.
  summary_of_course: An 11-year-old girl with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus presented with subacute onset of proximal lower limb weakness. Initial suspicion of inflammatory myopathy was ruled out by normal creatine kinase levels and positive VGCC antibodies. She responded well to a combination of pyridostigmine and low-dose prednisolone, showing significant improvement in her mobility.

lambert_eaton_syndrome_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe LEMS with Respiratory Failure
  presenting_complaint: Acute shortness of breath and generalised weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male was admitted to the ICU with Type 2 respiratory failure following a minor upper respiratory tract infection. He had a background of undiagnosed progressive weakness; electrodiagnostic testing in the unit confirmed LEMS with significant decrement at low-frequency stimulation. He required intubation and was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and plasma exchange before transitioning to oral amifampridine.

lambert_eaton_syndrome_005:
  primary_diagnosis: LEMS misdiagnosed as Lumbar Stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral leg weakness and lower back discomfort.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old female underwent unsuccessful spinal decompression surgery for suspected lumbar stenosis before LEMS was considered. Post-operative lack of improvement led to a neurology review where absent ankle jerks and post-exercise potentiation were noted. VGCC antibody titres were high, and she achieved significant functional gains once started on amifampridine.

lambert_eaton_syndrome_006:
  primary_diagnosis: LEMS with Autonomic Dysfunction
  presenting_complaint: Severe constipation and erectile dysfunction.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented primarily with autonomic symptoms including xerostomia, orthostatic hypotension, and chronic constipation. Subtle proximal weakness was noted on examination, and RNS confirmed LEMS. Treatment with pyridostigmine improved his autonomic symptoms, while amifampridine addressed the underlying motor weakness.

lambert_eaton_syndrome_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Persistent limb girdle weakness despite standard therapy.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with non-paraneoplastic LEMS failed to achieve adequate symptom control with amifampridine and azathioprine. Despite escalating doses, she remained wheelchair-dependent due to severe proximal hip weakness. She was eventually commenced on Rituximab infusions, which led to a gradual reduction in antibody titres and improved ambulatory status over six months.

lambert_eaton_syndrome_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic LEMS Exacerbation
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of weakness following antibiotic use.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old known LEMS patient was prescribed gentamicin for a suspected urinary tract infection, leading to a rapid decline in muscle strength. He presented to the emergency department unable to stand or swallow safely. He was treated with calcium gluconate and IVIG, highlighting the dangers of neuromuscular blocking medications in LEMS patients.

lambert_eaton_syndrome_009:
  primary_diagnosis: LEMS-Myasthenia Gravis Overlap Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Drooping eyelids and proximal leg fatigue.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female presented with a complex phenotype including fluctuating ptosis and exertional leg weakness. Serology was positive for both acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and VGCC antibodies. Electrophysiology showed both a decremental response at low frequencies and significant post-tetanic potentiation, requiring a tailored regimen of pyridostigmine and immunosuppression.

lambert_eaton_syndrome_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Early-stage Paraneoplastic LEMS
  presenting_complaint: Mild leg weakness and weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male presented with mild difficulty climbing stairs and a 5kg weight loss over two months. While initial chest X-ray was clear, positive VGCC antibodies prompted a PET-CT scan which revealed a hypermetabolic mediastinal lymph node. Biopsy confirmed SCLC, and his LEMS symptoms improved significantly following the initiation of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

lambert_eaton_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: LEMS with Bulbar Involvement
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty swallowing and slurred speech.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male presented with atypical bulbar symptoms, initially raising concerns for Motor Neurone Disease. However, the presence of diminished reflexes and post-exercise facilitation on NCS pointed towards LEMS. He was found to have high-titre VGCC antibodies and responded well to amifampridine, with complete resolution of dysphagia.

lambert_eaton_syndrome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Idiopathic LEMS
  presenting_complaint: Occasional leg "stiffness" during long walks.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male hiker reported that his legs felt stiff and heavy only after several miles of walking. Clinical examination was initially normal, but RNS performed after exercise showed a 120% increase in CMAP amplitude. He was diagnosed with mild idiopathic LEMS and managed conservatively with lifestyle adjustments and PRN pyridostigmine.

lambert_eaton_syndrome_013:
  primary_diagnosis: LEMS with Pseudo-obstruction
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal pain, bloating, and weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with LEMS presented with acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome). This rare autonomic complication required hospital admission for bowel decompression and intravenous neostigmine. His LEMS management was subsequently intensified with the addition of mycophenolate mofetil to prevent further autonomic crises.

lambert_eaton_syndrome_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Amifampridine-Induced Seizure in LEMS
  presenting_complaint: First-onset generalised tonic-clonic seizure.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female with LEMS was started on amifampridine, with the dose rapidly titrated to 80mg daily. She presented to A&E following a seizure, a known dose-related side effect of the medication. Her dose was reduced to 40mg daily with the addition of pyridostigmine, which maintained her strength without further neurological events.

lambert_eaton_syndrome_015:
  primary_diagnosis: LEMS in a Patient with Multiple Comorbidities
  presenting_complaint: Generalised weakness and frequent falls.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and ischaemic heart disease presented with worsening mobility. The diagnosis of LEMS was complicated by pre-existing diabetic peripheral neuropathy, making reflex assessment difficult. RNS was diagnostic, and her treatment required careful coordination to avoid exacerbating her cardiac condition or glycaemic control.

lambert_eaton_syndrome_016:
  primary_diagnosis: LEMS presenting as "Tiredness"
  presenting_complaint: Persistent lethargy and "heavy" limbs.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male was referred by his GP for chronic fatigue and "aching" muscles. Initial blood tests, including thyroid function and CK, were normal, but the patient noted that his strength briefly improved after walking. Specialist RNS confirmed LEMS, and he was started on a trial of amifampridine with an excellent symptomatic response.

lambert_eaton_syndrome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Pregnancy-associated LEMS Management
  presenting_complaint: Known LEMS patient planning pregnancy.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old woman with idiopathic LEMS was managed through a multidisciplinary pregnancy clinic. Her amifampridine was maintained at the lowest effective dose, and she was monitored closely for exacerbations. She had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery, although the neonate required 48 hours of observation for transient neonatal LEMS, which resolved spontaneously.

lambert_eaton_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Late-stage Paraneoplastic LEMS
  presenting_complaint: Severe immobility in the context of metastatic SCLC.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male with metastatic small cell lung cancer developed profound weakness, becoming bedbound. While LEMS was confirmed via VGCC antibodies, the focus of care shifted to palliation. Low-dose pyridostigmine was used to alleviate dry mouth and provide modest improvement in limb strength to facilitate transfers and improve quality of life.

lambert_eaton_syndrome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: LEMS with Co-morbid Graves' Disease
  presenting_complaint: Tremor, palpitations, and proximal muscle weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male presented with thyrotoxicosis and significant leg weakness. While the weakness was initially attributed to thyrotoxic myopathy, it persisted after achieving a euthyroid state. Subsequent testing revealed VGCC antibodies, confirming a dual autoimmune diagnosis of Graves' disease and LEMS.

lambert_eaton_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: LEMS with Diagnostic Delay
  presenting_complaint: Five-year history of progressive difficulty rising from a squat.
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old female had been told for years that her symptoms were related to "early-onset arthritis" and "fibromyalgia." A second opinion from a neurologist noted the classic "waxing" of strength on repeated testing and absent reflexes. RNS showed a 300% facilitation post-exercise, and the patient finally received a diagnosis of LEMS, significantly improving her outlook and treatment options.
