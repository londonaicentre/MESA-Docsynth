  primary_diagnosis: Mycotic aneurysm of the distal MCA
  presenting_complaint: Fever, malaise, and sudden onset headache
  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use and Infective Endocarditis (Staphylococcus aureus) developed a new headache. CTA identified a 4mm distal MCA branch aneurysm, consistent with a mycotic (infectious) origin. He was treated with a prolonged course of IV antibiotics, and follow-up imaging showed complete resolution of the aneurysm.

cerebral_aneurysm_nonruptured_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Recanalised coiled aneurysm
  presenting_complaint: Routine post-procedural angiographic follow-up
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female, previously treated with coiling for a 9mm ACom aneurysm three years ago, underwent routine DSA. The scan showed significant compaction of the coil mass and aneurysm recanalisation (Class III Raymond-Roy). She was scheduled for elective re-coiling to secure the remnant neck.

cerebral_aneurysm_nonruptured_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Traumatic pseudoaneurysm of the ICA
  presenting_complaint: Delayed epistaxis following facial trauma
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male presented with severe epistaxis three weeks after a road traffic accident involving skull base fractures. Angiography identified a pseudoaneurysm of the cavernous segment of the right ICA. This was successfully treated with endovascular parent vessel occlusion after a successful balloon test occlusion.

cerebral_aneurysm_nonruptured_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Multiple aneurysms in Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Family screening for connective tissue disorder
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female with Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (vEDS) underwent whole-body MRA. This revealed three small intracranial aneurysms (ACom, left MCA, and right PICA). Management focused on strict blood pressure control and avoidance of invasive procedures unless absolutely necessary due to high vascular friability.

cerebral_aneurysm_nonruptured_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Large cavernous ICA aneurysm
  presenting_complaint: Chronic retro-orbital pain and diplopia
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female presented with long-standing right-sided facial pain and sixth nerve palsy. MRI showed a 16mm aneurysm within the cavernous sinus. Given the low risk of subarachnoid haemorrhage in this location, she was treated with a flow-diverting stent to reduce mass effect and alleviate pain.

cerebral_aneurysm_nonruptured_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Small ACom aneurysm in a high-risk patient
  presenting_complaint: Anxiety regarding family history of SAH
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male, whose mother and sister both suffered fatal subarachnoid haemorrhages (SAH), requested screening. MRA found a 3mm ACom aneurysm. Despite the small size, the strong family history and patient anxiety led to a decision for elective endovascular coiling, which was performed without complication.

cerebral_aneurysm_nonruptured_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Distal PICA aneurysm
  presenting_complaint: Persistent occipital headache
  summary_of_course: A 53-year-old female presented with localized posterior headaches. CTA identified a 5mm aneurysm on the distal loop of the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). She underwent elective surgical clipping via a far-lateral craniotomy, with an unremarkable post-operative recovery.
