epiglottitis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute epiglottitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe sore throat, drooling, and difficulty breathing
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old unvaccinated child presented to A&E in a tripod position with a high fever of 39.5°C and inspiratory stridor. Urgent flexible fibreoptic laryngoscopy in theatre confirmed a cherry-red, swollen epiglottis. Following gas induction and endotracheal intubation, the patient received IV ceftriaxone and dexamethasone, with successful extubation after 48 hours and a full recovery.

epiglottitis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Adult epiglottitis
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive odynophagia and muffled voice
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male smoker presented with a 12-hour history of severe throat pain and a "hot potato" voice but no stridor. Lateral neck X-ray showed a positive "thumb sign," and direct visualisation revealed significant supraglottic oedema. He was monitored in the ICU for 24 hours, treated with IV co-amoxiclav and steroids, and avoided the need for an artificial airway.

epiglottitis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Epiglottic abscess
  presenting_complaint: Persistent severe throat pain and neck swelling
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes presented with worsening dysphagia despite 3 days of oral penicillin for suspected pharyngitis. CT neck with contrast identified a 1.5cm rim-enhancing fluid collection within the epiglottis. She underwent surgical incision and drainage under general anaesthesia and received a 10-day course of IV antibiotics for Staphylococcus aureus infection.

epiglottitis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Thermal epiglottitis
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of stridor after swallowing hot liquid
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old boy accidentally swallowed boiling tea and immediately developed respiratory distress and barking cough. Emergency department assessment noted significant oropharyngeal burns and progressive stridor. He was emergently intubated by the paediatric anaesthetic team; bronchoscopy confirmed isolated thermal injury to the epiglottis and aryepiglottic folds, managed with supportive care and humidified oxygen.

epiglottitis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute epiglottitis secondary to Group A Streptococcus
  presenting_complaint: Fever, rigors, and inability to swallow secretions
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old healthy male presented with a 6-hour history of rapidly worsening throat pain and systemic sepsis. Blood cultures and epiglottic swabs grew Streptococcus pyogenes. Despite aggressive IV fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics, he developed septic shock requiring vasopressor support in the ICU, though his airway remained patent with conservative management.

epiglottitis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute epiglottitis
  presenting_complaint: Low-grade fever and mild discomfort when swallowing
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) reported a 4-day history of mild odynophagia and a persistent low-grade fever. Outpatient ENT review using flexible nasendoscopy revealed moderate epiglottic erythema and thickening. He was admitted for observation and IV piperacillin/tazobactam due to his immunocompromised status, preventing progression to airway obstruction.

epiglottitis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute epiglottitis with life-threatening airway obstruction
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of stridor and cyanosis
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female presented with a 2-hour history of sore throat that rapidly progressed to total airway occlusion in the ambulance. On arrival, emergency front-of-neck access (needle cricothyroidotomy) was performed followed by formal tracheostomy in theatre. Findings showed massive supraglottic swelling, and she remained tracheostomy-dependent for 7 days before decannulation.

epiglottitis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Traumatic epiglottitis
  presenting_complaint: Throat pain and hoarseness following blunt neck trauma
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male was struck in the neck by a ball during a rugby match, subsequently developing progressive hoarseness. Flexible laryngoscopy showed a large haematoma involving the lingual surface of the epiglottis mimicking acute epiglottitis. He was managed with head-of-bed elevation, IV dexamethasone, and serial airway assessments, with resolution of the haematoma over 5 days.

epiglottitis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent epiglottitis
  presenting_complaint: Third episode of severe sore throat and dysphagia in 12 months
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female presented with classic signs of epiglottitis for the third time in a year. Subsequent MRI imaging of the neck identified an underlying vallecular cyst that frequently became infected, involving the epiglottis. Following resolution of the acute infection with antibiotics, she underwent elective endoscopic laser excision of the cyst to prevent further recurrence.

epiglottitis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Candida epiglottitis
  presenting_complaint: Subacute dysphagia and white plaques in the oropharynx
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old HIV-positive patient with a low CD4 count presented with a 1-week history of worsening throat pain. Nasendoscopy revealed a thickened epiglottis covered in thick white exudates, which grew Candida albicans on culture. He was treated with IV fluconazole and saw significant improvement in symptoms within 72 hours without requiring airway intervention.

epiglottitis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute epiglottitis (Hib-negative)
  presenting_complaint: Fever, drooling, and muffled voice in a school-aged child
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old fully vaccinated child presented with acute onset fever and dysphagia. Despite Hib vaccination, laryngoscopy confirmed classic epiglottitis; cultures later grew Haemophilus influenzae type f. The patient was managed in the PICU with a short period of intubation and a 7-day course of IV ceftriaxone, highlighting the risk from non-typeable strains.

epiglottitis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute epiglottitis mimicking croup
  presenting_complaint: Barking cough and stridor
  summary_of_course: A 2-year-old girl was initially treated by her GP for croup with oral dexamethasone, but returned 6 hours later with worsening stridor and high fever. Unlike typical croup, she was leaning forward and drooling. Urgent ENT assessment identified acute epiglottitis; she was stabilized with nebulised adrenaline before controlled intubation in theatre.

epiglottitis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Chemical epiglottitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe throat pain and respiratory distress after inhalation
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male presented after inhaling caustic fumes during an industrial accident. He developed rapid-onset supraglottic oedema specifically targeting the epiglottis and arytenoids. He required 72 hours of mechanical ventilation and high-dose IV corticosteroids to reduce mucosal swelling before successful extubation.

epiglottitis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute epiglottitis in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Severe odynophagia and shortness of breath
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old woman at 32 weeks gestation presented with a 24-hour history of sore throat and worsening respiratory effort. Multidisciplinary management involving ENT, Anaesthetics, and Obstetrics was initiated. She was managed conservatively with IV antibiotics and steroids in a high-dependency unit, with continuous foetal monitoring, avoiding preterm delivery or airway intervention.

epiglottitis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic epiglottitis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of chronic mild throat discomfort
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with chronic COPD and mild persistent dysphagia presented with acute respiratory distress and inability to swallow saliva. Nasendoscopy showed an acutely inflamed epiglottis superimposed on chronic structural changes. He was treated with IV hydrocortisone and ceftriaxone, but due to poor respiratory reserve, he required non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in the ICU.

epiglottitis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute epiglottitis with treatment failure
  presenting_complaint: Worsening symptoms despite 48 hours of IV antibiotics
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male was admitted with epiglottitis and started on IV cefuroxime. After 48 hours, his fever persisted and stridor developed; repeat imaging showed an enlarging phlegmon. Antibiotics were escalated to meropenem and linezolid after cultures identified MRSA, leading to clinical improvement over the following 5 days.

epiglottitis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute epiglottitis mimicking infectious mononucleosis
  presenting_complaint: Severe sore throat, cervical lymphadenopathy, and fatigue
  summary_of_course: A 17-year-old male was initially suspected of having glandular fever due to tonsillar hypertrophy and lymphadenopathy. However, his refusal to swallow fluids and a "tripod" posture prompted nasendoscopy, revealing a severely swollen, "omega-shaped" epiglottis. He was admitted for IV steroids and antibiotics, and Monospot testing was negative.

epiglottitis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-extubation epiglottic oedema
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent stridor after removal of endotracheal tube
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old child treated for acute epiglottitis underwent planned extubation after a leak test. However, within 1 hour, stridor recurred due to rebound oedema of the epiglottis. He was re-intubated for a further 24 hours and given a bolus of IV methylprednisolone, which allowed for a successful second extubation attempt.

epiglottitis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild adult epiglottitis (outpatient management)
  presenting_complaint: Moderate odynophagia and localized throat tenderness
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old healthy female presented with a 2-day history of pain localized to the hyoid bone area. Nasendoscopy showed mild erythema and slight swelling of the epiglottis with no airway compromise. Given her stability and proximity to the hospital, she was managed with oral co-amoxiclav and daily ENT clinic reviews, avoiding hospital admission.

epiglottitis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute epiglottitis with associated meningitis
  presenting_complaint: Fever, headache, neck stiffness, and sore throat
  summary_of_course: An 18-month-old infant presented with a high fever, bulging fontanelle, and inspiratory stridor. Clinical examination and imaging confirmed both acute epiglottitis and signs of meningeal irritation. Lumbar puncture and epiglottic cultures both grew Streptococcus pneumoniae, requiring a 14-day course of high-dose IV cephalosporins and intensive care support.
