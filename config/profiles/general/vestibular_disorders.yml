  primary_diagnosis: Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)
  presenting_complaint: Brief episodes of intense room-spinning vertigo triggered by turning in bed.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female presented to her GP with 30-second bursts of vertigo when rolling onto her right side. Physical examination revealed a positive Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre with geotropic nystagmus. She was successfully treated with an Epley manoeuvre in the clinic, with complete resolution of symptoms at a two-week follow-up.

vestibular_disorders_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Vestibular Neuritis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of severe, continuous vertigo, nausea, and vomiting.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with no prior otological history presented to A&E with acute spontaneous vertigo and horizontal-torsional nystagmus beating away from the affected left side. Clinical HINTS exam was consistent with a peripheral vestibulopathy, and hearing was preserved on bedside testing. He was managed with a short course of prochlorperazine and early vestibular rehabilitation exercises, showing significant compensation over six weeks.

vestibular_disorders_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Meniere's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Episodic vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, and a "roaring" tinnitus in the right ear.
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old female reported recurrent episodes of vertigo lasting 3 hours, associated with a feeling of fullness in her right ear. Pure tone audiometry demonstrated a low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. She was started on a low-salt diet and betahistine 16mg TDS, which reduced the frequency of attacks from twice weekly to once every three months.

vestibular_disorders_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Vestibular Migraine
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent dizziness associated with photophobia and moderate throbbing headache.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old woman with a history of childhood motion sickness presented with episodic vertigo lasting minutes to hours. Neurological examination and MRI of the internal auditory meatus were unremarkable. A diagnosis of vestibular migraine was made based on the association with migrainous features, and symptoms were well-controlled with lifestyle modifications and amitriptyline 10mg nocte.

vestibular_disorders_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Viral Labyrinthitis
  presenting_complaint: Acute vertigo and sudden unilateral hearing loss following a viral upper respiratory tract infection.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male developed severe vertigo and deafness in the left ear three days after a sore throat.

He was treated with a tapering course of oral prednisolone and cyclizine; while the vertigo subsided, he was left with permanent unilateral hearing impairment.

vestibular_disorders_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Vestibular Schwannoma (Acoustic Neuroma)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive imbalance and unilateral high-pitched tinnitus.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female reported a two-year history of worsening steady imbalance and left-sided tinnitus. Audiometry showed an asymmetrical sensorineural hearing loss at 4kHz and 8kHz. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI revealed a 1.2cm mass in the left cerebellopontine angle, which is currently being managed via a "watch and wait" strategy with annual imaging.

vestibular_disorders_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Perilymph Fistula
  presenting_complaint: Vertigo and hearing loss immediately following a forceful sneeze.
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old male experienced a "pop" in his right ear followed by acute vertigo and fluctuating hearing loss after sneezing. A positive Hennebert's sign (vertigo induced by pressure on the tragus) was noted. He underwent middle ear exploration which confirmed a fistula at the oval window, which was patched with fascia, resulting in resolution of the vertigo.

  primary_diagnosis: Superior Semicircular Canal Dehiscence (SSCD)
  presenting_complaint: Autophony and vertigo induced by loud noises (Tullio phenomenon).
  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old male complained of hearing his own heartbeat and eye movements, alongside dizziness when exposed to loud music. Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials (VEMP) showed abnormally low thresholds on the left. High-resolution CT of the temporal bones confirmed a dehiscence of the superior canal, and he was referred for surgical resurfacing.

vestibular_disorders_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Persistent Postural-Perceptual Dizziness (PPPD)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic "rocking" sensation and lightheadedness for over six months.
  summary_of_course: A 43-year-old female developed persistent dizziness following an initial bout of BPPV that had resolved. She described her symptoms as worse in busy environments like supermarkets and improved when lying down. After normal vestibular function tests, she was diagnosed with PPPD and showed significant improvement with a combination of Sertraline and specialised vestibular physiotherapy.

vestibular_disorders_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Mal de Debarquement Syndrome (MdDS)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent sensation of swaying or bobbing after returning from a week-long cruise.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old woman reported that the "sea legs" she felt on a cruise ship did not disappear after disembarking. Paradoxically, her symptoms improved when she was a passenger in a moving car. She was diagnosed with MdDS and managed with clonazepam and habituation exercises, with gradual resolution of symptoms over nine months.

vestibular_disorders_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Bilateral Vestibulopathy
  presenting_complaint: Severe oscillopsia (blurred vision when moving) and significant gait instability.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with a history of gentamicin treatment for endocarditis developed a permanent loss of balance. Bedside testing showed a positive head impulse test bilaterally and a broad-based gait. Caloric testing confirmed bilateral vestibular failure, and he now relies on intensive long-term vestibular rehabilitation and visual cues for mobility.

vestibular_disorders_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Vertebrobasilar Insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Brief episodes of vertigo triggered by extending the neck, associated with double vision.
  summary_of_course: An 84-year-old male with hypertension and atrial fibrillation presented with transient vertigo and diplopia when looking up. CT angiography revealed significant stenosis of the V3 segment of the vertebral artery. He was managed with optimisation of antiplatelet therapy and blood pressure control to prevent a posterior circulation stroke.

vestibular_disorders_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Cerebellar Infarction
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of severe vertigo, headache, and inability to walk.
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old male smoker presented with sudden vertigo and truncal ataxia. Clinical HINTS exam showed a normal head impulse test and direction-changing nystagmus, suggesting a central cause. Urgent MRI confirmed an acute infarct in the territory of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), and he was admitted to the stroke unit for monitoring and rehabilitation.

  primary_diagnosis: Ramsay Hunt Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Severe ear pain, vertigo, and a drooping right side of the face.
  summary_of_course: A 57-year-old female presented with a painful vesicular rash in the right external auditory canal and ipsilateral facial nerve palsy. She reported significant vertigo and nausea. She was treated with oral aciclovir and prednisolone within 48 hours of onset; the vertigo improved, but she retained a Grade III House-Brackmann facial weakness.

vestibular_disorders_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Benign Paroxysmal Vertigo of Childhood
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent, brief episodes of sudden-onset vertigo and pallor in a 6-year-old.
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old boy experienced monthly episodes where he would suddenly grab his mother, look pale, and complain of the room moving, lasting only 2 minutes. Neurological exam, hearing tests, and EEG were all normal. He was diagnosed with benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood, a migraine precursor, and the episodes gradually ceased by age 9 without pharmacological intervention.

  primary_diagnosis: Wallenberg Syndrome (Lateral Medullary Infarct)
  presenting_complaint: Vertigo, hoarseness, and loss of pain sensation on the left face and right body.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male presented with acute vertigo, hiccups, and dysphagia. Examination revealed left-sided Horner's syndrome and crossed sensory loss. MRI brain confirmed a left lateral medullary infarct; he was admitted to the ICU for airway protection due to severe bulbar palsy before transitioning to a stroke rehabilitation ward.

vestibular_disorders_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Vestibular Paroxysmia
  presenting_complaint: Hundreds of very brief (seconds) vertigo attacks occurring daily.
  summary_of_course: A 49-year-old male reported frequent, short-lived "zaps" of dizziness triggered by head movements. MRI with high-resolution sequences (FIESTA) demonstrated a vascular loop of the AICA in close contact with the eighth cranial nerve. His symptoms responded dramatically to low-dose carbamazepine (100mg BD), confirming the diagnosis of neurovascular cross-compression.
