flushing_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Carcinoid syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Paroxysmal facial flushing and chronic watery diarrhoea
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male presented with a six-month history of episodic bright red flushing of the face and neck lasting 20 minutes. Investigations confirmed elevated 24-hour urinary 5-HIAA levels and a CT scan identified a 3cm terminal ileal mass with mesenteric lymphadenopathy. He was commenced on subcutaneous octreotide injections, which significantly reduced the frequency of flushing episodes and improved his bowel symptoms.

flushing_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Anaphylaxis
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset flushing, wheeze, and facial swelling
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old girl was brought to A&E after developing generalised flushing and respiratory distress minutes after consuming a snack containing peanuts. On arrival, she was hypotensive (BP 75/40 mmHg) with audible stridor and widespread urticaria. She was treated immediately with intramuscular adrenaline (300mcg), intravenous fluids, and high-flow oxygen, resulting in rapid stabilisation before admission for 24-hour observation.

flushing_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Menopausal vasomotor symptoms
  presenting_complaint: Frequent hot flushes and night sweats
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female reported a one-year history of intense heat sensations starting in the chest and radiating to the face, occurring ten times daily. Physical examination was unremarkable, but blood tests showed a significantly elevated Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) level of 75 IU/L. After discussing risks and benefits, she was started on transdermal oestrogen and oral progesterone, which led to a 90% reduction in symptoms within four weeks.

flushing_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Phaeochromocytoma
  presenting_complaint: Episodic flushing, palpitations, and severe headaches
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old woman presented with paroxysmal episodes of flushing followed by pallor, associated with profuse sweating and a pounding heart. During an episode in the clinic, her blood pressure was recorded at 210/115 mmHg. Plasma metanephrines were five times the upper limit of normal, and an MRI confirmed a 4cm right-sided adrenal mass; she underwent successful laparoscopic adrenalectomy after pre-operative alpha-blockade with phenoxybenzamine.

flushing_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea
  presenting_complaint: Persistent facial redness and easy flushing with triggers
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male presented with chronic redness over his cheeks and nose that worsened after drinking red wine or eating spicy food. Clinical examination revealed fixed centrofacial erythema and multiple fine telangiectasia without papules or pustules. He was advised on trigger avoidance and prescribed topical brimonidine gel for symptomatic relief of the flushing, alongside a trial of metronidazole cream.

flushing_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Niacin-induced flushing
  presenting_complaint: Intense burning and flushing of the face and arms
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female with refractory hyperlipidaemia was started on high-dose nicotinic acid (niacin) by her cardiologist. Within 30 minutes of her first 500mg dose, she experienced a severe, prickly heat sensation and vivid flushing across her upper body. She was advised to take aspirin 30 minutes prior to the niacin dose and to take the medication with food, which successfully mitigated the prostaglandin-mediated vasomotor response.

flushing_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Scombroid fish poisoning
  presenting_complaint: Rapid onset flushing, headache, and abdominal cramps after a meal
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male presented to the Urgent Care Centre one hour after eating grilled mackerel at a local restaurant. He exhibited a "sunburn-like" flush of the face and torso, tachycardia, and complained of a metallic taste in his mouth. Given the classic presentation of histamine toxicity from improperly stored fish, he was treated with oral antihistamines (cetirizine and famotidine) and his symptoms resolved completely within six hours.

flushing_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Serotonin syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Acute flushing, agitation, and muscle rigidity
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male was admitted to the ICU after being found confused and diaphoretic following the addition of tramadol to his existing fluoxetine prescription. Clinical signs included intense flushing, spontaneous muscle clonus, and a temperature of 39.2°C. He was managed with aggressive cooling, intravenous midazolam for sedation, and the serotonin antagonist cyproheptadine, leading to a full recovery over 48 hours.

flushing_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Systemic mastocytosis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent flushing episodes and unexplained syncope
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented with a history of "attacks" characterised by intense flushing, abdominal pain, and occasional loss of consciousness. Skin biopsy of several small, reddish-brown macules showed dense mast cell infiltrates, and her serum tryptase was persistently elevated at 45 ng/mL. She was started on a regimen of H1 and H2 receptor antagonists and sodium cromoglicate, which significantly reduced the frequency and severity of her systemic episodes.

flushing_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Superior Vena Cava Obstruction (SVCO)
  presenting_complaint: Facial flushing, fullness, and distended neck veins
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male smoker presented with a subacute onset of facial puffiness and a dusky purple flush that worsened when bending forward. Examination revealed non-pulsatile distension of the jugular veins and prominent collateral vessels over the anterior chest wall. A CT thorax confirmed a large right hilar mass compressing the superior vena cava; he was urgently started on high-dose dexamethasone and referred for emergency radiotherapy.

flushing_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Frey's syndrome (Auriculotemporal syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Unilateral facial flushing and sweating while eating
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old woman noticed that her left cheek became red and damp whenever she ate chocolate or citrus fruits, following a parotidectomy two years prior. The diagnosis of gustatory flushing was confirmed with a starch-iodine test which showed sweat production in the distribution of the auriculotemporal nerve. She chose to manage the condition with topical glycopyrrolate cream, which effectively inhibited the aberrant parasympathetic response.

flushing_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Autonomic dysreflexia
  presenting_complaint: Sudden severe headache and flushing above the level of injury
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old male with a known T4 spinal cord injury was brought to A&E with a blood pressure of 190/110 mmHg and intense flushing of the face and neck. The medical team identified a blocked urinary catheter as the noxious stimulus causing an uninhibited sympathetic discharge. Once the catheter was flushed and the bladder drained, his blood pressure rapidly normalised and the flushing subsided immediately.

flushing_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcohol-induced flushing (ALDH2 deficiency)
  presenting_complaint: Immediate facial flushing and nausea after small amounts of alcohol
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female of East Asian descent reported that even half a glass of beer caused her face to turn bright red and her heart to race. This was identified as a genetic deficiency in the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 enzyme, leading to acetaldehyde accumulation. She was advised that this is a benign but permanent genetic trait and that avoiding alcohol is the only effective way to prevent the reaction.

flushing_014:
  primary_diagnosis: VIPoma (Verner-Morrison syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Profuse watery diarrhoea and episodic flushing
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old woman was admitted with severe dehydration, hypokalaemia (K+ 2.1 mmol/L), and achlorhydria. She described intermittent episodes of truncal flushing that accompanied her voluminous "tea-like" stools. Imaging revealed a 5cm mass in the tail of the pancreas, and a markedly elevated plasma Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) level confirmed the diagnosis; the tumour was subsequently resected.

flushing_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Late dumping syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Post-prandial flushing, dizziness, and sweating
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male who underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for obesity presented with episodes of flushing and tremulousness occurring two hours after eating high-carb meals. A supervised mixed-meal tolerance test demonstrated a late-phase hypoglycaemic dip (glucose 2.8 mmol/L) following initial hyperglycaemia. He was managed successfully by a specialist dietitian with a low-glycaemic index diet and frequent, smaller meals.

flushing_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Panic disorder
  presenting_complaint: Sudden episodes of flushing, chest tightness, and fear of dying
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old university student presented to her GP with recurrent, unpredictable episodes of intense facial flushing, palpitations, and shortness of breath. Physical examinations, thyroid function tests, and ECGs were all normal. She was diagnosed with panic disorder and commenced on a course of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and a low-dose SSRI, which led to a gradual reduction in the frequency of her autonomic surges.

flushing_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Calcium channel blocker induced flushing
  presenting_complaint: Chronic facial flushing and ankle swelling
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male with long-standing hypertension was reviewd in the outpatient clinic due to persistent facial warmth and bilateral peripheral oedema. He had been started on amlodipine 10mg daily three months prior. Attributing the symptoms to the vasodilatory effects of the medication, his GP switched him to an ACE inhibitor (Ramipril), resulting in complete resolution of both the flushing and the oedema within two weeks.

flushing_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Harlequin syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Unilateral facial flushing and sweating during exercise
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old woman noticed that during gym sessions, only the right side of her face would become red and sweaty, while the left side remained pale and dry. Neurological assessment suggested a deficit in the sympathetic innervation to the left side of the face, making the right-sided flushing a compensatory over-activity. An MRI of the neck and upper chest ruled out compressive lesions like Pancoast tumours, and she was reassured that the condition was idiopathic and benign.

flushing_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent neck lump and occasional flushing
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old man presented with a firm, painless nodule in the left lobe of his thyroid and intermittent facial flushing. Fine needle aspiration and a serum calcitonin level of 1200 pg/mL (normal <10) confirmed medullary thyroid carcinoma. He underwent a total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection; genetic testing subsequently identified a RET proto-oncogene mutation, consistent with MEN2A syndrome.

flushing_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)
  presenting_complaint: Photosensitive facial flushing and joint pains
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old female presented with a persistent "butterfly" flush across her cheeks and bridge of the nose that flared significantly after sun exposure. She also reported morning stiffness in her fingers and profound fatigue. Laboratory investigations showed a high-titre ANA (1:1280) and positive anti-dsDNA antibodies, confirming a diagnosis of SLE; she was commenced on hydroxychloroquine and advised on strict sun protection.
