He was treated with a four-week course of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine with complete resolution of cardiac symptoms.

toxoplasmosis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Gestational toxoplasmosis
  presenting_complaint: Routine antenatal screening showing seroconversion.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old pregnant woman at 14 weeks gestation was found to have positive Toxoplasma IgM and IgG on routine screening, having been seronegative pre-conception. Spiramycin was immediately initiated to reduce the risk of vertical transmission. Subsequent amniocentesis at 18 weeks was PCR negative for T. gondii, and the pregnancy continued under close ultrasound surveillance.

toxoplasmosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Pulmonary toxoplasmosis
  presenting_complaint: Fever, non-productive cough, and bilateral lung opacities.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male undergoing chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia developed febrile neutropenia and diffuse interstitial infiltrates on CT. Sputum cultures were negative, but T. gondii was identified on silver stain of a transbronchial biopsy. He responded well to a prolonged course of atovaquone and pyrimethamine.

toxoplasmosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic ocular toxoplasmosis
  presenting_complaint: Gradual loss of peripheral vision in the left eye.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with a history of recurrent uveitis presented with extensive chorioretinal scarring. Diagnostic aqueous humour sampling confirmed the presence of Toxoplasma DNA via PCR. Due to the proximity of the lesions to the macula, he was placed on long-term prophylactic co-trimoxazole to prevent further sight-threatening relapses.

toxoplasmosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Toxoplasmic encephalitis in an immunocompetent host
  presenting_complaint: Severe headache, photophobia, and confusion.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy presented with signs of meningoencephalitis following a camping trip. Lumbar puncture showed lymphocytic pleocytosis, and CSF PCR was positive for Toxoplasma gondii. This rare presentation in an otherwise healthy child was treated successfully with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for six weeks.

toxoplasmosis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Toxoplasmosis mimicking lymphoma
  presenting_complaint: Massive bilateral axillary and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female was referred to haematology for suspected Hodgkin's lymphoma due to bulky adenopathy and night sweats. Excisional biopsy revealed reactive follicular hyperplasia and clusters of epithelioid histiocytes (Piringer-Kuchinka lymphadenitis). Serology confirmed acute toxoplasmosis, and the nodes regressed over several months without chemotherapy.

toxoplasmosis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent toxoplasmic chorioretinitis (Treatment Failure)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent blurred vision despite previous treatment.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male experienced a third relapse of ocular toxoplasmosis within one year despite standard pyrimethamine/sulfadiazine therapy. Resistance was suspected, and treatment was switched to clindamycin and intravitreal injections of clindamycin and dexamethasone. This intensified regimen achieved lesion cicatrisation and stabilised his vision.

toxoplasmosis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute toxoplasmosis in HSCT recipient
  presenting_complaint: Unexplained lethargy and low-grade fever post-stem cell transplant.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female, 60 days post-haematopoietic stem cell transplant, was monitored via weekly blood PCR due to pre-transplant IgG positivity. A rising viral load was detected before clinical deterioration, allowing for pre-emptive treatment with co-trimoxazole. This early intervention prevented the development of overt cerebral or disseminated disease.

toxoplasmosis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Disseminated toxoplasmosis on TNF-alpha inhibitors
  presenting_complaint: Fever, maculopapular rash, and pneumonia.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male receiving Adalimumab for rheumatoid arthritis presented with a multi-system febrile illness. Skin biopsy of the rash and BAL fluid both identified tachyzoites of Toxoplasma gondii. Immunosuppression was temporarily halted, and he was treated with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, leading to a slow recovery.

toxoplasmosis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Late-onset congenital ocular toxoplasmosis
  presenting_complaint: Reduced visual acuity discovered during a school eye test.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old girl with no prior medical history was found to have a large, inactive chorioretinal scar in the macula of the left eye. Retrospective maternal history suggested an undiagnosed febrile illness during pregnancy. The case was managed as a late-presenting congenital toxoplasmosis, requiring no acute treatment but regular ophthalmological monitoring.

  presenting_complaint: High fever, pancytopenia, and splenomegaly.
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old male presented with features of Haemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), including hyperferritinaemia and cytopenias. Bone marrow aspirate showed haemophagocytosis and Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites. Treatment directed at toxoplasmosis led to the resolution of the HLH without the need for traditional etoposide-based protocols.

toxoplasmosis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Toxoplasmosis in febrile neutropenia
  presenting_complaint: Persistent fever despite broad-spectrum antibiotics.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female with refractory lymphoma and prolonged neutropenia remained febrile despite seven days of Meropenem and Vancomycin. A "fever of unknown origin" workup included Toxoplasma PCR, which returned positive. Initiation of sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine led to defervescence within 48 hours, highlighting the importance of considering parasites in the immunocompromised.
