hyperaldosteronism_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Conn's syndrome (Aldosterone-producing adenoma)
  presenting_complaint: Resistant hypertension and muscle cramps
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented with a blood pressure of 185/110 mmHg despite taking three antihypertensive agents. Investigations revealed a serum potassium of 2.9 mmol/L and a significantly elevated aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR). A CT scan identified a 1.2cm left adrenal nodule, and adrenal vein sampling (AVS) confirmed lateralisation of aldosterone production. Following a laparoscopic left adrenalectomy, her potassium levels normalised and her blood pressure was well-controlled on a single agent.

hyperaldosteronism_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (BAH)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent hypertension and nocturia
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with a 10-year history of hypertension presented with worsening nocturia and mild fatigue. Laboratory tests showed a borderline low potassium of 3.5 mmol/L and suppressed renin levels. A saline infusion suppression test confirmed primary hyperaldosteronism, while CT imaging showed bilateral adrenal limb thickening. He was started on Eplerenone 25mg daily, which successfully lowered his blood pressure and resolved the nocturia.

hyperaldosteronism_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (GRA)
  presenting_complaint: Severe hypertension in a teenager
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old male was referred for investigation of a blood pressure of 160/105 mmHg found during a sports physical. His family history was significant for early-onset stroke in his father at age 32. Genetic testing identified a CYP11B1/CYP11B2 chimeric gene fusion, confirming Familial Hyperaldosteronism Type I. Treatment with low-dose Dexamethasone resulted in prompt normalisation of blood pressure and suppression of aldosterone levels.

hyperaldosteronism_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Adrenocortical carcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Rapid onset hypertension and hirsutism
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female presented with a three-month history of rapidly worsening hypertension, weight loss, and new-onset facial hair growth. Biochemistry showed profound hypokalaemia (2.2 mmol/L) and extremely high aldosterone levels alongside elevated cortisol and androgens. An abdominal CT revealed an 8cm heterogeneous right adrenal mass with local invasion. She underwent radical surgery followed by Mitotane therapy, though the prognosis remains guarded due to the advanced stage.

hyperaldosteronism_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary hyperaldosteronism due to renal artery stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Flash pulmonary oedema and refractory hypertension
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male smoker presented to the emergency department with acute shortness of breath and a blood pressure of 220/120 mmHg. Examination revealed bilateral renal bruits and crackles at the lung bases. Investigations showed elevated levels of both renin and aldosterone, suggesting a secondary cause. Renal MRA confirmed 85% stenosis of the right renal artery, and the patient underwent successful percutaneous renal artery stenting.

hyperaldosteronism_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Conn's syndrome with hypokalaemic paralysis
  presenting_complaint: Acute lower limb paralysis
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male of East Asian descent was admitted with sudden-onset inability to walk and profound muscle weakness. Initial labs showed a life-threatening potassium level of 1.7 mmol/L and metabolic alkalosis. After emergency intravenous potassium replacement, further workup revealed a high ARR and a right-sided adrenal adenoma. He was stabilised with Spironolactone before undergoing a successful right adrenalectomy.

hyperaldosteronism_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Normokalaemic primary hyperaldosteronism
  presenting_complaint: Incidental adrenal mass on imaging
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male underwent a CT scan for suspected nephrolithiasis, which incidentally found a 1.5cm left adrenal nodule. Despite being normokalaemic (K 4.1 mmol/L), his blood pressure was 155/95 mmHg. Screening showed a high ARR, and a subsequent fludrocortisone suppression test confirmed primary hyperaldosteronism. AVS confirmed left-sided lateralisation, and the patient opted for surgical resection.

hyperaldosteronism_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary hyperaldosteronism in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Severe hypertension at 24 weeks gestation
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old pregnant female presented with a blood pressure of 170/110 mmHg and persistent hypokalaemia. Preeclampsia was ruled out, and biochemical screening showed suppressed renin with elevated aldosterone. An MRI without gadolinium identified a small left adrenal nodule. She was managed with Nifedipine and Amiloride to maintain potassium and blood pressure, with plans for definitive surgical management postpartum.

hyperaldosteronism_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Pseudohyperaldosteronism (Licorice ingestion)
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue and hypertension
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female presented with a blood pressure of 190/100 mmHg and a potassium of 2.6 mmol/L. Curiously, both her renin and aldosterone levels were found to be suppressed. Detailed dietary history revealed she had been consuming 200g of natural black licorice daily for six months. Upon cessation of licorice intake, her blood pressure and potassium levels returned to normal within four weeks.

hyperaldosteronism_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia with Spironolactone intolerance
  presenting_complaint: Painful gynaecomastia and erectile dysfunction
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with confirmed bilateral adrenal hyperplasia was initially treated with Spironolactone 100mg daily. After three months, he developed bilateral painful gynaecomastia and sexual dysfunction. He was switched to Eplerenone 50mg twice daily, which maintained his blood pressure at 130/80 mmHg and led to the gradual resolution of his breast tenderness and systemic side effects.

hyperaldosteronism_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Liddle syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Severe paediatric hypertension
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old girl was referred for investigation of a blood pressure of 150/95 mmHg. Laboratory results showed hypokalaemia and metabolic alkalosis, but both renin and aldosterone were nearly undetectable. Genetic testing confirmed a gain-of-function mutation in the ENaC sodium channel (Liddle syndrome). She responded excellently to Amiloride, which directly blocks the overactive channel, whereas Spironolactone had been ineffective.

hyperaldosteronism_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary hyperaldosteronism with Atrial Fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations and dizzy spells
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male presented with new-onset atrial fibrillation and a blood pressure of 165/105 mmHg. His potassium was chronically low at 3.1 mmol/L. Screening for primary hyperaldosteronism was positive, and CT imaging showed a right adrenal adenoma. Following anticoagulation and rate control, he underwent adrenalectomy, which led to the spontaneous reversion to sinus rhythm and normalisation of blood pressure.

hyperaldosteronism_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Familial Hyperaldosteronism Type II
  presenting_complaint: Early-onset hypertension with positive family history
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female presented with a blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg. Her father and older brother had both been diagnosed with Conn's syndrome in their early 30s. Biochemical screening confirmed primary hyperaldosteronism, and imaging showed a small left nodule. Genetic testing for known mutations was negative, but the family cluster strongly suggested Type II familial disease. She is currently managed medically with Eplerenone.

hyperaldosteronism_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary hyperaldosteronism with Chronic Kidney Disease
  presenting_complaint: Difficult to control hypertension in CKD
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female with Stage 3b CKD (eGFR 35) and long-standing hypertension presented with refractory BP of 175/90 mmHg. Diagnosing hyperaldosteronism was challenging due to her renal impairment affecting ARR interpretation. A captopril challenge test was performed, confirming autonomous aldosterone production. Due to her comorbidities and surgical risk, she was managed with low-dose Spironolactone and meticulous monitoring of her potassium and creatinine levels.

hyperaldosteronism_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic hypertension with hypertensive encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Severe headache, confusion, and blurred vision
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female with known mild hypertension presented in a hypertensive crisis (BP 230/130 mmHg) and confusion. Labs showed a potassium of 2.3 mmol/L. Once stabilised with intravenous nitroprusside, investigation revealed a left adrenal adenoma. The acute presentation was attributed to the unmasking of chronic primary hyperaldosteronism by a period of high dietary sodium intake. She later underwent successful surgery.

hyperaldosteronism_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Unilateral adrenal hyperplasia
  presenting_complaint: Resistant hypertension and leg weakness
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female presented with hypertension resistant to four medications. CT imaging of the adrenals was entirely normal. However, due to high clinical suspicion and a high ARR, adrenal vein sampling was performed, which demonstrated a 5:1 lateralisation ratio to the right side. Histopathology following right adrenalectomy revealed zona glomerulosa hyperplasia rather than a discrete adenoma, and her symptoms resolved postoperatively.

hyperaldosteronism_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary hyperaldosteronism presenting as TIA
  presenting_complaint: Transient right-sided weakness and slurred speech
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female was admitted following a 20-minute episode of hemiparesis. Her blood pressure on admission was 205/115 mmHg and potassium was 3.0 mmol/L. After a TIA was confirmed and stabilized, workup for the underlying cause of hypertension revealed a left-sided Conn's adenoma. Adrenalectomy was performed to reduce her high cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk profile.

hyperaldosteronism_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Renin-secreting tumour (Juxtaglomerular cell tumour)
  presenting_complaint: Severe hypertension and polyuria
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male presented with a blood pressure of 190/115 mmHg and excessive thirst. Labs showed secondary hyperaldosteronism with extremely high levels of both renin and aldosterone. A CT of the abdomen did not show adrenal pathology but identified a 2cm vascular mass in the lower pole of the left kidney. Excision of the juxtaglomerular cell tumour resulted in immediate cure of his hypertension.

hyperaldosteronism_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Conn's syndrome with treatment failure (recurrent)
  presenting_complaint: Return of hypertension post-adrenalectomy
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male who had a left adrenalectomy for Conn's syndrome three years prior presented with a return of hypertension (170/105 mmHg) and hypokalaemia. Repeat biochemistry confirmed the recurrence of primary hyperaldosteronism. A new CT and AVS demonstrated that the remaining right adrenal gland had now developed an aldosterone-secreting nodule. He was transitioned to lifelong mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy to avoid bilateral adrenalectomy.

hyperaldosteronism_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary hyperaldosteronism in an elderly patient with polypharmacy
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent falls and generalised weakness
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male on six different medications for various comorbidities presented with frequent falls. Initial assessment found a blood pressure of 165/90 mmHg and a potassium of 2.7 mmol/L, initially blamed on his thiazide diuretic. After a medication washout and switching to Doxazosin, ARR was found to be elevated. CT showed bilateral nodules, and he was successfully managed with low-dose Eplerenone, which improved his strength and BP.
