tricuspid_insufficiency_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild physiological tricuspid regurgitation
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic; incidental finding on routine screening
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male athlete underwent an echocardiogram for a sports scholarship. Results showed a structurally normal heart with trace/mild central tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and a peak gradient of 20 mmHg. No further investigation or treatment was required as this was deemed physiological.

tricuspid_insufficiency_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe functional tricuspid insufficiency secondary to pulmonary hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Progressive exertional dyspnoea and bilateral ankle oedema
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with long-standing COPD presented with worsening breathlessness. Echocardiography revealed severe TR with annular dilatation, secondary to a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 65 mmHg. Management focused on optimising COPD therapy and aggressive diuresis with furosemide and spironolactone.

tricuspid_insufficiency_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute infective endocarditis of the tricuspid valve
  presenting_complaint: High fever, rigors, and pleuritic chest pain
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old male intravenous drug user presented with sepsis and multiple septic pulmonary emboli on CT. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) identified a 1.5cm mobile vegetation on the anterior leaflet causing acute severe tricuspid insufficiency. He was started on long-term IV flucloxacillin and gentamicin, eventually requiring valve replacement due to refractory heart failure.

tricuspid_insufficiency_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Ebstein's anomaly with severe tricuspid insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Cyanosis and poor feeding in a neonate
  summary_of_course: A 2-day-old neonate exhibited central cyanosis and a loud systolic murmur. Echocardiography confirmed apical displacement of the septal tricuspid leaflet and a "atrialised" right ventricle, resulting in massive TR. The infant was stabilised with prostaglandin E1 and referred for urgent surgical Cone reconstruction.

tricuspid_insufficiency_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic rheumatic tricuspid insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue, abdominal bloating, and palpitations
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female originally from India presented with signs of multi-valvular disease. Investigations confirmed rheumatic heart disease with mitral stenosis and moderate tricuspid insufficiency characterised by leaflet thickening and restricted motion. She underwent a double valve replacement (mitral and tricuspid) with mechanical prostheses.

tricuspid_insufficiency_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic tricuspid insufficiency post-pacemaker lead insertion
  presenting_complaint: New-onset peripheral oedema and raised JVP three months post-procedure
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male developed right-sided heart failure symptoms following a dual-chamber pacemaker insertion. Echo demonstrated a ventricular lead impinging on the septal leaflet, preventing coaptation and causing moderate-to-severe TR. The lead was repositioned percutaneously, resulting in significant reduction of the regurgitant jet and symptom resolution.

tricuspid_insufficiency_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Carcinoid heart disease causing severe tricuspid insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Episodic flushing, diarrhoea, and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male with a known midgut neuroendocrine tumour presented with progressive right heart failure. Echo showed classic "frozen" tricuspid leaflets in a semi-open position due to fibrous plaque deposition, causing severe TR. He was managed with somatostatin analogues and scheduled for tricuspid valve replacement once the systemic disease was stabilised.

tricuspid_insufficiency_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic tricuspid insufficiency in atrial fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Rapid palpitations and sudden worsening of ascites
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old female with chronic permanent AF and mild TR presented with fast ventricular rate and decompensated right failure. The loss of atrial kick and tachycardia-induced annular dilatation worsened the TR to a severe grade. Heart rate control with digoxin and IV diuretics successfully transitioned her back to her baseline compensated state.

tricuspid_insufficiency_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Traumatic tricuspid valve rupture
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset chest pain and dyspnoea following a road traffic accident
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male sustained blunt chest trauma against a steering wheel. Initial CT was clear, but subsequent echocardiography for a new systolic murmur revealed a ruptured chordae tendineae of the tricuspid valve leading to acute severe insufficiency. He underwent successful primary surgical repair of the flail leaflet.

tricuspid_insufficiency_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe tricuspid insufficiency secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, and global oedema
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with non-ischaemic DCM (LVEF 20%) presented in the ICU with cardiogenic shock. Severe functional TR was noted due to massive RV dilatation and papillary muscle tethering. He was managed with inotropes, IV diuretics, and eventually evaluated for a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) with concurrent tricuspid annuloplasty.

tricuspid_insufficiency_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate tricuspid insufficiency post-endomyocardial biopsy
  presenting_complaint: Routine follow-up post-heart transplant; asymptomatic
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male heart transplant recipient underwent surveillance biopsies. Serial echocardiograms showed the development of moderate TR, likely due to inadvertent chordal damage during bioptome sampling. As he remained asymptomatic with stable RV function, he was managed conservatively with close echocardiographic monitoring.

tricuspid_insufficiency_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Torrential tricuspid insufficiency with "giant V-waves"
  presenting_complaint: Pulsatile neck veins and a "thumping" sensation in the abdomen
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old female presented with visible venous pulsations in her neck. Examination revealed a pulsatile liver and prominent V-waves in the JVP; echo confirmed "torrential" TR with a massive coaptation gap. Due to her frailty and high surgical risk, she was treated with high-dose loop diuretics and considered for transcatheter tricuspid valve intervention (TTVR).

tricuspid_insufficiency_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Late tricuspid insufficiency following mitral valve replacement
  presenting_complaint: Progressive fatigue and hepatomegaly five years post-surgery
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male who had a successful mechanical mitral valve replacement previously now presented with right-sided failure. Investigations showed severe functional TR despite a well-functioning mitral prosthesis, a common late complication. He was managed with a percutaneous edge-to-edge tricuspid repair (TriClip) as a redo sternotomy was deemed high-risk.

tricuspid_insufficiency_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe tricuspid insufficiency associated with an Atrial Septal Defect (ASD)
  presenting_complaint: Exertional breathlessness and recurrent chest infections
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female was diagnosed with a large secundum ASD. The resulting chronic right ventricular volume overload led to annular stretching and severe secondary tricuspid insufficiency. She underwent surgical ASD closure and tricuspid annuloplasty, with complete recovery of RV dimensions at 6-month follow-up.

tricuspid_insufficiency_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening acute tricuspid insufficiency in massive pulmonary embolism
  presenting_complaint: Sudden collapse, hypotension, and severe hypoxia
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female presented to A&E with a saddle PE. The acute rise in pulmonary vascular resistance caused massive RV distension and acute severe functional TR, leading to obstructive shock. Following successful thrombolysis with alteplase, the RV size normalised and the TR regressed to a trace level within 48 hours.

tricuspid_insufficiency_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary myxomatous tricuspid valve disease
  presenting_complaint: Incidental murmur found during pre-operative assessment
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male scheduled for hernia repair was found to have a pansystolic murmur. Echo showed myxomatous degeneration of the tricuspid valve with prolapse of the posterior leaflet and moderate TR. Since he was asymptomatic with normal RV function, he was cleared for surgery with a plan for annual cardiology review.

tricuspid_insufficiency_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Libman-Sacks endocarditis causing tricuspid insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Joint pain, malar rash, and new-onset breathlessness
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) presented with an exacerbation. Echo revealed small, sterile vegetations on the atrial surface of the tricuspid valve causing moderate regurgitation. Symptoms improved significantly after escalating immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil.

tricuspid_insufficiency_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe tricuspid insufficiency in end-stage liver disease
  presenting_complaint: Refractory ascites and jaundice
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis and portal hypertension was evaluated for liver transplantation. He was found to have severe functional TR driven by a high-output state and chronic volume overload. His management was complicated by hepatorenal syndrome, and he was managed with cautious diuresis while awaiting a combined transplant evaluation.

tricuspid_insufficiency_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate tricuspid insufficiency secondary to radiation-induced heart disease
  presenting_complaint: Chronic dry cough and exertional dyspnoea
  summary_of_course: A 47-year-old female, who received mediastinal radiotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma 15 years ago, presented with restrictive physiology. Echo showed thickened, calcified tricuspid leaflets and moderate TR, alongside pericardial thickening. Management was focused on symptom control as the multi-level radiation damage made surgical intervention highly complex.

tricuspid_insufficiency_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Failed tricuspid annuloplasty with recurrent severe insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent hospitalisations for decompensated heart failure
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female who underwent tricuspid ring annuloplasty two years prior presented with recurrent severe TR. Imaging showed "ring dehiscence" at the septal attachment site. Given her multiple comorbidities, she was successfully treated with a "valve-in-ring" procedure using a transcatheter bioprosthesis.
