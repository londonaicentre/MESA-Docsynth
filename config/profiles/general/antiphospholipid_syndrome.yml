antiphospholipid_syndrome_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Obstetric Antiphospholipid Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent second-trimester pregnancy loss
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female presented following her third consecutive miscarriage at 14 weeks gestation. Investigations revealed persistent triple positivity for lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin, and anti-beta-2-glycoprotein I antibodies. She was commenced on low-dose aspirin and prophylactic-dose LMWH for her subsequent pregnancy, which resulted in a successful live birth at 37 weeks.

antiphospholipid_syndrome_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome (CAPS)
  presenting_complaint: Acute multi-organ failure and widespread purpura
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with known primary APS was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress, renal failure, and encephalopathy following a minor surgical procedure. Biopsies confirmed microvascular thrombosis in multiple organs, and he was treated aggressively with pulsed methylprednisolone, plasma exchange, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). Despite the life-threatening presentation, he survived with residual stage 3 chronic kidney disease.

antiphospholipid_syndrome_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary Antiphospholipid Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Swollen, painful left calf and shortness of breath
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old male presented with a provoked DVT and subsequent segmental pulmonary embolism. Thrombophilia screening, performed 12 weeks apart, confirmed persistent lupus anticoagulant positivity in the absence of other autoimmune features. He was transitioned from LMWH to long-term warfarin therapy with a target INR of 2.5.

  primary_diagnosis: Secondary Antiphospholipid Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset right-sided weakness and facial droop
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female with a 10-year history of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) presented with an acute ischaemic stroke. MRI brain confirmed a left middle cerebral artery territory infarct, and serology showed high-titre IgG anti-cardiolipin antibodies. Her management required the addition of lifelong anticoagulation to her existing immunosuppressive regimen for SLE.

antiphospholipid_syndrome_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Antiphospholipid Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Involuntary jerky movements of the limbs (chorea)
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old girl presented with sudden onset Sydenham-like chorea and livedo reticularis. Extensive workup ruled out rheumatic fever but identified high-titre anti-beta-2-glycoprotein I antibodies. She was treated with low-dose aspirin and a short course of corticosteroids, resulting in complete resolution of neurological symptoms within six weeks.

antiphospholipid_syndrome_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Antiphospholipid Syndrome with Adrenal Haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal pain, hypotension, and vomiting
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male presented in acute Addisonian crisis with bilateral adrenal haemorrhage noted on CT imaging. Subsequent testing revealed the presence of lupus anticoagulant, leading to a diagnosis of APS as the underlying cause of adrenal vein thrombosis. He now requires lifelong hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone replacement alongside warfarin anticoagulation.

antiphospholipid_syndrome_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary Antiphospholipid Syndrome (Budd-Chiari Syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal distension and jaundice
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female presented with acute onset ascites and hepatomegaly. Imaging confirmed hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd-Chiari syndrome), and subsequent serology was positive for triple antiphospholipid antibodies. She underwent successful radiological decompression with a TIPS procedure and was commenced on long-term anticoagulation.

antiphospholipid_syndrome_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Antiphospholipid Syndrome with Libman-Sacks Endocarditis
  presenting_complaint: Fever, malaise, and a new heart murmur
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female with known APS presented with symptoms mimicking infective endocarditis. Echocardiography revealed sterile vegetations on the mitral valve consistent with Libman-Sacks endocarditis, and blood cultures remained negative. Her anticoagulation was optimised, and she was monitored closely for valvular dysfunction, eventually requiring a valve repair.

antiphospholipid_syndrome_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Antiphospholipid Syndrome with Renal Artery Thrombosis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset loin pain and refractory hypertension
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male athlete presented with acute left-sided loin pain and a blood pressure of 190/110 mmHg. CT angiography demonstrated a left renal artery thrombosis, and thrombophilia screening confirmed APS. He was treated with thrombolysis and long-term warfarin, with subsequent improvement in renal function and blood pressure control.

antiphospholipid_syndrome_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Antiphospholipid Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent DVT despite therapeutic warfarin
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female with established APS experienced a breakthrough popliteal DVT while her INR was stable at 2.8. Due to treatment failure on standard warfarin, her target INR was increased to 3.5, and low-dose aspirin was added. She has remained free of further thrombotic events for 24 months under this intensified regimen.

antiphospholipid_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Non-thrombotic Antiphospholipid Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Chronic migraines and livedo reticularis
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female presented to dermatology with persistent mottled skin (livedo reticularis) and a history of frequent, severe migraines. While she had no history of major thrombosis, her serology showed persistent moderate-titre anti-cardiolipin antibodies. She was managed conservatively with low-dose aspirin and smoking cessation advice, with no thrombotic events at 5-year follow-up.

antiphospholipid_syndrome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Antiphospholipid Syndrome with Mesenteric Ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Severe post-prandial abdominal pain and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented with "abdominal angina" and significant unintentional weight loss. Mesenteric angiography revealed thrombosis of the superior mesenteric artery, and APS was confirmed through serial antibody testing. Following surgical revascularisation and commencement of anticoagulation, his symptoms resolved and he regained weight.

antiphospholipid_syndrome_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Antiphospholipid Syndrome with Retinal Vein Occlusion
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, painless loss of vision in the right eye
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female presented with a central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). Given her young age and lack of cardiovascular risk factors, an autoimmune screen was performed, revealing high-titre anti-beta-2-glycoprotein I antibodies. She received intravitreal injections for macular oedema and was started on long-term systemic anticoagulation.

antiphospholipid_syndrome_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Antiphospholipid Syndrome with Cognitive Impairment
  presenting_complaint: Progressive memory loss and gait instability
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male presented with subacute cognitive decline and frequent falls. MRI showed extensive small vessel ischaemic changes and multiple old lacunar infarcts, while serology confirmed persistent lupus anticoagulant. His presentation was attributed to APS-related small vessel disease, and he was started on anticoagulation to prevent further vascular cognitive impairment.

antiphospholipid_syndrome_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Obstetric Antiphospholipid Syndrome (HELLP-like)
  presenting_complaint: Severe pre-eclampsia and low platelets at 26 weeks gestation
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old primigravida presented with severe hypertension, proteinuria, and thrombocytopenia. Following an emergency Caesarean section, she developed a postpartum DVT, and subsequent testing confirmed triple-positive APS. This case highlights the overlap between severe obstetric complications and the prothrombotic state of APS.

antiphospholipid_syndrome_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Antiphospholipid Syndrome (Post-traumatic)
  presenting_complaint: Extensive leg swelling following a minor sports injury
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old boy developed a massive iliofemoral DVT after a minor blunt trauma to his thigh during football. Investigations revealed no inherited thrombophilia but showed persistent high-titre anti-cardiolipin antibodies. He was treated with six months of anticoagulation initially but remained on long-term therapy due to the high risk of recurrence associated with his antibody profile.

antiphospholipid_syndrome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Antiphospholipid Syndrome with Skin Ulceration
  presenting_complaint: Chronic, non-healing ulcers on the lower malleoli
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female presented with painful, punched-out ulcers on her ankles that failed to respond to standard compression therapy. Skin biopsy showed livedoid vasculopathy with microvascular thrombi, and APS serology was strongly positive. Her ulcers finally began to heal after the introduction of therapeutic anticoagulation and iloprost infusions.

antiphospholipid_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic Triple-Positive Antiphospholipid Profile
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of prolonged APTT during pre-operative screen
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male undergoing routine screening for elective hernia repair was found to have an isolated prolonged APTT that did not correct with a mixing study. Further testing confirmed triple positivity for APS antibodies despite no history of thrombosis or miscarriage. He was started on primary prophylaxis with low-dose aspirin and advised on strict cardiovascular risk factor management.

antiphospholipid_syndrome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Antiphospholipid Syndrome with Evans Syndrome Overlap
  presenting_complaint: Easy bruising, petechiae, and profound fatigue
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female presented with autoimmune haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia (Evans Syndrome). During her workup, she was also found to be positive for lupus anticoagulant and anti-cardiolipin antibodies. She later developed a DVT, confirming a diagnosis of APS and requiring a complex balance of immunosuppression for her cytopenias and anticoagulation for her thrombosis.

antiphospholipid_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Antiphospholipid Syndrome with Transverse Myelitis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset lower limb weakness and sensory level at T10
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented with acute longitudinal extensive transverse myelitis (LETM). While initial suspicion focused on multiple sclerosis, her APS screen returned strongly positive, and MRI showed no intracranial lesions. She was treated with high-dose steroids and cyclophosphamide for the inflammatory component, alongside long-term anticoagulation to prevent further neurovascular events.
