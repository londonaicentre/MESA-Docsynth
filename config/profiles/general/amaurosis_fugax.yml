He underwent an urgent right carotid endarterectomy and was commenced on dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin.

amaurosis_fugax_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Giant Cell Arteritis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden blurring and transient loss of vision in the left eye with associated scalp tenderness.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old female presented with subacute temporal headaches and jaw claudication. Elevated ESR (92 mm/hr) and CRP (45 mg/L) raised suspicion of vasculitis, and she was immediately started on high-dose IV methylprednisolone. Temporal artery biopsy confirmed the diagnosis, preventing permanent visual deficit.

amaurosis_fugax_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Retinal Migraine
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of total vision loss in the left eye lasting 15 minutes followed by a throbbing headache.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female with a history of migraine with aura reported three episodes of monocular vision loss over two months. Extensive cardiovascular workup, including MRI and echocardiogram, was unremarkable. She was diagnosed with retinal migraine and started on propranolol prophylaxis, resulting in a significant reduction in episode frequency.

  primary_diagnosis: Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Brief episode of "shimmering" vision loss in the right eye and palpitations.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male presented to A&E with acute amaurosis fugax. While initial ECG was normal, a 24-hour Holter monitor detected paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He was anticoagulated with apixaban for stroke prevention, with no further visual episodes reported at six-month follow-up.

amaurosis_fugax_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)
  presenting_complaint: Acute, profound, and persistent vision loss in the right eye following multiple transient episodes.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with poorly controlled hypertension ignored several "warning" 2-minute visual dimming events. He presented with permanent loss of vision; fundoscopy revealed a "cherry-red spot" and retinal whitening. Despite ocular massage and acetazolamide, visual recovery was minimal due to the delayed presentation.

amaurosis_fugax_006:

  primary_diagnosis: Calcific Embolism from Aortic Stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Single episode of sudden, painless loss of the upper visual field in the left eye.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old female with a known systolic murmur presented with a transient altitudinal defect. Dilated fundoscopy revealed a bright, white calcific embolus at a bifurcation of the retinal artery. Echocardiography confirmed severe calcific aortic stenosis, and she was referred for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).

amaurosis_fugax_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Cardiac Myxoma
  presenting_complaint: Sudden transient blindness in a child with associated lethargy.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy presented with two episodes of amaurosis fugax in the right eye. Physical examination revealed a "tumour plop" on auscultation, and an urgent echocardiogram identified a large left atrial myxoma. The tumour was surgically excised, and the patient had no further neurological or visual complications.

amaurosis_fugax_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Antiphospholipid Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent transient monocular vision loss and a history of deep vein thrombosis.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female with three previous first-trimester miscarriages presented with acute amaurosis fugax. Laboratory testing confirmed the presence of lupus anticoagulant and high-titre anticardiolipin antibodies. She was started on lifelong warfarin therapy with a target INR of 2.5, which successfully halted the visual episodes.

amaurosis_fugax_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Cholesterol Embolism (Hollenhorst Plaque)
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic bright yellow spot in the retinal artery found during a routine eye exam after a brief "grey out" last week.
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old male with hypercholesterolaemia and hypertension presented for a routine check-up. Optometry identified a Hollenhorst plaque in the right retina; subsequent carotid imaging showed a small ulcerated plaque at the carotid bulb. His statin dose was increased, and he was started on clopidogrel to reduce the risk of future embolic stroke.

amaurosis_fugax_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Exercise-Induced Retinal Vasospasm
  presenting_complaint: Transient monocular vision loss occurring only during intense physical exertion.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old marathon runner reported five episodes of total vision loss in the left eye, always occurring at the 10-mile mark. Cardiovascular and carotid investigations were entirely normal. A diagnosis of exercise-induced vasospasm was made, and the episodes ceased following the introduction of a low-dose calcium channel blocker (nifedipine).

amaurosis_fugax_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Crescendo TIA
  presenting_complaint: Multiple episodes of right-sided vision loss occurring several times a day.
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old male was admitted to the stroke unit with "stuttering" amaurosis fugax. Urgent CTA showed a "string sign" indicating near-total occlusion of the right internal carotid artery. He was fast-tracked for carotid endarterectomy within 24 hours to prevent a major hemispheric stroke.

amaurosis_fugax_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Polycythaemia Vera
  presenting_complaint: Transient visual blurring and a "fullness" in the head, with a ruddy complexion.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented with recurrent bilateral but asymmetric transient visual obscurations. Full blood count showed a haematocrit of 0.58 and a positive JAK2 mutation. He was treated with venesection and hydroxycarbamide to reduce blood viscosity, which resolved his visual symptoms.

amaurosis_fugax_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Infective Endocarditis
  presenting_complaint: Fever, malaise, and a sudden episode of transient monocular vision loss.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old intravenous drug user presented with acute amaurosis fugax and a temperature of 38.5°C. Blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus, and transoesophageal echo showed vegetations on the mitral valve. He was treated with a 6-week course of IV antibiotics for septic emboli.

amaurosis_fugax_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Vasculitis
  presenting_complaint: Transient vision loss in a young woman with joint pains and a malar rash.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old female presented with subacute visual disturbances and systemic symptoms. Fundus fluorescein angiography showed areas of retinal capillary non-perfusion and perivascular staining. She was diagnosed with SLE-related retinal vasculitis and responded well to systemic immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil.

amaurosis_fugax_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Preeclampsia
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, transient "greying" of vision in the third trimester of pregnancy.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant female at 34 weeks gestation presented with amaurosis fugax and a severe headache. Her blood pressure was 175/110 mmHg with 3+ proteinuria on dipstick. She was diagnosed with severe preeclampsia and underwent urgent induction of labour following stabilisation with magnesium sulphate and labetalol.

amaurosis_fugax_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic Retinal Vasospasm
  presenting_complaint: Frequent, short-lived episodes of monocular vision loss without identifiable triggers.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old female with no cardiovascular risk factors experienced dozens of 30-second episodes of amaurosis. Extensive neuro-ophthalmological workup, including thrombophilia screens and cardiac monitoring, was negative. The condition was attributed to idiopathic vasospasm; however, she remained refractory to various vasodilators, representing a significant treatment challenge.

amaurosis_fugax_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Fibromuscular Dysplasia (FMD)
  presenting_complaint: Transient monocular blindness and pulsatile tinnitus in a middle-aged female.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female with resistant hypertension presented with amaurosis fugax. Catheter angiography revealed a "string of beads" appearance in both the carotid and renal arteries. She was managed conservatively with antiplatelet therapy and strict blood pressure control, with no progression to stroke over a 3-year period.

amaurosis_fugax_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic Embolism
  presenting_complaint: Immediate loss of vision in the left eye during a cerebral angiogram.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male underwent diagnostic angiography for an intracranial aneurysm.
