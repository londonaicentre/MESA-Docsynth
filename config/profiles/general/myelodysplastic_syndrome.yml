  presenting_complaint: Painful, erythematous skin plaques and high-grade fever.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old female presented to dermatology with a biopsy-confirmed neutrophilic dermatosis. Subsequent FBC showed unexplained macrocytic anaemia and neutropenia. BMA confirmed MDS with multilineage dysplasia; her cutaneous symptoms responded well to systemic corticosteroids alongside MDS management.

myelodysplastic_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: MDS with multilineage dysplasia (MDS-MLD)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic fatigue in the context of multiple comorbidities.
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old male with heart failure and stage 4 CKD presented with Hb 75g/L. Investigations confirmed MDS-MLD with a normal karyotype. Due to his frailty, he is managed in the community with monthly Erythropoietin injections and restrictive transfusion triggers.

myelodysplastic_syndrome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: MDS with isolated del(20q)
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic mild thrombocytopenia.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female was found to have a stable platelet count of 90-100 x 10^9/L over two years. BMA performed due to a slight drop in Hb showed del(20q) in 50% of metaphases. This is considered a low-risk MDS variant, and she remains under outpatient surveillance without intervention.

  primary_diagnosis: MDS in a patient with Fanconi Anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Progressive marrow failure in young adulthood.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female with known Fanconi Anaemia developed new-onset monocytosis and excess blasts (6%) on BMA. This indicated transformation to MDS. She underwent a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic transplant, which is complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

myelodysplastic_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: MDS-EB2 failing Azacitidine
  presenting_complaint: Increasing breathlessness and peripheral blasts on blood film.
  summary_of_course: A 73-year-old male with MDS-EB2 completed six cycles of Azacitidine with no haematological response. Repeat BMA showed blasts had increased from 12% to 19%, nearing the threshold for AML transformation. After a multidisciplinary team discussion, the focus of care was shifted to symptom-led palliative management.
