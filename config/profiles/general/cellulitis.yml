  presenting_complaint: Rigors, high fever, and painful left leg swelling.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with type 2 diabetes presented with a temperature of 39.1°C and tachycardia. The left lower limb showed extensive, confluent erythema extending to the mid-thigh with associated lymphangitis. He was treated with IV flucloxacillin and benzylpenicillin, requiring a 5-day hospital stay for clinical stabilisation and glycaemic control.

cellulitis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent cellulitis secondary to chronic lymphoedema
  presenting_complaint: Acute-on-chronic swelling and redness of the bilateral lower limbs.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old female with a history of breast cancer and pelvic radiotherapy presented with worsening bilateral leg redness. This was her third episode in 12 months, complicated by chronic lymphoedema and skin thickening. Following acute treatment with IV antibiotics, she was commenced on long-term prophylactic phenoxymethylpenicillin.

cellulitis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis
  presenting_complaint: Painful eye movement, proptosis, and reduced visual acuity.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old male with recent sinusitis presented with severe retro-orbital pain and chemosis. Urgent CT imaging confirmed post-septal involvement and a small subperiosteal abscess. He underwent emergency surgical drainage by the ENT and ophthalmology teams and received 14 days of high-dose IV antibiotics.

cellulitis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Erysipelas
  presenting_complaint: Sharply demarcated, bright red rash on the right cheek.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented with a rapid-onset, painful facial rash and malaise. Examination revealed a raised, well-defined erythematous plaque involving the ear (Milian's ear sign), characteristic of superficial cellulitis. She responded well to high-dose oral phenoxymethylpenicillin over 10 days.

cellulitis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Cellulitis with associated abscess formation
  presenting_complaint: Localised fluctuant swelling within an area of spreading erythema on the forearm.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old intravenous drug user presented with a painful, erythematous mass at an injection site. Ultrasound confirmed a 3cm subcutaneous abscess surrounded by extensive cellulitis. Treatment involved incision and drainage under local anaesthetic followed by a course of oral clindamycin to cover for potential MRSA.

cellulitis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Necrotising fasciitis (initially presenting as cellulitis)
  presenting_complaint: Pain out of proportion to clinical signs in the left groin.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male presented with rapidly spreading erythema and severe pain. Despite initially appearing as simple cellulitis, he quickly developed skin blistering, crepitus, and septic shock (BP 85/50 mmHg). He was rushed to theatre for emergency debridement where necrotic fascia was confirmed, requiring ICU admission and multi-organ support.

cellulitis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Bullous cellulitis
  presenting_complaint: Redness of the lower leg with large fluid-filled blisters.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with venous insufficiency presented with acute erythema and large, tense bullae on the pretibial surface. Swabs grew Staphylococcus aureus; he was treated with IV flucloxacillin and topical dressings. The blisters were managed conservatively, and the infection resolved with some residual post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.

cellulitis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Pasteurella multocida cellulitis
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressing hand swelling following a cat bite.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female presented only 6 hours after a feline bite with intense pain and spreading redness. Given the high risk of Pasteurella infection, she was started on oral co-amoxiclav. The infection was caught early, preventing the development of tenosynovitis or osteomyelitis.

cellulitis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Cellulitis secondary to tinea pedis
  presenting_complaint: Itchy, peeling skin between toes followed by painful calf swelling.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male presented with typical features of lower limb cellulitis. Examination revealed interdigital maceration and fungal infection, which served as the portal of entry for bacteria. Management included oral antibiotics for the cellulitis and topical terbinafine to treat the underlying tinea pedis and prevent recurrence.

cellulitis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Neutropenic cellulitis
  presenting_complaint: Fever and a faint, painful erythematous patch on the thigh.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female undergoing chemotherapy for lymphoma presented with a neutrophil count of 0.2 x 10^9/L. Despite minimal local signs, her fever and localized tenderness indicated cellulitis in an immunocompromised host. She was treated urgently with IV tazocin and gentamicin according to the neutropenic sepsis protocol.

cellulitis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Perianal streptococcal cellulitis
  presenting_complaint: Intense perianal redness and painful defecation.
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old boy presented with a bright red, well-demarcated perianal rash that had been mistaken for nappy rash. A perianal swab was positive for Group A Streptococcus. He was successfully treated with a 10-day course of oral phenoxymethylpenicillin, with rapid improvement in symptoms.

cellulitis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: MRSA cellulitis
  presenting_complaint: Non-healing, purulent skin infection on the lower back.
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old male recently discharged from the hospital presented with spreading erythema around a previous drain site. Initial treatment with flucloxacillin failed to show improvement. Wound cultures confirmed Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and the antibiotic was switched to oral doxycycline, leading to resolution.

cellulitis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Breast cellulitis
  presenting_complaint: Redness, heat, and heaviness in the left breast.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female, three years post-mastectomy and radiotherapy, presented with acute inflammatory changes in the reconstructed breast. Differential diagnosis included inflammatory breast cancer, but the rapid onset and elevated CRP (88 mg/L) favoured cellulitis. She responded to IV antibiotics, though imaging was performed to rule out underlying malignancy.

cellulitis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Cellulitis in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Painful, red swelling of the right ankle at 32 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old pregnant female presented with cellulitis likely triggered by pregnancy-associated peripheral oedema. Due to her pregnancy status, she was admitted for observation and treated with IV cephalexin, which is considered safe in the third trimester. Obstetric review confirmed foetal wellbeing throughout the admission.

cellulitis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Cryptococcal cellulitis (Opportunistic infection)
  presenting_complaint: Unusual, nodular erythematous lesions on the forearm.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male with advanced HIV (CD4 count <50) presented with atypical cellulitis that did not respond to standard antibacterials. A skin biopsy revealed fungal hyphae, and cultures grew Cryptococcus neoformans. He required systemic antifungal therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosine.

cellulitis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Water-borne cellulitis (Aeromonas hydrophila)
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly spreading infection after a laceration in a freshwater lake.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male presented with severe cellulitis of the foot 24 hours after swimming in a lake. Given the exposure, antibiotics were chosen to cover Gram-negative organisms (ciprofloxacin). The infection was aggressive but responded well to the targeted antimicrobial therapy.

cellulitis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic stasis dermatitis with superimposed cellulitis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic leg redness with a new area of acute pain and warmth.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with long-standing venous ulcers and stasis dermatitis presented with a change in his baseline skin condition. Distinguishing between the two was challenging, but unilateral worsening, increased warmth, and a CRP of 60 mg/L confirmed acute-on-chronic cellulitis. He was treated with antibiotics and improved leg elevation.

cellulitis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Abdominal wall cellulitis
  presenting_complaint: Erythema and tenderness within the skin folds of the abdomen.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old morbidly obese male presented with intertriginous cellulitis. The infection was exacerbated by moisture and friction within the abdominal panniculus. Treatment required systemic antibiotics and the introduction of topical antifungal/barrier creams to manage the underlying intertrigo and prevent recurrence.
