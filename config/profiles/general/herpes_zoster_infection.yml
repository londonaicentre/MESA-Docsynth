  presenting_complaint: Persistent, stabbing pain six months after a shingles rash.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female reported debilitating allodynia and lancinating pain in the L2 dermatome where a zoster rash had healed half a year prior.

  presenting_complaint: Confusion, headache, and a resolving rash on the neck.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male was admitted to the ICU with a reduced Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and fever, one week after a cervical zoster eruption. Lumbar puncture showed a lymphocytic pleocytosis and VZV PCR positivity. He responded well to a 14-day course of intravenous aciclovir, though he retained mild cognitive deficits at discharge.

herpes_zoster_infection_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Herpes Zoster with Secondary Bacterial Infection
  presenting_complaint: Purulent discharge and increasing redness around a shingles rash.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old female with Type 2 diabetes presented with a thoracic zoster rash that had become increasingly painful and malodorous. Clinical examination showed surrounding cellulitis and honey-coloured crusting. Swabs grew Staphylococcus aureus, requiring a course of oral flucloxacillin alongside her antiviral therapy.

herpes_zoster_infection_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Segmental Motor Zoster (Zoster Paresis)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden weakness in the right arm following a rash.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male developed significant weakness in his right deltoid and biceps (C5-C6) three days after the onset of a vesicular rash in the same distribution. Electromyography confirmed acute denervation. While the rash healed quickly with aciclovir, the motor deficit required six months of intensive physiotherapy for partial recovery.

herpes_zoster_infection_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Sacral Herpes Zoster with Neurogenic Bladder
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty passing urine and a rash on the buttock.
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old female presented with acute urinary retention and a vesicular eruption over the S3 dermatome. Catheterisation was required, and she was started on intravenous aciclovir. Her bladder function gradually returned to normal over four weeks as the sacral nerve inflammation subsided.

herpes_zoster_infection_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent Herpes Zoster
  presenting_complaint: Third episode of shingles in two years.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male presented with a recurrent T12 dermatomal rash. Given the unusual frequency of recurrence in a young patient, an underlying immunodeficiency screen was performed. This led to a new diagnosis of HIV (CD4 count 210 cells/uL), and he was commenced on both antivirals and antiretroviral therapy (ART).

herpes_zoster_infection_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Necrotising Herpes Zoster
  presenting_complaint: Deep, painful ulcers on the lower back.
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old frail male presented with a severe, necrotic VZV eruption in the L4 distribution. The lesions failed to crust normally and progressed to deep tissue ulceration. He required hospital admission for wound debridement, IV aciclovir, and nutritional support, resulting in significant scarring.

herpes_zoster_infection_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Herpes Zoster in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Painful rash on the flank during the second trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old pregnant woman (24 weeks gestation) presented with a localized T11 zoster rash.

  primary_diagnosis: VZV Vasculopathy (Post-Zoster Stroke)
  presenting_complaint: Left-sided weakness two months after shingles.
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old male presented with acute hemiparesis. History revealed a severe episode of right-sided HZO eight weeks prior. MRI Brain showed an ischaemic infarct, and CSF analysis confirmed VZV vasculopathy. He was treated with a prolonged course of IV aciclovir and steroids to prevent further vascular events.

herpes_zoster_infection_016:

  presenting_complaint: Dark, blood-filled blisters on the thigh.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male on long-term warfarin for atrial fibrillation presented with haemorrhagic vesicles in an L3 distribution. Despite the alarming appearance, there was no systemic involvement or thrombocytopaenia. Antiviral treatment was successful, though healing was delayed compared to non-haemorrhagic presentations.

herpes_zoster_infection_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Herpes Zoster Duplex Bilateralis
  presenting_complaint: Painful rashes on both sides of the chest.
  summary_of_course: A 73-year-old female presented with simultaneous, non-contiguous vesicular eruptions on both the left T3 and right T8 dermatomes. This rare bilateral presentation prompted an investigation for occult malignancy, which was negative. She responded well to standard dose valaciclovir with no long-term sequelae.

herpes_zoster_infection_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Cutaneous Herpes Zoster
  presenting_complaint: Non-healing, verrucous lesions on the arm.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male with advanced AIDS presented with persistent, wart-like lesions on his left forearm that had been present for three months. Biopsy and PCR confirmed VZV. The lesions were resistant to aciclovir due to viral thymidine kinase mutations, necessitating treatment with intravenous foscarnet.

herpes_zoster_infection_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Herpes Zoster Laryngitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe hoarseness and throat pain.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female presented with odynophagia and dysphonia. Laryngoscopy revealed unilateral vesicles on the epiglottis and vocal cords. No external rash was visible initially, but a small cluster of vesicles appeared behind the ear two days later. Symptoms improved rapidly with oral famciclovir.

herpes_zoster_infection_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Visceral Disseminated Zoster
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal pain followed by a faint rash.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old renal transplant recipient presented with acute "surgical" abdominal pain and elevated liver enzymes (ALT 850 U/L). Three days later, a sparse vesicular rash appeared on his trunk. VZV PCR in the blood was highly positive, confirming visceral dissemination (zoster hepatitis); he required urgent ICU stabilisation and IV aciclovir.
