testicular_torsion_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute testicular torsion
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset severe left scrotal pain and nausea
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old male presented with a 3-hour history of agonising scrotal pain and vomiting. Examination revealed a high-riding, transverse left testis with absent cremasteric reflex and significant oedema. Emergency scrotal exploration confirmed a 720-degree clockwise torsion; the testis was salvaged following detorsion and bilateral orchidopexy.

testicular_torsion_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Neonatal extravaginal testicular torsion
  presenting_complaint: Firm, discoloured right scrotal mass at birth
  summary_of_course: A full-term neonate was noted to have a painless, dusky, and firm right hemiscrotum during the initial newborn examination. Urgent ultrasound suggested absent vascularity, and surgical exploration confirmed an antenatal extravaginal torsion. A right orchidectomy was performed due to total necrosis, followed by contralateral orchidopexy to prevent future torsion.

testicular_torsion_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Intermittent testicular torsion
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of self-limiting scrotal pain
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male reported three previous episodes of acute, severe right scrotal pain that resolved spontaneously within an hour. Clinical examination between episodes was unremarkable, but elective scrotal exploration revealed a "bell-clapper" deformity. Prophylactic bilateral orchidopexy was performed to prevent a permanent ischaemic event.

testicular_torsion_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Missed testicular torsion
  presenting_complaint: Swollen, painless left scrotum for 48 hours
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male presented late after initially ignoring scrotal discomfort that began two days prior. Examination showed a hard, non-tender, swollen left testis with overlying skin erythema. Exploration confirmed a necrotic, non-viable testis which required a left orchidectomy.

testicular_torsion_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Torsion of undescended testis
  presenting_complaint: Right-sided lower abdominal pain and empty scrotum
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy with a known history of cryptorchidism presented with acute right iliac fossa pain and vomiting. Physical exam revealed an empty right scrotum and a tender, palpable mass in the inguinal canal. Urgent surgery confirmed torsion of the inguinal testis, which was detorted and fixed via orchidopexy.

testicular_torsion_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Traumatic testicular torsion
  presenting_complaint: Acute scrotal pain following a sports injury
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old male experienced sudden onset severe pain after being kicked in the groin during a football match. While initially attributed to trauma, persistent pain and a high-riding testis prompted a Doppler ultrasound which showed absent flow. Surgical exploration confirmed a 360-degree torsion triggered by the traumatic event, successfully salvaged with detorsion.

testicular_torsion_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Partial testicular torsion
  presenting_complaint: Moderate, dull aching in the right scrotum
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male presented with a 12-hour history of moderate right scrotal discomfort rather than acute agony. Ultrasound revealed reduced but not absent arterial flow and a 180-degree twist was suspected. Surgical exploration confirmed a partial torsion, and the testis was salvaged with bilateral orchidopexy.

testicular_torsion_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Testicular torsion in an elderly patient
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset scrotal pain and swelling
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male presented to the ED with acute right-sided scrotal pain, initially suspected to be an incarcerated hernia. Clinical suspicion for torsion remained high despite his age, and urgent exploration revealed a 540-degree torsion. Due to the late presentation and patient age, a right orchidectomy was performed.

testicular_torsion_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent testicular torsion post-orchidopexy
  presenting_complaint: Acute left scrotal pain despite previous surgery
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old male presented with sudden left scrotal pain three years after a previous bilateral orchidopexy. Exploration revealed that the previous sutures had failed, allowing the left testis to rotate again. The testis was detorted, found to be viable, and re-fixed using non-absorbable sutures.

testicular_torsion_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Bilateral bell-clapper deformity with unilateral torsion
  presenting_complaint: Severe right testicular pain and nausea
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy presented with classic signs of right testicular torsion. During emergency surgery, the right testis was detorted, and the surgeon identified a bilateral bell-clapper deformity (lack of normal posterior fixation). Bilateral orchidopexy was performed to secure both testes and prevent future contralateral events.

testicular_torsion_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Testicular torsion misdiagnosed as epididymitis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent scrotal pain and fever
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old male was initially treated in primary care for epididymo-orchitis with oral antibiotics. He presented to the hospital 24 hours later with worsening pain and systemic upset. Scrotal exploration revealed a necrotic testis due to missed torsion, necessitating orchidectomy and drainage of a reactive hydrocele.

testicular_torsion_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Testicular torsion with underlying coagulopathy
  presenting_complaint: Scrotal swelling and pain in a patient with Haemophilia A
  summary_of_course: A 17-year-old male with severe Haemophilia A presented with acute scrotal swelling, initially thought to be a spontaneous haematoma. Because torsion could not be excluded by Doppler, he received factor VIII replacement and underwent urgent exploration. A 360-degree torsion was found and corrected, with careful intraoperative haemostasis.

testicular_torsion_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute testicular torsion
  presenting_complaint: Gradual onset of scrotal swelling over 24 hours
  summary_of_course: A 13-year-old boy presented with a 24-hour history of worsening left scrotal swelling and mild discomfort. Due to the subacute nature, torsion was initially deemed less likely, but absent flow on Doppler led to exploration. A 270-degree torsion was identified; the testis appeared dusky but regained colour after detorsion and warm soaks.

testicular_torsion_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Pre-pubertal testicular torsion
  presenting_complaint: Irritability and scrotal erythema in a 5-year-old
  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old boy was brought to the ED with a 6-hour history of irritability and refusal to walk. Physical examination revealed a swollen, erythematous left scrotum that was extremely tender to touch. Urgent surgery confirmed a 720-degree torsion, which was successfully reduced followed by bilateral pexy.

testicular_torsion_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Testicular torsion with false-normal Doppler
  presenting_complaint: Acute, severe scrotal pain and diaphoresis
  summary_of_course: An 18-year-old male presented with classic torsion symptoms, but an urgent bedside Doppler ultrasound showed preserved arterial flow. Despite the scan, the surgical team proceeded to exploration based on clinical suspicion (absent cremasteric reflex). A 540-degree torsion was found, demonstrating that Doppler flow does not always exclude the diagnosis.

testicular_torsion_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Torsion of the hydatid of Morgagni (Differential)
  presenting_complaint: Localised pain at the upper pole of the testis
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old presented with a 12-hour history of right scrotal pain. Examination revealed a "blue dot sign" at the superior pole and a present cremasteric reflex. While testicular torsion was the primary concern, exploration confirmed torsion of the testicular appendage; the appendage was excised, and the patient made a full recovery.

testicular_torsion_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Neglected testicular torsion with scrotal abscess
  presenting_complaint: Severe scrotal pain, fever, and skin breakdown
  summary_of_course: A 20-year-old male with limited access to healthcare presented five days after the onset of severe scrotal pain. He was septic with a fluctuant, erythematous scrotum and purulent discharge. Surgery revealed a completely liquefied, necrotic testis and a secondary scrotal abscess, requiring orchidectomy and extensive debridement.

testicular_torsion_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Testicular torsion in a non-verbal patient
  presenting_complaint: Acute distress, agitation, and scrotal guarding
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old non-verbal male with severe autism presented with sudden onset agitation and pulling at his groin. Examination under sedation revealed a swollen, tender right testis. Urgent exploration confirmed torsion, which was salvaged; this case highlights the diagnostic challenge in patients with communication barriers.

testicular_torsion_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic testicular torsion
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of long-standing dull scrotal ache
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old reported a dull ache in his right scrotum for several weeks, which suddenly became excruciatingly painful. Exploration revealed evidence of previous minor twisting (scarring and adhesions) with a new 720-degree acute torsion. The testis was salvaged, and bilateral orchidopexy was performed to address the underlying anatomical predisposition.

testicular_torsion_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Spontaneous detorsion of the testis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset pain followed by rapid resolution
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old male presented with a history of sudden, 10/10 scrotal pain that resolved completely just as he arrived at the ED. Ultrasound showed reactive hyperaemia and a horizontal lie of the testis, suggesting spontaneous detorsion. He was admitted for urgent elective orchidopexy the following morning to prevent recurrence.
