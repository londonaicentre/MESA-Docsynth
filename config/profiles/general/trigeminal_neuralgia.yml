  primary_diagnosis: Classical Trigeminal Neuralgia (V2/V3)
  presenting_complaint: Paroxysmal electric-shock-like pain in the right jaw and cheek.
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old female presented with brief, stabbing pain triggered by brushing teeth and eating. MRI showed neurovascular compression of the right trigeminal nerve by the superior cerebellar artery. Commenced on carbamazepine 200mg BD with excellent initial symptomatic relief and no reported side effects.

trigeminal_neuralgia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic Trigeminal Neuralgia (Status Trigeminus)
  presenting_complaint: Refractory, continuous lancinating facial pain and inability to swallow.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with a 10-year history of TN presented to A&E in a state of "status trigeminus," unable to eat or drink due to severe pain triggers. Admitted for IV phenytoin loading and lidocaine infusion under cardiac monitoring. Pain stabilised over 48 hours, and he was referred for urgent neurosurgical review for microvascular decompression.

trigeminal_neuralgia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary Trigeminal Neuralgia (Multiple Sclerosis)
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral episodic facial pain and numbness.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old female with known relapsing-remitting MS presented with new-onset bilateral V2 distribution pain. MRI brain confirmed new demyelinating plaques in the pontine trigeminal nerve entry zone. Symptoms were managed with a combination of gabapentin and a short course of oral methylprednisolone for the MS relapse.

trigeminal_neuralgia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Trigeminal Neuralgia Type 2 (Atypical)
  presenting_complaint: Constant dull ache with superimposed sharp stabs in the left forehead.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female described a persistent burning sensation in the V1 distribution for six months, punctuated by sharp shocks. Unlike classical TN, the background pain was predominant, suggesting Type 2 TN. She showed poor response to carbamazepine but reported moderate improvement with duloxetine and pregabalin.

trigeminal_neuralgia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Trigeminal Neuralgia (V1 Ophthalmic branch)
  presenting_complaint: Severe stabbing pain above the left eye triggered by wind.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male presented with "suicide disease" symptoms specifically affecting the ophthalmic branch. Pain was triggered by cold draughts and touching the eyebrow, leading to significant social isolation. MRI was unremarkable for vascular compression; he was successfully managed with lamotrigine after failing oxcarbazepine due to a rash.

trigeminal_neuralgia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Trigeminal Neuralgia post-Glycerol Rhizotomy
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent facial pain and corneal anaesthesia.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with multiple comorbidities underwent percutaneous glycerol rhizotomy two years ago. He presented with recurrent V2 pain and a new corneal ulcer due to loss of the blink reflex (anaesthesia). Managed with topical lubricants for the eye and a trial of baclofen for the neuropathic pain.

trigeminal_neuralgia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Trigeminal Neuralgia secondary to CPA Tumour
  presenting_complaint: Progressive facial pain and ipsilateral hearing loss.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male presented with typical TN symptoms in the right V2/V3 distribution. Clinical examination revealed a diminished corneal reflex and mild sensorineural hearing loss on the right. MRI revealed a 2cm vestibular schwannoma in the cerebellopontine angle compressing the trigeminal nerve; referred for neurosurgical resection.

trigeminal_neuralgia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Trigeminal Neuralgia with Carbamazepine-induced Hyponatraemia
  presenting_complaint: Facial pain control but new-onset confusion and lethargy.
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old female was started on high-dose carbamazepine for severe TN. While pain was well-controlled, she developed symptomatic hyponatraemia (sodium 121 mmol/L) due to SIADH. Carbamazepine was tapered, and she was transitioned to gabapentin with fluid restriction, resolving the electrolyte imbalance.

trigeminal_neuralgia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Trigeminal Neuralgia
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent sharp facial pain in a 14-year-old.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old girl presented with paroxysmal pain triggered by smiling, initially misdiagnosed as dental abscess. MRI revealed a primitive trigeminal artery making contact with the nerve. Due to her age and severity, she underwent successful microvascular decompression (MVD) with complete resolution of symptoms.

trigeminal_neuralgia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Trigeminal Neuralgia (Post-MVD)
  presenting_complaint: Return of lancinating pain 3 years after surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male had previously undergone MVD with a 3-year pain-free interval. Symptoms returned suddenly in the same distribution (V3). Repeat imaging showed no new compression; he was managed with Gamma Knife radiosurgery as he was reluctant to undergo repeat open surgery.

trigeminal_neuralgia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Trigeminal Neuralgia (V2) mimicking Dental Pain
  presenting_complaint: Severe right-sided upper jaw pain.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female underwent two unnecessary root canal treatments and an extraction before a diagnosis of TN was considered. The pain was triggered by light touch to the nasolabial fold, not by temperature or percussion of teeth. Diagnosis confirmed by rapid response to a trial of oxcarbazepine.

trigeminal_neuralgia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Trigeminal Neuralgia in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: New-onset facial shocks during the second trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant woman developed V2 TN. Standard anticonvulsants were avoided where possible due to teratogenic risks; she was managed with low-dose gabapentin and local anaesthetic blocks (nerve blocks) to the infraorbital nerve, which provided temporary relief until delivery.

trigeminal_neuralgia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Trigeminal Neuralgia with Anaesthesia Dolorosa
  presenting_complaint: Constant, agonizing burning in a numb area of the face.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female developed anaesthesia dolorosa following a radiofrequency thermocoagulation procedure. She experienced a paradoxical combination of dense sensory loss and severe, intractable burning pain. Managed by the chronic pain team with a spinal cord stimulator (gasserian ganglion stimulation) with partial success.

trigeminal_neuralgia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Bilateral Trigeminal Neuralgia (Non-MS)
  presenting_complaint: Alternating electric shocks on both sides of the face.
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old male presented with bilateral TN symptoms; MRI was negative for MS plaques but showed bilateral ectatic basilar arteries. Due to his frailty and bilateral involvement, he was managed medically with a combination of pregabalin and carbamazepine, requiring close monitoring for sedation.

trigeminal_neuralgia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-Traumatic Trigeminal Neuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Sharp pain following maxillofacial trauma.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male developed TN-like symptoms following a complex mandibular fracture and subsequent ORIF. The pain was localised to the distribution of the inferior alveolar nerve. He was diagnosed with post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathy and showed moderate response to nortriptyline and lidocaine 5% medicated plasters.

trigeminal_neuralgia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Trigeminal Neuralgia (Mild/Early Stage)
  presenting_complaint: Occasional "zaps" in the right cheek when washing face.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male presented with infrequent, mild paroxysms of pain. Symptoms did not yet interfere with nutrition or sleep. A "watch and wait" approach was adopted initially, with the patient keeping a pain diary, before starting low-dose carbamazepine as frequency increased.

trigeminal_neuralgia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Trigeminal Neuralgia with Cluster-Tic Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: TN-like shocks associated with eye watering and redness.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male presented with features of both TN and cluster headache, including autonomic symptoms (lacrimation, rhinorrhoea). This rare "cluster-tic syndrome" required a dual treatment approach with carbamazepine for the TN component and subcutaneous sumatriptan for the cluster-like attacks.

trigeminal_neuralgia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Trigeminal Neuralgia (V3) triggered by Mastication
  presenting_complaint: Severe pain only when chewing, leading to 5kg weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old female was referred for suspected malignancy due to rapid weight loss. Investigation revealed the weight loss was secondary to fear of eating (sitophobia) due to V3 TN triggers. Pain was controlled with oxcarbazepine, allowing her to resume a normal diet and regain weight.

trigeminal_neuralgia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Trigeminal Neuralgia (Isolated V2)
  presenting_complaint: Stabbing pain in the right upper lip and wing of the nose.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female presented with isolated V2 symptoms. MRI showed a small venous loop contacting the nerve at the prepontine cistern. She opted for medical management and achieved 90% pain reduction on a combination of carbamazepine and baclofen.

trigeminal_neuralgia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Trigeminal Neuralgia in Parkinson’s Disease
  presenting_complaint: Facial pain complicating motor fluctuations.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with advanced Parkinson's disease developed left-sided TN. The management was complicated by the potential for drug interactions and increased fall risk with anticonvulsants. He eventually underwent successful Gamma Knife radiosurgery to avoid the systemic side effects of high-dose medications.
