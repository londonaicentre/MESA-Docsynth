  presenting_complaint: Widespread itchy redness followed by the appearance of large, tense blisters.
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old male was admitted with a subacute onset of severe pruritus and bullous lesions on his trunk and limbs. Direct immunofluorescence of a skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid. He responded well to high-dose oral prednisolone and topical clobetasol propionate, with a slow taper over several months.

  presenting_complaint: Daily occurrence of itchy wheals that last for several hours before disappearing.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old male had suffered from migratory, itchy hives for over four months with no identifiable trigger. Extensive allergy testing was negative, leading to a diagnosis of chronic spontaneous urticaria. His symptoms were eventually controlled using a four-fold dose of second-generation antihistamines (fexofenadine 180mg four times daily).
