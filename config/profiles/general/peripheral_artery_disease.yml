peripheral_artery_disease_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic foot with peripheral artery disease
  presenting_complaint: Infected ulcer on the first metatarsal head
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old female with long-standing T2DM and peripheral neuropathy presented with a malodorous, discharging foot ulcer. Despite palpable proximal pulses, Duplex showed severe infra-popliteal disease with monophasic flow in the dorsalis pedis. She required a combination of intravenous antibiotics, debridement, and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of the tibial arteries to facilitate wound healing.

peripheral_artery_disease_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic limb ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of long-standing calf pain following a period of dehydration
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with known claudication (stable for 3 years) presented with a 12-hour history of severe rest pain and coldness in the left foot. Imaging showed an acute thrombus overlying a pre-existing atherosclerotic plaque in the superficial femoral artery. He was treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis (tPA) followed by stenting of the underlying lesion.

peripheral_artery_disease_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Subclavian steal syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Dizziness and syncope when using the left arm
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female presented with neurological symptoms triggered by vigorous left arm exercise, alongside a 30mmHg blood pressure discrepancy between arms. Duplex ultrasonography demonstrated retrograde flow in the left vertebral artery during arm exertion. She underwent successful endovascular stenting of the proximal left subclavian artery.

peripheral_artery_disease_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES)
  presenting_complaint: Exercise-induced calf pain in a young athlete
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male rugby player with no cardiovascular risk factors presented with progressive claudication. MRI of the knee revealed an anomalous medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle compressing the popliteal artery. He underwent surgical decompression and myotomy, resulting in full resolution of symptoms and return to sport.

peripheral_artery_disease_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-angioplasty restenosis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrence of leg pain 4 months after endovascular treatment
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male who previously underwent balloon angioplasty for a right iliac stenosis returned with a 2-week history of recurrent claudication. Repeat angiography confirmed significant neointimal hyperplasia at the site of the previous intervention. He was treated with a drug-eluting stent (DES) to maintain vessel patency.

peripheral_artery_disease_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic peripheral artery disease
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of low ABPI during a routine cardiovascular check
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female with hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia was found to have an ABPI of 0.82 bilaterally during a health screen, despite no symptoms of claudication. She was diagnosed with asymptomatic PAD and started on secondary prevention (statin and aspirin) to reduce her high risk of future myocardial infarction and stroke.

peripheral_artery_disease_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Blue toe syndrome (Atheroembolism)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, painful purple discolouration of the second and third toes
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male presented with "trash foot" symptoms despite having palpable pedal pulses. Trans-oesophageal echocardiography and CT imaging identified a shaggy, ulcerated plaque in the abdominal aorta as the source of micro-emboli. He was managed conservatively with high-dose statins and antiplatelet therapy to stabilise the proximal plaque.

peripheral_artery_disease_013:
  primary_diagnosis: PAD with Mönckeberg's arteriosclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Foot pain in a patient with end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old female on haemodialysis presented with ischaemic-appearing toes, but her ABPI was falsely elevated (>1.4) due to non-compressible calcified vessels. Toe-Brachial Index (TBI) was measured at 0.25, confirming severe distal ischaemia. Due to extensive medial calcification, she was a poor candidate for angioplasty and was managed with conservative wound care and pain optimisation.

peripheral_artery_disease_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Thrombosed popliteal artery aneurysm
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of calf pain and a pulsatile mass behind the knee
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old male presented with acute ischaemia of the lower leg.

  presenting_complaint: Fever and purulent discharge from a groin incision
  summary_of_course: A 71-year-old male, 3 weeks post-bypass surgery, presented with systemic sepsis and a breakdown of the surgical wound. Imaging showed a perigraft fluid collection and loss of graft patency. He required emergency graft excision, debridement of infected tissue, and extra-anatomic obturator bypass to salvage the limb.

peripheral_artery_disease_017:
  primary_diagnosis: External iliac artery endofibrosis
  presenting_complaint: Thigh pain only occurring at maximal cycling intensity
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old competitive cyclist presented with "power loss" in the left leg during sprints. Conventional ABPI was normal at rest but dropped significantly to 0.5 after a maximal exercise provocation test. Angiography showed a focal thickening of the intima in the external iliac artery, which was treated with surgical patch angioplasty.

peripheral_artery_diagnosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Wet gangrene secondary to PAD
  presenting_complaint: Foul-smelling, black discolouration of the forefoot with systemic upset
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male with neglected PAD presented with delirium, hypotension, and extensive liquefactive necrosis of the right foot. He was diagnosed with wet gangrene and ascending cellulitis. Following stabilisation with fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics, he underwent a life-saving urgent below-knee amputation (BKA).

peripheral_artery_disease_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Cystic adventitial disease
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive calf claudication over two weeks
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female presented with a sudden reduction in walking distance. Duplex ultrasound showed an "hourglass" narrowing of the popliteal artery, and MRI revealed mucoid cysts within the vessel wall. She underwent surgical excision of the cysts and the affected arterial segment with a vein patch repair, restoring normal flow.

peripheral_artery_disease_020:
  primary_diagnosis: End-stage PAD with frailty
  presenting_complaint: Severe rest pain in a patient with advanced dementia
  summary_of_course: A 92-year-old male resident of a nursing home presented with ischaemic rest pain and a necrotic hallux. Given his significant comorbidities, frailty, and poor functional status, he was deemed unsuitable for revascularisation or major amputation. He was managed with a palliative approach, focusing on intensive analgesia and end-of-life care.
