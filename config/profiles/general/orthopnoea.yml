  presenting_complaint: Fever, night sweats, and new-onset orthopnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use presented with a two-week history of malaise and sudden orthopnoea. Echocardiography showed large vegetations on the aortic valve with severe acute regurgitation. He required emergency valve replacement and a six-week course of intravenous antibiotics for Staphylococcus aureus.

orthopnoea_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Cardiac Amyloidosis
  presenting_complaint: Progressive exercise intolerance and mild orthopnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male presented with chronic, worsening breathlessness and a requirement for two pillows at night. Despite a normal ejection fraction on echocardiography, cardiac MRI and a bone scintigraphy (DPD) scan confirmed ATTR amyloidosis. He was commenced on tafamidis and cautious diuretic therapy to manage his restrictive cardiomyopathy.

orthopnoea_012:
  primary_diagnosis: High-Output Heart Failure due to Severe Anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations, lethargy, and orthopnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with severe menorrhagia presented with a haemoglobin of 4.2 g/dL. The resulting high-output state led to pulmonary venous congestion and orthopnoea. Symptoms resolved rapidly following a slow blood transfusion and subsequent iron supplementation, with no evidence of primary cardiac disease.

orthopnoea_013:
  primary_diagnosis: COPD and Heart Failure Overlap
  presenting_complaint: Wheezing and nocturnal breathlessness.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old heavy smoker presented with chronic breathlessness, initially attributed solely to COPD. However, the presence of orthopnoea prompted further investigation, revealing a co-existing dilated cardiomyopathy. A combined regimen of long-acting bronchodilators and heart failure medications (ARNI and SGLT2 inhibitors) significantly improved his functional capacity.
