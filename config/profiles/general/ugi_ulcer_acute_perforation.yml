  presenting_complaint: Weight loss, early satiety, and sudden-onset acute pain.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male with a 3-month history of dyspepsia presented with acute peritonitis. Intra-operative findings revealed a perforated ulcer with suspicious heaped-up margins in the antrum. Biopsies confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma, and the patient was subsequently referred for oncological staging and palliative management.

ugi_ulcer_acute_perforation_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent perforated duodenal ulcer
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent severe epigastric pain post-previous repair.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male who had a Graham patch 2 years prior presented with similar acute symptoms after failing to complete H. pylori eradication.

  primary_diagnosis: PPI-masked perforated gastric ulcer
  presenting_complaint: Vague dyspepsia for weeks followed by sudden syncope.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female on high-dose Omeprazole presented after a syncopal episode; she had no classic signs of peritonitis. CT showed a large amount of free air from a perforated gastric body ulcer. The lack of inflammatory response was attributed to the high-dose PPI therapy masking the early symptoms.

ugi_ulcer_acute_perforation_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Failed conservative management of perforated duodenal ulcer
  presenting_complaint: Increasing abdominal pain and rising inflammatory markers.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with multiple comorbidities was initially managed conservatively for a small, stable duodenal leak. After 48 hours, his CRP rose to 350 and he developed SIRS.
