von_willebrand_disease_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 1 Von Willebrand Disease
  presenting_complaint: Heavy menstrual bleeding and iron deficiency anaemia
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old girl presented with menarche-associated menorrhagia requiring oral iron supplementation. Investigations revealed VWF:Ag 32 IU/dL and VWF:RCo 30 IU/dL, confirming mild Type 1 vWD. She was successfully managed with tranexamic acid and a trial of desmopressin (DDAVP) which showed a good increment in VWF levels.

  primary_diagnosis: Type 2A Von Willebrand Disease
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent epistaxis and easy bruising
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy with a history of frequent, prolonged nosebleeds since early childhood. Laboratory tests showed a significant discrepancy between VWF:Ag (45 IU/dL) and VWF:RCo (12 IU/dL), with loss of high-molecular-weight multimers on gel electrophoresis. He is currently managed with prophylactic tranexamic acid and VWF/FVIII concentrate for major procedures.

  primary_diagnosis: Type 3 Von Willebrand Disease
  presenting_complaint: Spontaneous haemarthrosis of the right knee
  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old male with severe, undetectable VWF levels (VWF:Ag <1 IU/dL) and very low Factor VIII (3 IU/dL). He presented with acute joint swelling after minor trauma, requiring immediate infusion of high-purity VWF concentrate. Due to the severity and recurrent joint bleeds, he has been commenced on a long-term prophylaxis regimen.

von_willebrand_disease_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Acquired Von Willebrand Syndrome (Heyde's Syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding and exertional dyspnoea
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male with known severe aortic stenosis presented with melaena. Endoscopy identified bleeding angiodysplasia in the caecum, and coagulation studies showed a loss of large VWF multimers due to high shear stress. Symptoms resolved following a successful transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), which corrected the underlying proteolytic degradation of VWF.

von_willebrand_disease_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 2B Von Willebrand Disease
  presenting_complaint: Thrombocytopenia and post-operative bleeding
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old woman experienced prolonged bleeding following an appendicectomy. Blood films showed mild thrombocytopenia (110 x 10^9/L) and increased platelet agglutination with low-dose ristocetin. Genetic testing confirmed a gain-of-function mutation in the VWF A1 domain; desmopressin was contraindicated due to the risk of worsening thrombocytopenia.

von_willebrand_disease_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 2N Von Willebrand Disease (Normandy)
  presenting_complaint: Excessive bleeding after dental extraction
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male was initially suspected of having mild Haemophilia A due to a low Factor VIII level (12 IU/dL) but a normal VWF:Ag. However, a VWF:FVIII binding assay revealed markedly reduced binding affinity, confirming Type 2N vWD. He requires FVIII-containing VWF concentrates for haemostatic cover during invasive procedures.

von_willebrand_disease_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 1 Von Willebrand Disease
  presenting_complaint: Prolonged bleeding following routine tonsillectomy
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old girl required a return to theatre for haemostasis 4 hours post-tonsillectomy. Post-operative workup showed VWF:Ag 38 IU/dL and VWF:RCo 35 IU/dL. She was treated with a single dose of VWF concentrate and discharged on a 7-day course of tranexamic acid with no further complications.

von_willebrand_disease_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 3 Von Willebrand Disease
  presenting_complaint: Life-threatening intracranial haemorrhage
  summary_of_course: A 2-year-old boy was admitted to the ICU following a fall from a high chair, with imaging showing a large subdural haematoma. Known to have Type 3 vWD, he was treated with emergency boluses of VWF/FVIII concentrate and underwent neurosurgical evacuation. He survived with minor neurological deficits and remains on secondary prophylaxis.

von_willebrand_disease_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 1 Von Willebrand Disease in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Management of delivery and postpartum haemorrhage risk
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old pregnant woman with Type 1 vWD (baseline VWF:Ag 30 IU/dL) was monitored throughout her third trimester. Her VWF levels naturally rose to 110 IU/dL by week 36, allowing for a safe vaginal delivery without prophylactic factor. However, she developed delayed postpartum haemorrhage on day 5 as VWF levels rapidly fell, requiring tranexamic acid and a short course of DDAVP.

von_willebrand_disease_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Acquired Von Willebrand Syndrome (MGUS-associated)
  presenting_complaint: Spontaneous ecchymosis and mucosal bleeding
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female with Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS) developed new-onset bleeding symptoms. Investigations showed VWF:Ag 20 IU/dL and VWF:RCo 15 IU/dL with no family history of bleeding. The diagnosis of AVWS was made, likely due to autoantibody-mediated clearance of VWF, and she responded partially to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy.

von_willebrand_disease_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 2M Von Willebrand Disease
  presenting_complaint: Chronic iron deficiency and heavy bruising
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male presented with persistent iron deficiency despite oral replacement. Coagulation profile showed a VWF:RCo/VWF:Ag ratio of 0.4, but multimer distribution was normal, characteristic of Type 2M. He was managed with tranexamic acid for minor bleeds and VWF concentrate for a subsequent elective inguinal hernia repair.

von_willebrand_disease_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 1 Von Willebrand Disease (Low VWF)
  presenting_complaint: Pre-operative assessment for cholecystectomy
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old woman with a history of mild bruising was found to have VWF:Ag of 42 IU/dL during pre-operative screening. As her levels were in the 30-50 IU/dL range (often termed 'low VWF'), a DDAVP challenge was performed, showing an excellent response. She underwent an uneventful laparoscopic cholecystectomy with a single pre-operative dose of desmopressin.

von_willebrand_disease_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 3 Von Willebrand Disease with Arthropathy
  presenting_complaint: Chronic bilateral ankle pain and restricted mobility
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with Type 3 vWD presented with advanced haemophilic-like arthropathy due to inadequate prophylaxis in childhood. MRI confirmed significant synovial thickening and cartilage loss in both ankles. He is currently managed with regular VWF concentrate prophylaxis and has been referred for orthopaedic review regarding possible joint fusion.

von_willebrand_disease_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 2A Von Willebrand Disease
  presenting_complaint: Severe gastrointestinal haemorrhage from angiodysplasia
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female with Type 2A vWD was admitted with haematochezia. Colonoscopy revealed multiple angiodysplastic lesions in the ascending colon. Despite several sessions of argon plasma coagulation, she required long-term treatment with tranexamic acid and occasional VWF concentrate to manage recurrent occult GI bleeding.

von_willebrand_disease_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 1 Von Willebrand Disease (Diagnostic Challenge)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent epistaxis and family history of bleeding
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old boy had borderline VWF levels (VWF:Ag 48 IU/dL) on initial testing during an acute respiratory infection. Repeat testing when well showed VWF:Ag 34 IU/dL and VWF:RCo 31 IU/dL, confirming the diagnosis. This case highlighted the role of VWF as an acute phase reactant, which can mask mild deficiency during illness or stress.

von_willebrand_disease_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 2B Von Willebrand Disease in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Worsening thrombocytopenia in the third trimester
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old pregnant woman with Type 2B vWD saw her platelet count drop from 120 x 10^9/L to 45 x 10^9/L as her VWF levels rose during pregnancy. This was due to increased mutant VWF-platelet binding. She was managed with platelet transfusions and VWF concentrate during a planned Caesarean section to maintain haemostasis.

von_willebrand_disease_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 1 Von Willebrand Disease (DDAVP Non-responder)
  presenting_complaint: Failed haemostasis after minor oral surgery
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male with Type 1 vWD (VWF:Ag 25 IU/dL) underwent a DDAVP challenge that failed to achieve VWF levels >50 IU/dL. Following a dental extraction, he experienced persistent oozing despite tranexamic acid. He was successfully treated with a single dose of VWF/FVIII concentrate, and his management plan was updated to avoid future desmopressin use.

von_willebrand_disease_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Acquired Von Willebrand Syndrome (Wilms Tumour)
  presenting_complaint: Haematuria and abdominal mass
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old girl was diagnosed with a Wilms tumour and concurrently found to have very low VWF levels (VWF:Ag 15 IU/dL) with no prior bleeding history. The AVWS was attributed to adsorption of VWF onto the malignant cells. Following surgical resection of the tumour and chemotherapy, her VWF levels spontaneously normalised.

von_willebrand_disease_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 1 Von Willebrand Disease
  presenting_complaint: Major GI bleed while on anticoagulation for Atrial Fibrillation
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with Type 1 vWD and AF was started on Apixaban, leading to a severe upper GI bleed. Coagulation studies showed VWF:Ag 38 IU/dL. The bleed was managed with endoscopic clipping, reversal of anticoagulation, and VWF concentrate; he was subsequently transitioned to a left atrial appendage occlusion device to avoid long-term anticoagulation.

von_willebrand_disease_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 2N Von Willebrand Disease
  presenting_complaint: Severe menorrhagia and low Factor VIII
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female presented with life-impacting periods and a Factor VIII level of 8 IU/dL. Initial suspicion of carrier status for Haemophilia A was ruled out by genetic testing, which instead identified homozygous mutations in the VWF D' domain. She is now managed with a combination of continuous oral contraceptive pills and VWF/FVIII concentrate for breakthrough bleeding.
