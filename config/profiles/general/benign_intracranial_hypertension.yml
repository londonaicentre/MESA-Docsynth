MR venography revealed high-grade bilateral transverse sinus stenosis. She underwent retrograde pressure wire manometry which confirmed a significant pressure gradient, leading to successful transverse sinus stenting and subsequent resolution of her papilloedema.

benign_intracranial_hypertension_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Worsening headache and photophobia in second trimester
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old female, 20 weeks pregnant, presented with typical IIH symptoms and confirmed papilloedema. Management was complicated by pregnancy, necessitating close multidisciplinary care between neurology and obstetrics. She was managed conservatively with serial visual field monitoring and limited use of acetazolamide after the first trimester, eventually delivering a healthy infant via spontaneous vaginal delivery.

benign_intracranial_hypertension_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Benign Intracranial Hypertension (Asymptomatic)
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of bilateral papilloedema at routine optician appointment
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old asymptomatic female was referred by her community optometrist after routine fundus photography showed blurred disc margins. Despite the lack of headaches or visual obscurations, her opening pressure was 33 cmH2O on lumbar puncture. She was diagnosed with asymptomatic IIH and managed with lifestyle modifications and three-monthly ophthalmology reviews to ensure no occult visual field loss.

benign_intracranial_hypertension_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Return of headaches following significant weight gain
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female who had been in remission from IIH for five years presented with a relapse of symptoms after a 15kg weight gain over 12 months. Repeat lumbar puncture confirmed a return of elevated intracranial pressure (34 cmH2O). She was recommenced on acetazolamide and enrolled in a structured weight management programme, emphasizing the link between adiposity and disease activity.

benign_intracranial_hypertension_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (Atypical BMI)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic daily headache and visual "grey-outs"
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old female with a BMI of 21 presented with classic symptoms of raised intracranial pressure. Despite her low BMI, fundoscopy confirmed Grade 3 papilloedema and LP showed an opening pressure of 35 cmH2O. This case of "lean" IIH required extensive workup to exclude secondary causes, but none were found, necessitating standard IIH management.

benign_intracranial_hypertension_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension with Shunt Malfunction
  presenting_complaint: Acute recurrence of severe headache and vomiting
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female with a known history of IIH and a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt presented to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of raised ICP. A shunt series and CT head were inconclusive, but a formal shunt tap and manometry confirmed high proximal pressure. She underwent emergency shunt revision for a distal catheter blockage with immediate symptomatic relief.

  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension with Sleep Apnoea
  presenting_complaint: Morning headaches and daytime somnolence
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with a BMI of 42 presented with severe morning headaches and papilloedema. Sleep studies confirmed severe Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA), and LP showed an opening pressure of 36 cmH2O. Treatment with CPAP therapy and weight loss led to a significant reduction in intracranial pressure and resolution of his visual symptoms.

benign_intracranial_hypertension_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension in an elderly patient
  presenting_complaint: New onset headache and visual field defects
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female presented with symptoms mimicking giant cell arteritis, but with a normal ESR and CRP. Fundoscopy revealed bilateral papilloedema, and MRI ruled out intracranial masses. A lumbar puncture confirmed an opening pressure of 29 cmH2O, making this a rare case of late-onset IIH, which was managed successfully with low-dose furosemide.

benign_intracranial_hypertension_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension with CSF Rhinorrhea
  presenting_complaint: Clear fluid leaking from the nose and chronic headache
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old female with a history of untreated chronic headaches presented with a spontaneous clear nasal discharge. Beta-2 transferrin testing confirmed the fluid was CSF, and imaging showed a skull base defect in the cribriform plate. The underlying cause was identified as long-standing undiagnosed IIH (opening pressure 38 cmH2O), requiring both a surgical repair of the leak and a VP shunt to manage the pressure.

benign_intracranial_hypertension_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension with psychiatric comorbidity
  presenting_complaint: Headache and depression
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female with IIH and clinical depression presented with worsening symptoms. There was concern that her antidepressant medications might be contributing to weight gain, further exacerbating her IIH. Her treatment was tailored to include topiramate, which assisted with both headache management and weight neutrality, alongside cognitive behavioural therapy.

benign_intracranial_hypertension_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (Acute-on-Chronic)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of vision and severe nausea
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female with known mild IIH presented with an acute exacerbation following a short course of oral steroids for asthma. Her vision dropped from 6/6 to 6/12 bilaterally within 48 hours. She required an urgent therapeutic lumbar puncture to bridge her until increased doses of acetazolamide took effect, highlighting the risk of steroid-induced pressure spikes.
