  presenting_complaint: Chronic blue tinge to the skin and significant finger clubbing.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female with an unrepaired large ventricular septal defect presented with exertional dyspnoea and chronic central cyanosis. Investigations showed pulmonary hypertension with reversal of the shunt (right-to-left). She was managed by the specialist adult congenital heart disease team with bosentan and long-term oxygen therapy.

cyanosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Limb Ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of a cold, painful, and blue right foot.
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old male with atrial fibrillation presented with a "mottled and cyanosed" right lower limb. On examination, the foot was pulseless, pale, and cold to the touch (the 6 Ps). He underwent an emergency femoral embolectomy to restore perfusion and prevent tissue necrosis.
