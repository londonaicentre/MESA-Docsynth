iron_deficiency_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Nutritional iron deficiency anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Lethargy and pallor in a toddler
  summary_of_course: A 2-year-old male presented with a 3-month history of increasing tiredness and poor appetite. Dietetic history revealed excessive cow's milk intake (>1 litre/day) and limited solids. Investigations showed Hb 82 g/L, MCV 64 fL, and ferritin 5 µg/L. He was treated with oral ferrous sulphate syrup and milk restriction, with Hb rising to 110 g/L after 4 weeks.

iron_deficiency_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Iron deficiency secondary to menorrhagia
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath on exertion and heavy menstrual bleeding
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female reported flooding and clots during periods for 12 months. Blood tests confirmed moderate microcytic anaemia (Hb 91 g/L, ferritin 9 µg/L). Pelvic ultrasound identified intramural fibroids. She was commenced on tranexamic acid for bleeding control and oral ferrous fumarate 210mg BD, showing significant symptomatic improvement by the 2-month follow-up.

iron_deficiency_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Iron deficiency anaemia secondary to occult GI malignancy
  presenting_complaint: Unintentional weight loss and altered bowel habit
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male presented with a 6-month history of fatigue and loose stools. Investigations revealed severe iron deficiency anaemia (Hb 68 g/L, ferritin 4 µg/L). Urgent colonoscopy identified a friable mass in the caecum, confirmed as adenocarcinoma on biopsy. He received a preoperative IV iron infusion (ferric carboxymaltose) followed by a right hemicolectomy.

iron_deficiency_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-gastric bypass malabsorptive iron deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Refractory fatigue and brittle nails
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female, five years post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, presented with chronic exhaustion despite oral iron supplements. Bloods showed Hb 105 g/L and ferritin 7 µg/L. Due to bypassed duodenum and proximal jejunum, oral absorption was deemed inadequate. She was managed with scheduled six-monthly IV iron infusions, maintaining Hb within the reference range.

iron_deficiency_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Iron deficiency of pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Routine third-trimester screening showing low haemoglobin
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old G2P1 at 32 weeks gestation was found to have Hb 102 g/L and ferritin 12 µg/L. She complained of mild dizziness but was otherwise asymptomatic. In line with NICE guidelines, she was started on oral ferrous fumarate 210mg daily. Repeat testing at 36 weeks showed Hb improved to 118 g/L prior to delivery.

iron_deficiency_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Non-anaemic iron deficiency in an elite athlete
  presenting_complaint: Decreased athletic performance and pica (craving ice)
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old vegan marathon runner reported a plateau in training times and persistent Pagophagia. Haemoglobin was normal at 138 g/L, but ferritin was critically low at 8 µg/L with a TSAT of 12%. She was diagnosed with iron depletion without anaemia, likely due to increased demand and foot-strike haemolysis. Dietary counselling and low-dose oral iron supplementation resolved the pica and improved her VO2 max.

iron_deficiency_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Iron deficiency secondary to Coeliac disease
  presenting_complaint: Chronic bloating and refractory anaemia
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old female presented with persistent microcytic anaemia (Hb 108 g/L) that failed to respond to six months of oral iron. Serology for anti-TTG was strongly positive, and duodenal biopsy confirmed Marsh 3c changes. Following the initiation of a strict gluten-free diet, her intestinal absorption improved, and her iron stores normalised within nine months without further supplementation.

iron_deficiency_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Functional iron deficiency in Chronic Kidney Disease
  presenting_complaint: Progressive fatigue in a dialysis patient
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with Stage 5 CKD on haemodialysis presented with worsening anaemia (Hb 88 g/L). Ferritin was 250 µg/L (elevated as an acute phase reactant), but TSAT was low at 15%, indicating functional iron deficiency. He was treated with IV iron sucrose 100mg during dialysis sessions and Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents (ESA), successfully targeting an Hb of 105-115 g/L.

iron_deficiency_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic iron deficiency anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Haematemesis and collapse
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with a history of chronic NSAID use for osteoarthritis presented to A&E with coffee-ground vomit and tachycardia. Initial Hb was 72 g/L on a background of known mild anaemia (Hb 110 g/L). Gastroscopy revealed a bleeding peptic ulcer (Forrest IIb). He received two units of packed red cells, IV proton pump inhibitors, and follow-up IV iron to replenish depleted stores.

iron_deficiency_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Iron deficiency anaemia in a premature infant
  presenting_complaint: Pallor and poor weight gain at 9-month review
  summary_of_course: A male infant born at 30 weeks gestation presented with significant pallor. Having missed routine neonatal iron supplementation, his Hb was 85 g/L with low iron indices. He was commenced on oral iron drops (Sytron) and weaning advice was provided to include iron-rich solids. Follow-up at 12 months showed normalisation of Hb and improved growth velocity.

iron_deficiency_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Iron deficiency in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)
  presenting_complaint: Exacerbation of Crohn's disease and profound weakness
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male with ileocolonic Crohn's presented with a flare (CRP 85 mg/L). Hb was 89 g/L; ferritin was 48 µg/L, which was misleadingly "normal" due to inflammation. TSAT was 8%, confirming absolute iron deficiency. Due to the risk of oral iron exacerbating GI symptoms, he received 1000mg of IV ferric carboxymaltose, resulting in an Hb rise to 122 g/L over six weeks.

iron_deficiency_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Iron deficiency in Heart Failure (HFrEF)
  presenting_complaint: Reduced exercise tolerance (NYHA Class III)
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with ischaemic cardiomyopathy was found to have iron deficiency (ferritin 75 µg/L, TSAT 16%) despite a normal Hb of 128 g/L. In accordance with ESC guidelines, she was treated with IV iron (ferric carboxymaltose) to improve functional capacity. Post-infusion, her 6-minute walk test distance increased significantly, and her NYHA class improved to II.

iron_deficiency_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Iron deficiency associated with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)
  presenting_complaint: Disturbed sleep and distressing leg sensations at night
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female complained of an irresistible urge to move her legs in the evenings. Hb was normal at 135 g/L, but ferritin was 22 µg/L. Clinical guidelines suggest targeting a ferritin >75 µg/L for RLS management. She was started on oral ferrous sulphate 200mg BD with Vitamin C; her RLS symptoms resolved as her ferritin levels reached 85 µg/L.

iron_deficiency_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic iron deficiency from frequent blood donation
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic low ferritin on routine screening
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male, who had donated blood 20 times in 5 years, was found to have a ferritin of 10 µg/L during a health check. Hb was 132 g/L. He was advised to suspend blood donations for six months and completed a three-month course of oral iron. Subsequent testing showed ferritin had recovered to 45 µg/L, and he was counselled on increasing dietary iron intake.

iron_deficiency_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-operative iron deficiency anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Post-operative dizziness following total hip replacement
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old female underwent an elective THR with an estimated blood loss of 600ml. Post-operative Hb dropped from 125 g/L to 79 g/L. She was symptomatic with postural hypotension. Rather than transfusion, she was treated with a single dose of IV iron (Monofer) and oral supplements on discharge. Her Hb recovered to 112 g/L by her 6-week surgical review.

iron_deficiency_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Parasitic-induced iron deficiency anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Severe lethargy and abdominal pain after overseas travel
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male returned from a 6-month backpacking trip in Southeast Asia with profound fatigue. Bloods showed Hb 54 g/L and eosinophilia. Stool microscopy confirmed Necator americanus (hookworm) infection. He was treated with albendazole and received two units of red cell transfusion followed by oral iron, with full recovery of haematological parameters.

iron_deficiency_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic iron deficiency in Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent, severe epistaxis and chronic anaemia
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with HHT suffered from daily nosebleeds requiring nasal packing. He had chronic iron deficiency anaemia (baseline Hb 85-95 g/L) due to persistent blood loss. He was maintained on a programme of monthly IV iron infusions in the day unit, which successfully avoided the need for regular blood transfusions and maintained his Hb at approximately 105 g/L.

iron_deficiency_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia (IRIDA)
  presenting_complaint: Lifelong anaemia unresponsive to oral iron
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old girl presented with persistent microcytic anaemia (Hb 88 g/L). Despite multiple courses of oral iron, her ferritin remained low-normal and TSAT was very low (5%). Genetic testing confirmed a mutation in the TMPRSS6 gene. She was diagnosed with IRIDA, a rare condition where high hepcidin levels block iron absorption, and she now requires regular parenteral iron.

iron_deficiency_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Iron deficiency secondary to NSAID-induced gastropathy
  presenting_complaint: Epigastric pain and melaena
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female taking high-dose ibuprofen for knee osteoarthritis presented with dark, tarry stools. Hb was 62 g/L, MCV 70 fL. Endoscopy revealed multiple gastric erosions and a small prepyloric ulcer. She was treated with PPIs, NSAIDs were discontinued, and she received an IV iron infusion. Her Hb increased to 115 g/L over the following month.

iron_deficiency_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild iron deficiency in an adolescent
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue and poor concentration during school exams
  summary_of_course: A 17-year-old female competitive swimmer presented with "brain fog" and tiredness. Hb was 114 g/L and ferritin was 14 µg/L. A combination of heavy menstrual cycles, intense training, and a self-imposed restrictive diet was identified as the cause. Following dietary modification and a short course of ferrous gluconate, her symptoms resolved and Hb normalised to 128 g/L.
