chronic_ischaemic_heart_disease_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Stable Angina Pectoris
  presenting_complaint: Exertional chest heaviness and shortness of breath.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented to the GP with a 3-month history of retrosternal pressure radiating to the left arm during brisk walking. Clinical examination was unremarkable, but an exercise tolerance test (ETT) demonstrated 2mm ST-segment depression in leads V4-V6. He was diagnosed with stable angina and commenced on aspirin, atorvastatin, and a PRN GTN spray, resulting in good symptomatic control.

chronic_ischaemic_heart_disease_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Ischaemic Cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Progressive orthopnoea and peripheral oedema.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female with a history of two previous myocardial infarctions presented with signs of congestive heart failure. Echocardiography revealed a dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 30% and global hypokinesia. She was stabilised with furosemide and initiated on quadruple therapy for heart failure secondary to chronic ischaemic heart disease.

chronic_ischaemic_heart_disease_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Microvascular Angina (Cardiac Syndrome X)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent chest pain at rest and during stress.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old perimenopausal female presented with typical anginal symptoms but had a normal invasive coronary angiogram. Subsequent cardiac MRI with perfusion mapping identified subendocardial ischaemia consistent with microvascular dysfunction. She was managed with diltiazem and lifestyle modifications with partial resolution of symptoms.

chronic_ischaemic_heart_disease_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Angina
  presenting_complaint: Persistent chest pain despite maximal medical therapy.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male with triple-vessel disease, unsuitable for further revascularisation (CABG or PCI), continued to experience Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Class IV angina. Despite being on bisoprolol, isosorbide mononitrate, nicorandil, and ranolazine, his quality of life remained poor. He was referred to the pain clinic for consideration of a spinal cord stimulator.

chronic_ischaemic_heart_disease_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Silent Myocardial Ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic; incidental finding on routine ECG.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with long-standing Type 2 diabetes underwent a routine preoperative ECG which showed deep Q waves in the inferior leads. A subsequent stress echocardiogram demonstrated a significant area of inducible hypokinesia in the RCA territory. He was started on secondary prevention for chronic ischaemic heart disease despite never experiencing overt chest pain.

chronic_ischaemic_heart_disease_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Total Occlusion (CTO) of the Right Coronary Artery
  presenting_complaint: Dull ache in the chest and reduced exercise tolerance.
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male smoker was found to have a chronic total occlusion of the RCA on angiography during investigation for stable angina. Viability studies (cardiac MRI) confirmed hibernating myocardium in the inferior wall. He underwent a complex PCI to the CTO with successful recanalisation and improvement in his exertional symptoms.

chronic_ischaemic_heart_disease_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Prinzmetal (Variant) Angina
  presenting_complaint: Severe chest pain occurring at rest, typically in the early morning.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female smoker presented with episodes of nocturnal chest pain associated with transient ST-segment elevation on ambulatory monitoring. Coronary angiography showed no fixed obstructive lesions, but provocative testing with acetylcholine induced coronary vasospasm. She was successfully treated with high-dose calcium channel blockers and smoking cessation advice.

chronic_ischaemic_heart_disease_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Ischaemic Heart Disease with Atrial Fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations and worsening exertional breathlessness.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with known ischaemic heart disease presented with new-onset atrial fibrillation and a rapid ventricular response. Rate control was achieved with digoxin and beta-blockers, and he was started on edoxaban for stroke prevention. His management was complicated by the need to balance anticoagulation with his existing antiplatelet regimen for previous coronary stents.

chronic_ischaemic_heart_disease_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-CABG Recurrent Angina
  presenting_complaint: Return of chest pain ten years after bypass surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male, who underwent triple CABG in 2013, presented with recurrent CCS Class II angina. Angiography revealed a patent LIMA graft to the LAD but occlusion of the saphenous vein grafts to the circumflex and RCA. He was managed medically with the addition of ivabradine as he was not a candidate for redo surgery.

chronic_ischaemic_heart_disease_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Ischaemic Heart Disease with Severe Mitral Regurgitation
  presenting_complaint: Acute-on-chronic breathlessness and orthopnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with a history of inferior MI presented with pulmonary oedema. Investigations showed functional mitral regurgitation due to tethering of the leaflets from ventricular remodelling. After stabilising his heart failure, he was scheduled for a percutaneous mitral valve repair (MitraClip) alongside optimized medical therapy for his underlying ischaemia.

chronic_ischaemic_heart_disease_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Left Main Stem Disease
  presenting_complaint: Presyncope and severe chest tightness on minimal exertion.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old female with multiple risk factors underwent CT coronary angiography (CTCA) which revealed 80% stenosis of the distal left main stem. Due to the high-risk nature of the lesion and her SYNTAX score, she was referred for urgent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She recovered well postoperatively with complete resolution of her symptoms.

chronic_ischaemic_heart_disease_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Ischaemic Heart Disease exacerbated by Anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Worsening angina associated with lethargy.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female with known stable CAD presented with increased frequency of GTN use. Blood tests revealed a microcytic anaemia (Hb 82 g/L) secondary to menorrhagia. Following a blood transfusion and iron supplementation, her anginal threshold significantly improved, demonstrating the impact of oxygen-carrying capacity on chronic ischaemia.

chronic_ischaemic_heart_disease_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Ischaemic Heart Disease in Frail Elderly
  presenting_complaint: Generalised weakness and occasional chest discomfort.
  summary_of_course: An 89-year-old female living in a residential home was diagnosed with ischaemic heart disease based on clinical history and ECG changes. Given her frailty and comorbidities, a conservative management plan was adopted. She was treated with low-dose bisoprolol and GTN spray for symptom relief, focusing on quality of life rather than invasive investigation.

chronic_ischaemic_heart_disease_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Ischaemic Heart Disease with Ventricular Arrhythmia
  presenting_complaint: Sudden collapse and palpitations.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with a previous anterior MI and chronic ischaemia presented following a syncopal episode. Telemetry captured non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). He underwent an ICD (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator) insertion for secondary prevention and had his beta-blocker dose uptitrated to suppress further arrhythmic events.

chronic_ischaemic_heart_disease_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Angina Equivalent (Dyspnoea)
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath on exertion without chest pain.
  summary_of_course: A 57-year-old male with Type 2 diabetes presented with breathlessness when climbing stairs. A myocardial perfusion scan showed reversible ischaemia in the LAD territory, confirming that his dyspnoea was an "anginal equivalent." He was treated with PCI to a 90% LAD lesion, which completely resolved his exertional breathlessness.

chronic_ischaemic_heart_disease_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Multi-vessel Disease with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
  presenting_complaint: Stable angina and Stage 4 CKD.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male with an eGFR of 25 ml/min presented with limiting angina. Management was challenging due to the high risk of contrast-induced nephropathy during angiography. A multidisciplinary team decided on a pressure wire-guided PCI using minimal contrast, successfully treating his symptoms while preserving renal function.

chronic_ischaemic_heart_disease_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Ischaemic Heart Disease with Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent claudication and exertional chest pain.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old heavy smoker presented with both calf pain and chest pain on walking. Investigations confirmed severe multi-level PAD and significant CAD. He was started on high-intensity statin therapy, clopidogrel, and referred for a supervised exercise programme, with a view to staged revascularisation of both territories.

chronic_ischaemic_heart_disease_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Ischaemic Heart Disease with Rheumatic Heart Disease
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue and exertional angina.
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old female with a history of childhood rheumatic fever presented with mixed valvular disease and angina. Angiography showed moderate CAD alongside mitral stenosis. She underwent a combined procedure involving a mitral valve replacement and single-vessel CABG, resulting in significant functional improvement.

chronic_ischaemic_heart_disease_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Ischaemic Heart Disease in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)
  presenting_complaint: Atypical chest pain and Raynaud's phenomenon.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female with SLE presented with chest pain; despite her young age, her chronic inflammatory state increased her cardiovascular risk. A CTCA revealed premature coronary artery calcification and a significant lesion in the circumflex artery. She was started on aggressive lipid-lowering therapy and antiplatelets to manage her accelerated atherosclerosis.

chronic_ischaemic_heart_disease_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Ischaemic Heart Disease with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
  presenting_complaint: Exertional breathlessness and wheeze.
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old male smoker with known COPD presented with worsening exercise tolerance. It was difficult to distinguish between respiratory and cardiac causes until a stress echo showed inducible ischaemia. He was managed with cardioselective beta-blockers (bisoprolol) and long-acting nitrates, which improved his exercise capacity without exacerbating his bronchospasm.
