  primary_diagnosis: Infective endocarditis secondary to IVDU
  presenting_complaint: Fever, rigors, and shortness of breath
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old male with a history of intravenous heroin use presented with a one-week history of pyrexia and lethargy. Examination revealed a new pansystolic murmur at the left sternal edge and splinter haemorrhages. Echocardiography demonstrated a 1.2cm vegetation on the tricuspid valve, and blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus. He required a 6-week course of intravenous flucloxacillin and addiction psychiatry input.

opioid_abuse_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Methadone toxicity with QTc prolongation
  presenting_complaint: Syncope and palpitations
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female on methadone 100mg daily for opioid dependence presented following a collapse. ECG revealed a QTc interval of 520ms and episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (Torsades de Pointes). Serum electrolytes were normal, but she admitted to taking extra methadone doses due to emotional stress. Her methadone dose was reduced, and she was switched to buprenorphine under specialist supervision.

  primary_diagnosis: Tramadol-induced seizure
  presenting_complaint: Witnessed tonic-clonic seizure
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old university student was brought to the ED after a first-time seizure during a party. He admitted to consuming 600mg of tramadol belonging to a flatmate for recreational purposes. Post-ictal period was prolonged, and he exhibited mild serotonergic features including hyperreflexia. CT head and subsequent EEG were normal, confirming a provoked seizure due to tramadol's lowering of the seizure threshold.

opioid_abuse_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Opioid-induced hyperalgesia
  presenting_complaint: Worsening widespread pain despite increasing morphine dose
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female with fibromyalgia had her oxycodone dose increased to 120mg daily over six months, yet reported her pain was becoming more intense and diffuse. Examination showed significant allodynia. A diagnosis of opioid-induced hyperalgesia was made rather than opioid tolerance. A multidisciplinary plan for a slow opioid taper combined with cognitive behavioural therapy and gabapentinoids resulted in a 40% reduction in reported pain scores.

opioid_abuse_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Spinal epidural abscess
  presenting_complaint: Severe midline back pain and bilateral leg weakness
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female with a history of injecting opioids into her neck and groin presented with a 3-day history of worsening lumbar pain and urinary retention. MRI of the spine revealed an epidural abscess at L3-L5 with cord compression. Inflammatory markers were significantly raised (CRP 210). She underwent emergency neurosurgical decompression and was started on long-term intravenous antibiotics.

opioid_abuse_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric accidental opioid ingestion
  presenting_complaint: Lethargy and "blue lips"
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old boy was brought to A&E after his mother found an empty blister pack of dihydrocodeine. The child was cyanosed with a respiratory rate of 6/min. He was immediately intubated and ventilated. A naloxone infusion was required for 12 hours due to the long half-life of the ingested tablets. He made a full recovery, and a safeguarding referral was initiated.

opioid_abuse_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Heroin-induced leucoencephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Progressive ataxia and slurred speech
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male who reported "chasing the dragon" (inhaling heroin vapour) presented with a two-week history of worsening balance and cognitive decline. MRI brain showed symmetrical white matter changes in the cerebellum and posterior cerebrum. Toxicology confirmed opioid metabolites. He was treated with antioxidants (Coenzyme Q10 and Vitamin E), but remained with significant permanent neurological deficits.

opioid_abuse_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema post-naloxone
  presenting_complaint: Acute shortness of breath and pink frothy sputum
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old male was treated for a severe heroin overdose with a rapid bolus of 2mg naloxone. Shortly after regaining consciousness, he became acutely dyspnoeic with bilateral crackles on auscultation. Chest X-ray showed diffuse alveolar infiltrates consistent with flash pulmonary oedema. He required CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) for 18 hours in the ICU before his respiratory status normalised.

opioid_abuse_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Opioid dependence in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Routine antenatal booking with history of drug use
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old pregnant female (14 weeks gestation) disclosed a 2-gram-a-day heroin habit. She was referred to the specialist "vulnerable pregnancy" clinic. She was stabilised on oral methadone solution to prevent cycles of withdrawal and overdose, which pose a risk to the foetus. The pregnancy proceeded to term with a healthy delivery, though the infant required monitoring for mild NAS.

  presenting_complaint: Painful, pulsating lump in the right groin
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male IVDU presented with a 4cm tender, pulsatile mass in his right groin at an injection site. Duplex ultrasound confirmed a pseudoaneurysm of the common femoral artery with an associated overlying abscess. He underwent emergency vascular surgery for arterial repair and debridement of infected tissue. He was advised on harm reduction and the risks of "groin injecting."

opioid_abuse_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Occupational opioid misuse
  presenting_complaint: Tremors and sweating during a hospital shift
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old staff nurse was found distressed in the staff toilets. She eventually admitted to diverted use of liquid morphine (Oramorph) from the ward stocks over the last 12 months to cope with work stress. She was experiencing acute withdrawal due to a missed dose. She was suspended pending a fitness-to-practise investigation and referred to a specialist practitioner health programme for addiction treatment.

opioid_abuse_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Hepatitis C with liver cirrhosis
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice and abdominal swelling
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with a 30-year history of intravenous opioid abuse presented with yellowing of the sclera and ascites. He had never been screened for blood-borne viruses. Testing confirmed Hepatitis C (Genotype 1) with high viral load and cirrhosis on FibroScan. He was commenced on direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy while being supported by a needle exchange programme to prevent re-infection.

  primary_diagnosis: Compartment syndrome following overdose
  presenting_complaint: Severe pain and swelling of the left forearm
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male was found by police after being "down" for an estimated 12 hours following a heroin overdose. After initial resuscitation, he complained of excruciating pain in his left arm. The limb was tense and cold, with a creatine kinase (CK) of 15,000 U/L. Emergency fasciotomy was performed for acute compartment syndrome caused by prolonged limb compression during his period of unconsciousness.

opioid_abuse_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Dual diagnosis (Schizophrenia and Opioid Abuse)
  presenting_complaint: Auditory hallucinations and heroin craving
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male with known paranoid schizophrenia was admitted following a relapse into heroin use. He reported using opioids to "quiet the voices," but this had led to neglect of his antipsychotic medication. He was managed on an inpatient psychiatric ward with a combined regimen of methadone stabilisation and restarted risperidone. Integrated care between mental health and addiction services was established for his discharge.
