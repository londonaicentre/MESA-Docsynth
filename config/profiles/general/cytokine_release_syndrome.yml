He remained stable on the ward and completed his treatment cycle.

cytokine_release_syndrome_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Grade 2 Cytokine Release Syndrome in a Frail Patient
  presenting_complaint: Fever, tachycardia, and mild confusion.
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old female with significant ischaemic heart disease developed CRS following Glofitamab for DLBCL. Due to her cardiac history, the resulting tachycardia triggered a brief episode of atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. She was managed with tocilizumab and a short-term beta-blocker, avoiding progression to more severe haemodynamic instability.

cytokine_release_syndrome_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Cytokine Release Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Persistent high fever and escalating oxygen requirements.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with refractory mantle cell lymphoma failed to respond to two doses of tocilizumab and corticosteroids after CAR-T infusion. His ferritin levels peaked at 15,000 ng/mL, suggesting secondary HLH. He was successfully salvaged with etoposide and anakinra, though his hospital stay was prolonged by three weeks in the ICU.

  primary_diagnosis: Grade 1 Cytokine Release Syndrome (Paediatric)
  presenting_complaint: Low-grade fever and irritability.
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old girl with relapsed ALL developed a temperature of 38.4°C on day 4 post-CAR-T therapy. She remained haemodynamically stable and maintained normal oxygen saturations throughout. She was managed conservatively with paracetamol and close monitoring, with symptoms resolving spontaneously within 48 hours.

cytokine_release_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Cytokine Release Syndrome mimicking Bacterial Sepsis
  presenting_complaint: Rigors, hypotension, and elevated inflammatory markers.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male post-haploidentical stem cell transplant presented with sudden onset fever and a BP of 90/60 mmHg. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected neutropenic sepsis, his condition only improved after the administration of tocilizumab for presumed CRS. Subsequent cultures remained negative, supporting the diagnosis of transplant-related CRS.

cytokine_release_syndrome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Grade 3 Cytokine Release Syndrome with Capillary Leak Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Severe peripheral oedema, weight gain, and hypotension.
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old female receiving an experimental T-cell engager developed significant fluid retention and hypoalbuminaemia alongside Grade 3 CRS. She required intensive fluid management, albumin replacement, and tocilizumab to manage the systemic vascular leak. Her symptoms resolved over one week, though she required temporary diuretic support.

cytokine_release_syndrome_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Grade 2 Cytokine Release Syndrome (Outpatient Setting)
  presenting_complaint: Fever and dizziness at home.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male on a "step-up" dosing schedule for Epcoritamab presented to the emergency department with a fever of 39.1°C. He was admitted for observation and received one dose of tocilizumab due to persistent tachycardia. He was discharged 24 hours later after remaining afebrile and stable.

  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic Cytokine Release Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Sudden clinical deterioration in a patient with chronic inflammatory state.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female with underlying rheumatoid arthritis and myelodysplastic syndrome received a novel monoclonal antibody. She experienced an acute exacerbation of systemic inflammation, with CRP rising from a baseline of 40 mg/L to 310 mg/L. The presentation was managed as Grade 2 CRS with steroids and tocilizumab, requiring careful differentiation from a flare of her autoimmune disease.

cytokine_release_syndrome_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Grade 2 Cytokine Release Syndrome with Myocardial Injury
  presenting_complaint: Fever and chest tightness.
  summary_of_course: A 53-year-old male developed Grade 2 CRS following CAR-T therapy, notable for an associated troponin T rise to 450 ng/L and ECG changes. Echocardiography showed a transient reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction to 45%. Following tocilizumab and supportive care, his cardiac enzymes normalised and systolic function recovered within two weeks.

cytokine_release_syndrome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Grade 1 Cytokine Release Syndrome with Gastrointestinal Symptoms
  presenting_complaint: Fever, nausea, and profuse watery diarrhoea.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old female with Hodgkin lymphoma developed mild CRS after a bispecific T-cell engager infusion. Unusually, her primary symptoms alongside fever were gastrointestinal, which were initially thought to be infectious. Stool studies were negative, and the symptoms resolved promptly after a single dose of tocilizumab, confirming CRS-related gut inflammation.

cytokine_release_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Cytokine Release Syndrome (Phase I Trial)
  presenting_complaint: Rapid collapse and multi-organ failure.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old healthy volunteer in a Phase I trial of a T-cell agonist experienced near-immediate Grade 4 CRS. He developed profound hypotension and pulmonary oedema within 90 minutes of dosing. Rapid intervention with tocilizumab, steroids, and intensive care support saved his life, highlighting the risks of first-in-human immunotherapies.

  primary_diagnosis: Grade 2 Cytokine Release Syndrome with Coagulopathy
  presenting_complaint: Fever and spontaneous bruising.
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old female with DLBCL developed CRS on day 4 post-infusion, accompanied by a drop in fibrinogen to 0.8 g/L and prolonged PT/APTT. She was treated with tocilizumab and cryoprecipitate to manage the consumptive coagulopathy. Her clotting parameters normalised as the systemic inflammatory response subsided over the following 72 hours.

cytokine_release_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Grade 3 Cytokine Release Syndrome in Renal Impairment
  presenting_complaint: Fever, hypotension, and oliguria.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male with pre-existing Stage 4 CKD developed Grade 3 CRS following CAR-T therapy. The systemic inflammation triggered an acute-on-chronic kidney injury, necessitating temporary continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVH). He was treated aggressively with tocilizumab and dexamethasone, eventually returning to his baseline renal function after two weeks.
