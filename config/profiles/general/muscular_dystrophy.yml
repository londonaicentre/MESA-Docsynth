  presenting_complaint: Proximal muscle pain and early-onset cataracts
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old woman presented with chronic aching in her thighs and hips, initially misdiagnosed as fibromyalgia. Slit-lamp examination revealed iridescent "Christmas tree" cataracts, and genetic testing confirmed a CCTG expansion in the CNBP gene. Unlike DM1, her symptoms are primarily proximal and she lacks significant respiratory involvement.

muscular_dystrophy_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Distal muscular dystrophy (Miyoshi myopathy)
  presenting_complaint: Inability to stand on tiptoes
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male presented with isolated wasting of the gastrocnemius muscles and a markedly elevated CK of 12,000 U/L. Initial suspicion of inflammatory myopathy was ruled out by muscle biopsy showing dystrophic changes without inflammation. Genetic testing confirmed biallelic mutations in the DYSF gene (dysferlin).

muscular_dystrophy_012:
