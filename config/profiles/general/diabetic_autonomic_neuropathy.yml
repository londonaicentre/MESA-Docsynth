  presenting_complaint: Extremely dry, cracked skin on the feet
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with T2DM presented with recurrent neuropathic ulcers. Examination revealed distal anhidrosis and hyperkeratosis due to sympathetic denervation of sweat glands. Management focused on intensive emollients and podiatry input to prevent secondary infection and Charcot neuroarthropathy.

diabetic_autonomic_neuropathy_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic Oesophageal Dysmotility
  presenting_complaint: Dysphagia and retrosternal heaviness
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female with T1DM reported difficulty swallowing solids and liquids. Manometry showed reduced lower oesophageal sphincter pressure and multipeak contractions, consistent with autonomic oesophageal involvement. Managed with upright positioning after meals and small bolus sizes.

diabetic_autonomic_neuropathy_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Postprandial Hypotension
  presenting_complaint: Dizziness and fatigue 45 minutes after lunch
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with T2DM and hypertension experienced frequent post-meal falls. Ambulatory BP monitoring showed a 30 mmHg systolic drop specifically following carbohydrate-heavy meals. Managed by reducing meal size, increasing water intake before meals, and adjusting the timing of antihypertensive medications.
