  primary_diagnosis: Chronic non-union of C2 odontoid fracture
  presenting_complaint: Chronic neck pain and intermittent dizziness 6 months after a previously treated "stable" injury.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male had been managed in a hard collar for a Type II dens fracture. Follow-up CT at 6 months showed persistent fracture lines and pseudoarthrosis. Due to increasing instability and pain, he was scheduled for a salvage posterior C1-C2 fusion.
