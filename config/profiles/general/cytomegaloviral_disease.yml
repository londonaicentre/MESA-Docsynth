  primary_diagnosis: Congenital cytomegalovirus infection
  presenting_complaint: Neonatal jaundice, petechial rash, and microcephaly at birth.
  summary_of_course: A term neonate presented with intrauterine growth restriction and a "blueberry muffin" rash. Investigations revealed thrombocytopenia, conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia, and periventricular calcification on cranial ultrasound. CMV DNA was detected in the urine within 48 hours of birth; the infant commenced a six-month course of oral valganciclovir to mitigate sensorineural hearing loss.

cytomegaloviral_disease_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Cytomegalovirus mononucleosis
  presenting_complaint: Protracted fever, profound malaise, and cervical lymphadenopathy.
  summary_of_course: A previously healthy 24-year-old male presented with a three-week history of pyrexia of unknown origin. Monospot test was negative, but blood film showed atypical lymphocytosis and LFTs revealed mild transaminitis. CMV IgM and high-titre CMV DNA PCR confirmed primary infection, which was managed with supportive care and resolved over six weeks.

Immunosuppression was reduced and IV ganciclovir was administered for 21 days with good clinical response.

cytomegaloviral_disease_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Cytomegalovirus pneumonitis
  presenting_complaint: Non-productive cough, progressive dyspnoea, and low-grade fever.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female, three months post-allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant, developed acute respiratory distress. High-resolution CT showed bilateral ground-glass opacities, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was positive for CMV by PCR and cytology. Despite intensive treatment with IV ganciclovir and CMV-immunoglobulin, the patient required mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

cytomegaloviral_disease_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Cytomegalovirus oesophagitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe odynophagia and retrosternal chest pain.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old patient with advanced AIDS presented with an inability to swallow solids due to pain. Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) revealed large, shallow longitudinal ulcers in the distal oesophagus. Biopsies confirmed CMV infection, and the patient showed significant symptomatic improvement after two weeks of oral valganciclovir.

cytomegaloviral_disease_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Cytomegalovirus hepatitis
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice, anorexia, and right upper quadrant pain.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male undergoing chemotherapy for B-cell lymphoma developed acute derangement of liver function tests (ALT 450 U/L, Bilirubin 55 umol/L). Viral hepatitis screen (A-E) was negative, but liver biopsy demonstrated focal necrosis with CMV inclusions. He was treated with IV ganciclovir for 14 days, leading to the normalisation of transaminases.

cytomegaloviral_disease_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Cytomegalovirus encephalitis
  presenting_complaint: Acute confusion, personality changes, and new-onset seizures.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old severely immunocompromised patient presented with a rapid decline in Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS).

  primary_diagnosis: Cytomegalovirus-associated ulcerative colitis flare
  presenting_complaint: Exacerbation of bloody diarrhoea refractory to corticosteroids.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female with known ulcerative colitis was admitted with a severe flare that failed to respond to IV hydrocortisone. Flexible sigmoidoscopy and biopsy revealed CMV reactivation within the colonic mucosa. Following a course of IV ganciclovir, her symptoms stabilised, allowing for the successful introduction of infliximab.

cytomegaloviral_disease_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Critical illness-associated CMV reactivation
  presenting_complaint: Failure to wean from mechanical ventilation and persistent systemic inflammatory response.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old non-immunocompromised male was admitted to the ICU with faecal peritonitis and sepsis. On day 14, he developed unexplained pyrexia and worsening oxygenation; BAL and blood PCR confirmed high-load CMV reactivation. Treatment with ganciclovir was initiated, resulting in successful weaning from the ventilator five days later.

cytomegaloviral_disease_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary CMV infection in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Mild flu-like illness and low-grade fever at 14 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old primigravida presented with malaise; serology showed CMV IgG seroconversion and low IgG avidity, indicating primary infection. Amniocentesis performed at 20 weeks confirmed foetal infection via PCR. The pregnancy was closely monitored with serial ultrasounds, which eventually detected foetal ventriculomegaly and echogenic bowel.

cytomegaloviral_disease_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Ganciclovir-resistant cytomegaloviral disease
  presenting_complaint: Persistent fever and rising CMV viraemia despite standard antiviral therapy.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old liver transplant recipient with CMV syndrome failed to respond to three weeks of IV ganciclovir. Resistance testing identified a UL97 protein kinase mutation. The treatment was switched to foscarnet, which successfully cleared the viraemia, although the patient required monitoring for nephrotoxicity.

  primary_diagnosis: CMV-induced immune thrombocytopenia
  presenting_complaint: Spontaneous bruising and epistaxis in a 5-year-old child.
  summary_of_course: A previously well child presented with a petechial rash and a platelet count of 8 x 10^9/L. Investigations for secondary causes revealed a recent primary CMV infection (IgM positive, IgG low avidity). The thrombocytopenia was managed with IVIG and resolved as the viral infection cleared, without the need for antiviral drugs.

cytomegaloviral_disease_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Cytomegalovirus myocarditis
  presenting_complaint: Pleuritic chest pain and dyspnoea in a 21-year-old male.
  summary_of_course: An immunocompetent young adult presented with ST-elevation on ECG and raised troponin T (1200 ng/L). Coronary angiography was normal, but cardiac MRI showed epicardial enhancement consistent with myocarditis. CMV serology and blood PCR confirmed acute infection; he recovered with supportive management and NSAIDs.

  primary_diagnosis: Cutaneous cytomegaloviral vasculitis
  presenting_complaint: Non-blanching purpuric rash on the lower limbs.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male on chronic oral steroids for vasculitis developed a new petechial eruption. Skin biopsy revealed leucocytoclastic vasculitis with cytomegalic inclusions in the vascular endothelium. CMV PCR was positive, and the lesions resolved following a course of IV ganciclovir and steroid tapering.

cytomegaloviral_disease_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Atypical CMV infection in the elderly
  presenting_complaint: Unexplained weight loss, night sweats, and mild anaemia.
  summary_of_course: An 84-year-old female was investigated for suspected malignancy. Extensive imaging was negative, but bone marrow biopsy showed no malignancy and incidental CMV inclusions. Subsequent CMV PCR was high (50,000 copies/mL); she responded well to a cautious course of valganciclovir with resolution of constitutional symptoms.
