mitral_prolapse_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Pediatric Mitral Valve Prolapse
  presenting_complaint: Systolic murmur detected during febrile illness.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old girl was referred after a GP noted a murmur. TTE confirmed mild superior displacement of the posterior leaflet consistent with MVP but no significant regurgitation. Her parents were reassured, and she was cleared for all competitive sports with five-yearly follow-up.

mitral_prolapse_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Mitral Valve Prolapse with Atrial Fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Irregularly irregular pulse and palpitations.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with known MVP presented with new-onset palpitations. ECG confirmed atrial fibrillation (AF), likely secondary to left atrial enlargement from chronic MR. He was anticoagulated with apixaban and underwent successful DC cardioversion.

mitral_prolapse_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (Hypermobility Type) with MVP
  presenting_complaint: Joint hypermobility and postural dizziness.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female with EDS presented for cardiac screening. TTE showed classic MVP with redundant, thickened leaflets. Given her systemic hypermobility, she was advised on the risks of vascular complications and remains under joint rheumatology and cardiology review.

  presenting_complaint: Palpitations during high-intensity exercise.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old amateur triathlete presented for evaluation of exercise-induced thumping in his chest. TTE showed MVP with a "Pickelhaube sign" (high-velocity mid-systolic spike) on tissue Doppler of the lateral annulus. Exercise stress testing induced frequent PVCs, and he was advised to moderate his training intensity.

  primary_diagnosis: MVP exacerbated by Graves' Disease
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss, tremors, and severe palpitations.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with stable, mild MVP developed thyrotoxicosis. The hypermetabolic state exacerbated her MVP symptoms, leading to symptomatic tachycardia and increased MR volume. Her cardiac symptoms resolved once euthyroid state was achieved with carbimazole.

mitral_prolapse_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Mitral Valve Prolapse in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Routine obstetric review at 28 weeks gestation.

  primary_diagnosis: MVP with Giant Left Atrium
  presenting_complaint: Chronic cough and dysphagia.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with long-standing, untreated MVP presented with compressive symptoms. Imaging revealed a "giant left atrium" (diameter 9cm) secondary to chronic, severe, eccentric MR. He underwent mitral valve replacement and left atrial reduction surgery to alleviate the pressure on his oesophagus and bronchi.

mitral_prolapse_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Sudden Cardiac Arrest in Silent MVP
  presenting_complaint: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male collapsed while jogging; bystander CPR and AED shock for VF were successful. Post-arrest TTE showed previously undiagnosed bileaflet MVP with significant fibrosis of the papillary muscles on cardiac MRI. He received an ICD for secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death.

mitral_prolapse_020:
  primary_diagnosis: MVP with Pseudo-ischaemic ECG Changes
  presenting_complaint: Chest tightness and ST-segment depression on exercise.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female with MVP underwent an exercise tolerance test for atypical chest pain. The ECG showed inferolateral ST-depression, but subsequent coronary angiography showed normal coronary arteries. The ECG changes were attributed to the mechanical tugging of the prolapsing leaflets on the papillary muscles, a known diagnostic pitfall.
