achalasia_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Type II Achalasia
  presenting_complaint: Progressive dysphagia to solids and liquids with nocturnal regurgitation.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented with a 12-month history of retrosternal fullness and weight loss of 5kg. HRM revealed panesophageal pressurisation in >20% of swallows and an elevated IRP of 28 mmHg. He underwent a successful laparoscopic Heller's myotomy and Dor fundoplication with complete resolution of symptoms.

achalasia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Achalasia
  presenting_complaint: Chronic cough and recurrent chest infections.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old girl was initially treated for asthma before developing significant vomiting after meals. Barium swallow showed a classic 'bird’s beak' appearance and significant oesophageal stasis. She was managed with balloon dilatation under general anaesthetic, showing marked improvement in growth velocity post-procedure.

achalasia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Sigmoid Achalasia (Stage IV)
  presenting_complaint: Severe malnutrition and inability to swallow saliva.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with long-standing untreated achalasia presented with cachexia and dehydration. CT imaging revealed a massively dilated, tortuous 'sigmoid' oesophagus measuring 10cm in diameter. Due to her frailty and the severity of the anatomical distortion, she was managed with a permanent feeding gastrostomy.

achalasia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent Achalasia post-Heller’s Myotomy
  presenting_complaint: Return of dysphagia and retrosternal pain five years post-surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male reported a gradual return of symptoms after an initially successful HM. Repeat HRM confirmed an IRP of 22 mmHg, suggesting an incomplete myotomy or subsequent scarring. He was successfully treated with Per-Oral Endoscopic Myotomy (POEM) as a rescue therapy.

achalasia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Food Bolus Obstruction in Achalasia
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset total dysphagia and sialorrhoea after eating steak.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female presented to A&E with acute retrosternal distress. Emergency OGDS identified a large meat bolus in the distal oesophagus, which was removed, revealing an underlying tight lower oesophageal sphincter. Subsequent manometry confirmed previously undiagnosed Type II achalasia.

achalasia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Achalasia complicated by Aspiration Pneumonia
  presenting_complaint: Fever, productive cough, and worsening shortness of breath.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male with known achalasia presented with acute respiratory distress. CXR confirmed right lower lobe consolidation secondary to nocturnal aspiration of undigested food. Following antibiotic treatment, he underwent pneumatic dilatation to reduce the risk of further aspiration events.

achalasia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Pseudoachalasia (Oesophageal Adenocarcinoma)
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive dysphagia and 15kg weight loss over 3 months.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male presented with symptoms mimicking achalasia, but his age and rapid weight loss raised suspicion. While manometry showed an achalasia-like pattern, OGDS and endoscopic ultrasound revealed a T3N1 adenocarcinoma at the gastro-oesophageal junction. He was referred for neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgical resection.

achalasia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Type I Achalasia
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent chest pain and slow transit of food.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female presented with mild symptoms and minimal weight loss. HRM showed absent peristalsis and failed LOS relaxation without panesophageal pressurisation. She opted for conservative management with botulinum toxin injections, providing symptomatic relief for 9 months before requiring a repeat procedure.

achalasia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Type III (Spastic) Achalasia
  presenting_complaint: Severe, knife-like retrosternal chest pain during meals.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented with symptoms often mistaken for myocardial infarction. HRM demonstrated high-amplitude, spastic contractions in the distal oesophagus and an IRP of 35 mmHg. He underwent a long-segment POEM to address the spastic component, resulting in significant pain reduction.

achalasia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Achalasia in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Severe hyperemesis and inability to maintain hydration in the second trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old pregnant female (20 weeks) developed worsening dysphagia and weight loss. To avoid the risks of surgery during pregnancy, she was managed with endoscopic botulinum toxin injection under light sedation. This provided sufficient symptomatic relief to allow for adequate foetal growth until a definitive HM was performed postpartum.

achalasia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Achalasia managed medically
  presenting_complaint: Occasional sticking sensation behind the sternum.
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old male with comorbid severe cardiac disease was diagnosed with early-stage achalasia. Due to high surgical risk, he was started on Nifedipine (calcium channel blocker) before meals. This pharmacological approach provided moderate symptomatic control, allowing him to maintain his weight and avoid invasive intervention.

achalasia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary Achalasia (Chagas Disease)
  presenting_complaint: Dysphagia and palpitations.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male originally from Brazil presented with progressive swallowing difficulties and signs of heart failure. Serology was positive for Trypanosoma cruzi, and manometry confirmed aperistalsis. He was managed for both Chagasic cardiomyopathy and achalasia, requiring a combination of pneumatic dilatation and cardiac medical therapy.

achalasia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening Achalasia with Refeeding Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Extreme lethargy, BMI of 14, and total dysphagia.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with severe achalasia was admitted to the ICU for stabilisation of electrolyte imbalances (hypophosphataemia) during cautious refeeding via a nasojejunal tube. Once nutritionally optimised, he underwent an urgent Heller's myotomy. He has since regained 12kg and has returned to normal university life.

achalasia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Achalasia with Oesophageal Diverticulum
  presenting_complaint: Regurgitation of foul-smelling, undigested food.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old female with chronic achalasia was found to have a large epiphrenic diverticulum on barium swallow. The diverticulum had formed due to the high intraluminal pressures associated with the non-relaxing LOS. She underwent a combined procedure involving diverticulectomy and Heller's myotomy to resolve the stasis.

achalasia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Achalasia-associated Oesophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
  presenting_complaint: New onset of haematemesis in a patient with 25-year history of achalasia.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with long-standing achalasia presented with fresh blood in his vomit. Endoscopy revealed an ulcerated mass in the mid-oesophagus, confirmed as squamous cell carcinoma, likely arising from chronic mucosal irritation. He was staged and commenced on palliative radiotherapy due to the advanced nature of the tumour.

achalasia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute Achalasia post-Viral Infection
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset dysphagia following a severe flu-like illness.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female developed rapidly progressive dysphagia over six weeks following a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Investigations confirmed Type II achalasia, suggesting a possible autoimmune trigger or viral-induced plexitis. She responded excellently to a single session of 30mm pneumatic dilatation.

achalasia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Allgrove Syndrome (Triple A Syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Dysphagia, lack of tears (alacrima), and skin hyperpigmentation.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy presented with a triad of achalasia, alacrima, and adrenal insufficiency (ACTH resistance). Genetic testing confirmed a mutation in the AAAS gene. He required a multidisciplinary approach including hydrocortisone replacement, artificial tears, and a Heller's myotomy for his oesophageal symptoms.

achalasia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Achalasia with Oesophageal Perforation
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, severe chest pain and surgical emphysema post-procedure.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male underwent pneumatic dilatation (35mm balloon) for Type II achalasia. Immediately post-procedure, he developed excruciating retrosternal pain; a Gastrografin swallow confirmed a distal oesophageal leak. He was managed with an emergency covered metal stent and IV antibiotics, eventually recovering after a prolonged hospital stay.

achalasia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: End-stage Achalasia requiring Oesophagectomy
  presenting_complaint: Persistent dysphagia despite multiple dilatations and two prior myotomies.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with refractory achalasia and a non-functional, dilated oesophagus failed all conservative and endoscopic measures. After thorough MDT discussion, she underwent a total oesophagectomy with gastric pull-up. Although a major operation, it successfully restored her ability to eat and significantly improved her quality of life.

achalasia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Early Stage Achalasia (Incidental Finding)
  presenting_complaint: Occasional heartburn and mild chest discomfort.
  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old male underwent HRM as part of a workup for atypical reflux. Surprisingly, the results showed an IRP of 18 mmHg and 100% failed peristalsis, consistent with early Type I achalasia. He was placed under active surveillance with dietary modifications, as his symptoms were currently too mild to justify surgical intervention.
