  primary_diagnosis: Mandibular angle fracture
  presenting_complaint: Malocclusion and severe pain on jaw movement after an alleged assault.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male presented with trismus and a step-deformity in the dental arch. An orthopantomogram (OPG) showed a fracture through the left mandibular angle involving the third molar socket. He underwent ORIF via an intraoral approach with extraction of the impacted tooth, achieving stable occlusion.

  primary_diagnosis: Depressed "ping-pong" skull fracture
  presenting_complaint: Visible indentation of the cranium following an accidental drop.
  summary_of_course: A 4-month-old infant was brought to the paediatric emergency department with a smooth, inward-buckling deformity of the parietal bone. CT head confirmed a greenstick-type depressed fracture without intracranial haemorrhage. Due to the infant's age and lack of neurological deficits, the fracture was managed conservatively with spontaneous re-expansion noted at the six-week follow-up.

fracture_of_skull_facial_bones_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Basal skull fracture
  presenting_complaint: Clear fluid leaking from the nose (rhinorrhoea) and bruising behind the ears (Battle's sign).
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male fell from a ladder, sustaining a significant head injury. CT head revealed a fracture through the petrous temporal bone and pneumocephalus.

fracture_of_skull_facial_bones_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Mandibular non-union secondary to osteoradionecrosis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent jaw pain, instability, and an intraoral discharging sinus.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with a history of radiotherapy for oropharyngeal carcinoma had previously undergone ORIF for a mandibular body fracture. Clinical and radiological review six months later showed a lack of bony bridging and hardware failure. He required radical debridement and reconstruction with a vascularised fibular free flap.

  primary_diagnosis: Zygomaticomaxillary complex (ZMC) fracture
  presenting_complaint: Flattening of the cheekbone and difficulty opening the mouth.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male was punched during a rugby match, resulting in a "tripod" fracture of the malar complex. CT scans showed displacement at the zygomaticofrontal, zygomaticomaxillary, and zygomaticotemporal sutures. He underwent a two-point fixation via subciliary and buccal sulcus incisions to restore facial projection.

fracture_of_skull_facial_bones_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Frontal sinus fracture (anterior table)
  presenting_complaint: Forehead depression and localized tenderness following a blunt impact.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male sustained a forehead injury during a football game. CT imaging demonstrated a comminuted fracture of the anterior table of the frontal sinus with no posterior table involvement or nasofrontal duct obstruction. The patient opted for conservative management, accepting a minor cosmetic contour deformity.

fracture_of_skull_facial_bones_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Panfacial fractures
  presenting_complaint: Severe facial trauma with multiple lacerations and airway compromise.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old construction worker was hit by falling debris, sustaining fractures to the mandible, maxilla, zygomas, and nasal bones. After emergency tracheostomy and stabilization, he underwent multi-stage reconstructive surgery using "bottom-up, outside-in" sequencing. Despite successful bony union, he required long-term speech and language therapy.

fracture_of_skull_facial_bones_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Temporal bone fracture (transverse)
  presenting_complaint: Immediate facial nerve palsy and profound sensorineural hearing loss following a road accident.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male presented with a House-Brackmann Grade VI facial palsy and vertigo. High-resolution CT confirmed a transverse fracture through the internal auditory canal. He was treated with high-dose corticosteroids and later underwent facial nerve decompression, achieving partial recovery of motor function.

  primary_diagnosis: Infected mandibular fracture with osteomyelitis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent swelling and purulent discharge from a previous surgical site.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old heavy smoker with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes presented four weeks after ORIF for a symphyseal fracture. Investigations revealed hardware infection and localized osteomyelitis of the fracture margins. Treatment involved removal of the plates, long-term IV antibiotics, and external fixation until the infection cleared.

fracture_of_skull_facial_bones_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Orbital roof fracture
  presenting_complaint: Upper eyelid haematoma and "raccoon eyes" in a young child.
  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old girl fell onto the corner of a coffee table. CT imaging showed an isolated fracture of the left orbital roof with a small superior subperiosteal haematoma. She was admitted for 24-hour neurological observation; the haematoma remained stable and she was discharged with ophthalmology follow-up.

  primary_diagnosis: Mandibular condyle fracture (subcondylar)
  presenting_complaint: Ear pain and inability to close the back teeth together.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female fainted and struck her chin on the floor. While initial A&E X-rays were reported as normal, persistent malocclusion led to a CT scan revealing a displaced right subcondylar fracture. She was managed with a brief period of intermaxillary fixation (IMF) followed by intensive physiotherapy to restore her range of motion.

fracture_of_skull_facial_bones_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Maxillary tuberosity fracture
  presenting_complaint: Movement of a large segment of the upper jaw during a difficult dental extraction.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male was undergoing extraction of a lone standing upper molar in primary care. The dentist felt a sudden "crack," and a large segment of the posterior maxilla became mobile. The procedure was aborted, the segment was stabilized with a splint, and the patient was referred to Oral and Maxillofacial surgery for management of the oroantral communication.

fracture_of_skull_facial_bones_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Naso-ethmoid-orbital (NOE) fracture (Type II)
  presenting_complaint: Widening of the bridge of the nose (telecanthus) and epistaxis.
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old male was involved in a high-speed collision. Examination revealed a traumatic telecanthus and a "doughy" feel to the nasal bridge. CT showed comminution of the central fragment of the frontal process of the maxilla. He underwent ORIF with transnasal wiring to reattach the medial canthal tendons.

fracture_of_skull_facial_bones_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Comminuted vault fracture with extradural haematoma
  presenting_complaint: Reduced GCS and a large scalp laceration following a blow with a heavy object.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male was brought to the ED with a GCS of 9. CT head showed a comminuted fracture of the right parietal bone with an underlying 3cm biconvex extradural haematoma. He underwent emergency craniotomy for evacuation of the clot and primary repair of the skull fragments.

  primary_diagnosis: Isolated coronoid process fracture
  presenting_complaint: Pain on opening the mouth and limited mandibular excursion.
  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old male sustained a direct blow to the side of the face. Clinical examination showed no malocclusion but significant trismus. A CT scan revealed an isolated fracture of the left coronoid process, likely due to sudden reflex contraction of the temporalis muscle. This was managed conservatively with early mobilisation and soft diet.

fracture_of_skull_facial_bones_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Occipital condyle fracture (Anderson-Montesano Type III)
  presenting_complaint: Severe neck pain and lower cranial nerve palsies (IX, X, XII) following a fall.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female presented after a fall in her care home. MRI and CT imaging demonstrated an avulsion fracture of the occipital condyle by the alar ligament. Due to the risk of craniocervical instability, she was treated with a halo vest for twelve weeks, followed by a hard cervical collar.

  primary_diagnosis: Sphenoid bone fracture
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of visual loss and ophthalmoplegia following severe head trauma.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male was crushed by heavy machinery. CT showed a fracture through the body of the sphenoid bone and the optic canal. Despite emergency optic nerve decompression and high-dose steroids, the patient's vision did not recover, resulting in permanent monocular blindness.
