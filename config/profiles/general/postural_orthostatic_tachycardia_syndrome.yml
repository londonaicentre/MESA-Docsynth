  presenting_complaint: Orthostatic intolerance following major orthopaedic surgery
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old woman developed acute POTS symptoms during her recovery from a total hip arthroplasty. The prolonged period of bed rest led to significant deconditioning, which unmasked a latent autonomic sensitivity. A structured "Dallas" bed-to-standing exercise protocol was implemented by the physiotherapy team, leading to resolution of symptoms within three months.

postural_orthostatic_tachycardia_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent hospital admissions for syncope and dehydration
  summary_of_course: A 23-year-old female with a "complex" medical history including Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) was frequently admitted to the ICU with profound autonomic instability. Her POTS was highly volatile, with minor triggers leading to severe tachycardia and syncope. Management required an integrated care plan involving immunology and cardiology, using H1/H2 blockers alongside ivabradine.

postural_orthostatic_tachycardia_syndrome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Workplace impairment and safety concerns in a nurse
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old theatre nurse reported near-syncope during long surgical cases. Occupational health screening confirmed POTS, raising concerns about her safety in the operating environment. Following the introduction of pharmacological management (midodrine) and the use of Class II compression stockings, she was able to return to full duties with the provision of a stool for use during static standing.

postural_orthostatic_tachycardia_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Diagnostic uncertainty with borderline tilt table results
  summary_of_course: A 20-year-old female presented with symptoms highly suggestive of POTS, but her initial tilt table test was inconclusive with a 28 bpm rise. A repeat test with provocation (isoprenaline) or after a period of fluid restriction confirmed a significant postural rise of 42 bpm. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge of fluctuating symptoms and the potential need for repeat testing in clinically suspected POTS.
