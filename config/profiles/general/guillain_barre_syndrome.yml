  primary_diagnosis: Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive bilateral leg weakness and tingling in the feet.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented with a 3-day history of ascending paralysis following a respiratory tract infection. Neurological examination revealed absent ankle and knee reflexes with 3/5 power in the lower limbs. Lumbar puncture showed albuminocytologic dissociation (protein 1.2 g/L, white cells 2/mm³), and he was successfully treated with a 5-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg).

guillain_barre_syndrome_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Miller Fisher Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Double vision, unsteady gait, and loss of coordination.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old female presented with acute onset of diplopia and ataxia. Clinical findings included ophthalmoplegia, prominent gait ataxia, and global areflexia. Serum testing was positive for anti-GQ1b antibodies, confirming the diagnosis, and she made a full recovery with supportive care and IVIg.

guillain_barre_syndrome_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Guillain-Barré Syndrome with respiratory failure
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressing limb weakness and shortness of breath.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male was admitted to the ICU after his Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) dropped to 15ml/kg within 24 hours of admission. He required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation for three weeks. Following five sessions of plasmapheresis and intensive physiotherapy, he was successfully weaned and transferred to a rehabilitation unit.

guillain_barre_syndrome_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Guillain-Barré Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Refusal to walk and irritability.
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old girl presented with sudden onset of leg pain and inability to bear weight two weeks after a viral gastroenteritis. Examination showed hypotonia and absent lower limb reflexes. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) confirmed a demyelinating polyneuropathy, and she responded well to a single course of IVIg with return to baseline mobility within six weeks.

guillain_barre_syndrome_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Motor Axonal Neuropathy (AMAN)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of symmetric weakness in all four limbs.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male presented with rapid-onset quadriparesis one week after a confirmed Campylobacter jejuni infection. NCS demonstrated reduced compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes with preserved sensory potentials, consistent with the AMAN variant. Despite early IVIg treatment, recovery was slow, requiring six months of intensive neuro-rehabilitation.

guillain_barre_syndrome_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Pharyngeal-Cervical-Brachial variant of GBS
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty swallowing and weakness in the neck and arms.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old female presented with acute oropharyngeal weakness and bilateral ptosis, initially raising suspicion of Myasthenia Gravis. However, the presence of neck flexor weakness and areflexia in the upper limbs, combined with high CSF protein, led to a diagnosis of the PCB variant of GBS. She was treated with IVIg and required temporary nasogastric feeding.

guillain_barre_syndrome_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Guillain-Barré Syndrome with profound autonomic dysfunction
  presenting_complaint: Weakness accompanied by severe palpitations and lightheadedness.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with classic ascending paralysis developed significant haemodynamic instability, characterised by alternating sinus tachycardia and bradycardia. He required a temporary cardiac pacemaker and invasive blood pressure monitoring in the ICU. His motor symptoms improved with IVIg, and autonomic stability returned after four weeks.

guillain_barre_syndrome_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Guillain-Barré Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Persistent numbness in fingers and toes with mild tripping.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female presented with subacute sensory changes and Grade 4+ power in the distal lower limbs. NCS showed mild demyelinating features, but as she remained ambulatory and her FVC was stable, she was managed with close outpatient monitoring. Her symptoms plateaued at week three and resolved spontaneously over the following two months.

guillain_barre_syndrome_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Motor-Sensory Axonal Neuropathy (AMSAN)
  presenting_complaint: Total loss of movement and sensation in all limbs.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male presented with a fulminant course of GBS, progressing to tetraplegia and sensory loss within 48 hours. NCS showed severe axonal degeneration in both motor and sensory nerves. Despite multiple rounds of plasmapheresis, he was left with significant permanent neurological deficits and remains wheelchair-dependent.

guillain_barre_syndrome_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Treatment-Related Fluctuation (TRF) in GBS
  presenting_complaint: Initial improvement in walking followed by a sudden relapse.
  summary_of_course: A 47-year-old male initially responded well to IVIg for moderate GBS, regaining the ability to walk. Ten days later, he experienced a secondary decline in motor function and was diagnosed with a TRF. A second course of IVIg was administered, leading to sustained clinical improvement and eventual discharge.

guillain_barre_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Facial Diplegia and Paresthesia variant
  presenting_complaint: Inability to close both eyes and drooping of both sides of the face.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male presented with bilateral facial nerve palsy and distal limb paresthesia but preserved limb strength. Differential diagnoses included Sarcoidosis and Lyme disease, but CSF analysis and NCS findings were typical for GBS. He was treated with IVIg, and facial nerve function returned to normal over three months.

guillain_barre_syndrome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Guillain-Barré Syndrome in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Progressive leg weakness in the third trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old woman at 32 weeks gestation presented with ascending paralysis and areflexia. Management was coordinated between neurology and obstetrics; she received IVIg, which is safe in pregnancy, and remained stable. She underwent a successful elective Caesarean section at 37 weeks, and her neurological symptoms continued to improve postpartum.

guillain_barre_syndrome_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-onset Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (A-CIDP)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of weakness over three months.
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old male initially presented with what appeared to be acute GBS and was treated with IVIg. However, he experienced three further relapses beyond the typical 8-week window for GBS. Maintenance therapy with corticosteroids and regular IVIg was initiated, and the diagnosis was revised to A-CIDP.

guillain_barre_syndrome_014:
  primary_diagnosis: HIV-associated Guillain-Barré Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive weakness and fever.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male with a new diagnosis of HIV presented with acute ascending paralysis. Unusually for GBS, his CSF showed a significant pleocytosis (50 cells/mm³), which is a known feature of GBS in the context of HIV seroconversion. He was treated with IVIg and started on antiretroviral therapy, with good neurological recovery.

guillain_barre_syndrome_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-Vaccination Guillain-Barré Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Weakness in the legs 14 days after an influenza vaccination.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male developed progressive difficulty climbing stairs and numbness in his hands two weeks after his annual flu jab. Clinical evaluation and CSF protein of 0.9 g/L confirmed GBS. He received a 5-day course of IVIg and made a full recovery, with the event reported to the Yellow Card scheme.

guillain_barre_syndrome_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Guillain-Barré Syndrome with severe neuropathic pain
  presenting_complaint: Agonising burning pain in the legs and mild weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female presented with lower limb weakness that was overshadowed by intractable radicular and neuropathic pain. While her motor symptoms were moderate, her pain required management with high-dose gabapentin and amitriptyline alongside IVIg. The pain gradually subsided as her motor function improved during rehabilitation.

guillain_barre_syndrome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute Guillain-Barré Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Slow but steady decline in walking ability over 4 weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male presented with a 4-week history of progressive leg heaviness and loss of balance. Because the progression exceeded the typical 2-week nadir, spinal stenosis was initially suspected. MRI was clear, and NCS/CSF findings confirmed a subacute demyelinating polyneuropathy consistent with GBS, responding well to IVIg.

guillain_barre_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Guillain-Barré Syndrome mimicking brainstem stroke
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of slurred speech, swallowing difficulty, and limb weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with hypertension was brought to the emergency department as a suspected stroke. Brain MRI was normal, but the development of ascending areflexic paralysis led to a diagnosis of GBS. Despite his age and comorbidities, he tolerated IVIg well and regained independent mobility after three months.

guillain_barre_syndrome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Zika virus-associated Guillain-Barré Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Fever and rash followed by bilateral hand and leg weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old male returned from South America with a viral prodrome followed by acute polyneuropathy. Serum PCR was positive for Zika virus. He developed moderate weakness (Grade 3/5) and was treated with plasmapheresis, resulting in a gradual recovery over several months.

guillain_barre_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Treatment-refractory Guillain-Barré Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Non-response to initial IVIg with worsening respiratory status.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female with severe GBS showed no clinical improvement after an initial course of IVIg and continued to deteriorate, requiring ventilation. A subsequent course of plasmapheresis was initiated as a rescue therapy. She eventually began to improve after a prolonged 8-week ICU stay but was left with significant distal atrophy.
