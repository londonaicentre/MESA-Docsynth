gout_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute gouty arthritis (podagra)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset severe pain and swelling of the right great toe.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with a high purine diet presented to the GP with exquisite tenderness and erythema of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. Serum urate was 520 μmol/L. He was treated with a five-day course of Naproxen 500mg BD and lifestyle advice, resulting in complete resolution of symptoms within 48 hours.

gout_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic tophaceous gout
  presenting_complaint: Persistent joint stiffness and painless lumps on the fingers and ears.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male with long-standing untreated hyperuricaemia and CKD stage 3 presented with chalky white deposits (tophi) on his distal interphalangeal joints. Radiographs showed characteristic "punched-out" erosions with sclerotic margins. He was commenced on Febuxostat 80mg daily as Allopurinol was previously poorly tolerated, with gradual reduction in tophi size over 12 months.

gout_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Polyarticular gouty flare
  presenting_complaint: Multiple swollen, painful joints including both ankles and the left wrist.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female with a history of thiazide diuretic use for hypertension presented with an acute polyarticular flare. Initial presentation mimicked rheumatoid arthritis, but joint aspiration of the ankle confirmed needle-shaped negatively birefringent monosodium urate crystals. She required a tapering dose of oral Prednisolone and Colchicine 500mcg BD to manage the systemic inflammatory response.

gout_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic gout
  presenting_complaint: Worsening knee pain and swelling following a recent hospitalisation for pneumonia.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male on maintenance Allopurinol 300mg daily experienced a flare in his left knee during recovery from a chest infection. Dehydration and acute illness triggered the episode; his Allopurinol was continued, and a short course of Colchicine was added. Symptoms subsided once fluid balance was restored and inflammation controlled.

gout_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary gout due to tumour lysis syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Acute oliguria and bilateral foot pain following chemotherapy.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old male undergoing induction chemotherapy for Burkitt lymphoma developed rapid hyperuricaemia (urate >900 μmol/L). He developed acute gouty arthritis in both feet alongside acute kidney injury. He was transferred to the ICU for Rasburicase administration and haemofiltration, leading to a rapid decline in urate levels and resolution of joint pain.

gout_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Allopurinol Hypersensitivity Syndrome (DRESS)
  presenting_complaint: Widespread maculopapular rash, fever, and jaundice two weeks after starting gout treatment.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with gout and pre-existing renal impairment was started on Allopurinol 100mg. He developed a severe cutaneous adverse reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), including deranged LFTs. Allopurinol was immediately ceased, and he was treated with high-dose steroids; subsequent gout management was switched to Benzbromarone under specialist supervision.

gout_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Axial gout (spinal gout)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic lower back pain and progressive lower limb weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with a 20-year history of tophaceous gout presented with neurological symptoms mimicking spinal stenosis. MRI and subsequent CT-guided biopsy of the L4/L5 facet joints revealed urate crystal deposition causing cord compression. He underwent decompressive laminectomy and aggressive urate-lowering therapy to prevent recurrence.

gout_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Early-onset gout (Lesch-Nyhan variant)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent joint pain and gravel-like material in the nappy/urine since childhood.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with mild developmental delay and a history of self-mutilation presented with acute podagra. Genetic testing confirmed a partial deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). He was stabilised on high-dose Allopurinol and intensive hydration to prevent urate nephropathy.

gout_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Gouty olecranon bursitis
  presenting_complaint: Large, fluctuant, red swelling over the left elbow.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old manual labourer presented with a suspected septic bursa. Aspiration yielded "creamy" fluid which, under polarised light microscopy, was packed with MSU crystals; cultures were negative for infection. The patient was treated with a local corticosteroid injection and oral NSAIDs, with rapid resolution of the bursal swelling.

gout_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Septic arthritis mimicking gout
  presenting_complaint: Fever, rigors, and a severely painful, swollen right knee.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with known gout presented with an acute flare; however, he was also pyrexial with a CRP of 250 mg/L. Joint aspiration revealed MSU crystals but also Gram-positive cocci on staining, confirming a concurrent septic arthritis (Staphylococcus aureus). He required emergency surgical washout and a six-week course of intravenous Flucloxacillin alongside his gout management.

gout_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory tophaceous gout
  presenting_complaint: Discharging tophi on the small joints of the hands.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male failed to achieve target urate levels (<300 μmol/L) despite maximum doses of Allopurinol and Febuxostat. He suffered from frequent, debilitating flares and ulcerating tophi. He was initiated on Pegloticase infusions in a specialist centre, which successfully rapidly depleted the urate pool and healed the skin ulcerations.

gout_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic gout
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent foot pain after starting low-dose Aspirin and Furosemide.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old female with heart failure developed her first episode of gout involving the midfoot. Her medications included Furosemide and low-dose Aspirin, both of which decrease renal urate excretion. Her Furosemide was switched to Bumetanide where possible, and she was started on a low-dose urate-lowering agent with Colchicine prophylaxis.

gout_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute gouty arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent, low-grade grumbling pain and swelling in the left ankle for three weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old male presented with a subacute presentation that was initially misdiagnosed as an ankle sprain. Physical examination showed mild synovitis and warmth. Serum urate was borderline at 380 μmol/L, but ultrasound showed the "double contour sign" on the articular cartilage, confirming gout.

gout_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Gout in a pre-menopausal female
  presenting_complaint: Acute swelling of the wrist and thumb base.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and obesity presented with an atypical location for gout. Investigations revealed significant metabolic syndrome and hyperuricaemia, likely exacerbated by insulin resistance. She responded well to Indometacin and was referred for weight management and endocrine follow-up.

gout_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Urate nephrolithiasis
  presenting_complaint: Severe left-sided loin-to-groin pain and haematuria.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with a history of frequent gouty flares presented with acute renal colic. Non-contrast CT KUB identified a radiolucent stone in the ureter, which was confirmed as a uric acid calculus. Management involved urinary alkalinisation with potassium citrate and starting Allopurinol to reduce the stone burden.

gout_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-transplant gout
  presenting_complaint: Acute pain in the right tarsal joints three months after renal transplant.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male on Ciclosporin for immunosuppression developed severe hyperuricaemia. Ciclosporin is known to inhibit urate excretion, leading to "accelerated" gout. His immunosuppression was reviewed, and he was started on cautious doses of Allopurinol with close monitoring of his renal function and graft status.

gout_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe systemic gouty inflammatory syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, high fever, and multiple swollen joints in an elderly patient.
  summary_of_course: An 84-year-old frail female was admitted with suspected sepsis. Investigations showed a massive polyarticular gout flare involving six joints, causing a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). She was treated with intravenous fluids and Anakinra (IL-1 inhibitor) as NSAIDs and steroids were contraindicated due to GI bleeding risk and heart failure.

gout_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Intercritical gout
  presenting_complaint: Routine follow-up for a patient with previous gouty episodes.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male, currently asymptomatic, attended for a medication review. He had two flares in the previous year but was not yet on urate-lowering therapy. His urate remained high at 490 μmol/L; after discussion of the risks of joint damage, he elected to start Allopurinol 100mg with a plan for titration to target.

gout_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Gouty panniculitis
  presenting_complaint: Tender, erythematous nodules on the lower legs resembling cellulitis.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with severe tophaceous gout presented with skin lesions on his shins. Biopsy of the nodules revealed deposition of urate crystals within the subcutaneous fat, a rare manifestation known as gouty panniculitis. The lesions resolved only after aggressive lowering of serum urate levels below 300 μmol/L.

gout_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcohol-induced acute gout
  presenting_complaint: Exquisite pain in the left great toe following a wedding celebration.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male presented with classic podagra after a weekend of heavy beer consumption and seafood. The ethanol-induced lactic acidosis had competed with urate for renal excretion, triggering the flare. He was treated with Diclofenac and advised on the specific link between beer (high in guanosine) and gout risk.
