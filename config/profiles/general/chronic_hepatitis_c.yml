  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old MSM (men who have sex with men) on stable ART for HIV presented with ALT 120 U/L and AST 95 U/L. Screening confirmed acute-on-chronic Hepatitis C (Genotype 1a) likely acquired through high-risk sexual contact. Management required careful review of drug-drug interactions between his HIV protease inhibitors and proposed HCV DAAs, eventually successfully treated with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir.

chronic_hepatitis_c_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Hepatocellular Carcinoma complicating Chronic Hepatitis C
  presenting_complaint: Right upper quadrant pain and unexplained weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with known Hepatitis C related cirrhosis (F4) and poor follow-up presented with a 4kg weight loss. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was significantly elevated at 450 ng/mL, and triple-phase CT identified a 3.5cm arterial-enhancing lesion with venous washout in segment VI. He was referred to the multidisciplinary team for consideration of TACE (transarterial chemoembolisation) followed by curative antiviral therapy.

chronic_hepatitis_c_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Hepatitis C (Genotype 3) with DAA Treatment Failure
  presenting_complaint: Persistence of HCV RNA 12 weeks after completing antiviral therapy.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with compensated cirrhosis (F4) initially completed a 12-week course of Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir. Post-treatment screening at 12 weeks (SVR12) showed a relapse of HCV RNA (Genotype 3).

  presenting_complaint: Referral from GP following maternal diagnosis of Hepatitis C.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old boy, born to a mother with a history of IVDU, was screened for the first time. He was found to be HCV RNA positive (Genotype 1b) with normal transaminases and a FibroScan score of 4.1 kPa. Following UK paediatric guidelines, he was started on a weight-based regimen of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir, which he tolerated well, achieving SVR12.

chronic_hepatitis_c_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Hepatitis C with Porphyria Cutanea Tarda (PCT)
  presenting_complaint: Blistering lesions on the backs of hands and tea-coloured urine.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male presented with skin fragility and vesicles on sun-exposed areas. Elevated urinary porphyrins and positive HCV serology (Genotype 1a) confirmed PCT triggered by chronic Hepatitis C. He was managed with small-volume phlebotomy to reduce iron stores and concurrent DAA therapy, which led to the complete resolution of skin lesions.

chronic_hepatitis_c_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Hepatitis C in a Renal Transplant Recipient
  presenting_complaint: Abnormal liver enzymes found during routine post-transplant clinic.
  summary_of_course: A 49-year-old female, three years post-renal transplant for IgA nephropathy, was found to have chronic Hepatitis C (likely nosocomial acquisition historically). There were concerns regarding graft function and interactions with Tacrolimus. She was successfully treated with Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir for 8 weeks with close monitoring of immunosuppressant levels, achieving SVR without compromising the renal allograft.

chronic_hepatitis_c_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) triggered by SBP in HCV Cirrhosis
  presenting_complaint: Fever, severe abdominal pain, and rapidly worsening jaundice.
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old male with known HCV cirrhosis presented to A&E with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Ascitic tap confirmed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) with a neutrophil count of 450 cells/mm³. Despite aggressive antibiotics and albumin, he developed Hepatorenal Syndrome (Type 1) and was admitted to ICU for vasopressor support and continuous renal replacement therapy.

chronic_hepatitis_c_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Hepatitis C with Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis (MPGN)
  presenting_complaint: Generalised oedema and foamy urine.
  summary_of_course: A 53-year-old female presented with nephrotic-range proteinuria (6g/24h) and haematuria. Renal biopsy demonstrated MPGN, and further testing revealed chronic Hepatitis C (Genotype 2a) with associated cryoglobulinaemia. Treatment with DAAs resulted in virological clearance and a significant reduction in proteinuria, though she required a short course of corticosteroids for the initial renal flare.

chronic_hepatitis_c_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Hepatitis C (Genotype 4) in an Immigrant Patient
  presenting_complaint: Screened as part of a new migrant health check.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male recently arrived from Egypt was found to be HCV antibody positive. RNA testing confirmed Genotype 4 infection, which is prevalent in his country of origin. FibroScan showed moderate fibrosis (F2, 8.5 kPa), and he was treated with a standard course of Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir, achieving SVR12 with no adverse effects.

chronic_hepatitis_c_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Hepatitis C with Severe Oesophageal Variceal Haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Haematemesis and melaena with haemodynamic instability.
  summary_of_course: A 57-year-old male with previously undiagnosed Hepatitis C presented in hypovolaemic shock. Emergency endoscopy revealed Grade III oesophageal varices with active bleeding, which were successfully banded. Post-stabilisation, he was diagnosed with HCV-related cirrhosis (Genotype 3) and commenced on carvedilol for portal hypertension and DAAs for the underlying infection.

chronic_hepatitis_c_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Hepatitis C with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
  presenting_complaint: Night sweats, weight loss, and palpable cervical lymphadenopathy.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male was diagnosed with B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. Routine pre-chemotherapy screening revealed chronic Hepatitis C (Genotype 1b). Given the association between HCV and lymphoproliferative disorders, he received concurrent antiviral therapy alongside his R-CHOP regimen, which contributed to a robust haematological remission.

chronic_hepatitis_c_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Hepatitis C in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Positive HCV screen during first-trimester antenatal booking.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old pregnant female was found to be HCV RNA positive. As DAAs are not currently licensed for use in pregnancy in the UK, she was monitored with LFTs throughout her term and referred for specialist hepatology follow-up post-partum. She successfully breastfed and commenced Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir 6 months post-delivery, achieving SVR.

chronic_hepatitis_c_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Hepatitis C with Heavy Alcohol Comorbidity
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice and tender hepatomegaly following a heavy drinking binge.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with known chronic Hepatitis C (Genotype 3) and alcohol dependence presented with clinical alcoholic hepatitis (Maddrey’s Discriminant Function >32). He was treated with a course of prednisolone for the acute alcoholic component. Once the acute episode resolved and he achieved abstinence, he was treated for his HCV to prevent further synergistic liver damage.

chronic_hepatitis_c_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Hepatitis C (Genotype 1a) with Severe Fatigue
  presenting_complaint: Profound, debilitating exhaustion and "brain fog" for 2 years.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female GP presented with non-specific symptoms that had been previously attributed to stress. Screening revealed chronic HCV with a high viral load but no significant fibrosis (F0). Following SVR with an 8-week course of DAAs, her extrahepatic symptoms, specifically the fatigue and cognitive clouding, showed dramatic improvement.

chronic_hepatitis_c_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Hepatitis C in a Patient on Maintenance Haemodialysis
  presenting_complaint: Routine monthly bloods showed a sudden rise in ALT.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male on long-term haemodialysis for end-stage renal disease was diagnosed with Hepatitis C (Genotype 1b). Due to his severe renal impairment (eGFR <15 mL/min), he was treated with the pangenotypic regimen Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir, which is safe in renal failure. He achieved SVR12 without any significant complications or changes to his dialysis schedule.

chronic_hepatitis_c_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Hepatitis C with Refractory Ascites
  presenting_complaint: Frequent need for large-volume paracentesis (every 2 weeks).
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male with HCV-related cirrhosis (Genotype 3) and portal vein thrombosis presented with refractory ascites. Despite achieving SVR with DAAs, his portal hypertension remained severe, requiring the insertion of a Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS). Following TIPS, his ascites became manageable with low-dose diuretics.

chronic_hepatitis_c_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Hepatitis C (Genotype 6) in a Patient from SE Asia
  presenting_complaint: Persistent lethargy and mild dyspepsia.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male originally from Vietnam was screened for viral hepatitis. He was found to have Genotype 6 infection, which is less common in the UK. He had moderate fibrosis (F3, 11.2 kPa) on FibroScan. He was successfully treated with a 12-week course of Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir, demonstrating the efficacy of pangenotypic DAAs against rarer genotypes.
