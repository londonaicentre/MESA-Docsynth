The patient requires ongoing orthopaedic intervention and high-dose Vitamin C supplementation.

ehlers_danlos_syndrome_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hEDS) with comorbid POTS
  presenting_complaint: Postural dizziness, palpitations, and chronic fatigue.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female student reported recurrent syncope and exercise intolerance alongside joint hypermobility. A tilt table test confirmed Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) secondary to hEDS. Treatment included increased fluid/salt intake, compression hosiery, and ivabradine, resulting in moderate symptomatic improvement.

ehlers_danlos_syndrome_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Dermatosparaxis Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (dEDS)
  presenting_complaint: Extreme skin fragility and severe bruising since birth.
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old girl presented with redundant, saggy skin and multiple spontaneous ecchymoses. Clinical suspicion of dEDS was confirmed by identifying biallelic ADAMTS2 mutations. The course is complicated by frequent skin tears requiring surgical closure under local anaesthesia in the paediatric day unit.

ehlers_danlos_syndrome_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Classical-like Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (clEDS)
  presenting_complaint: Generalised joint hypermobility and easy bruising without atrophic scarring.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female presented with chronic musculoskeletal pain and skin laxity. Unlike classical EDS, she lacked the characteristic "cigarette paper" scars; genetic testing revealed a TNXB deficiency (tenascin-X). Management is supportive, focusing on joint stabilisation and monitoring for pelvic organ prolapse.

ehlers_danlos_syndrome_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Arthrochalasia Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (aEDS)
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral congenital hip dislocations at birth.
  summary_of_course: A neonate was born with bilateral hip dislocations and severe generalised hypermobility. Genetic analysis identified a mutation in the COL1A1 gene leading to exon 6 skipping. Despite multiple orthopaedic reductions, the patient maintains significant joint instability requiring lifelong monitoring.

ehlers_danlos_syndrome_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Periodontal Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (pEDS)
  presenting_complaint: Early-onset severe periodontitis and premature tooth loss.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male presented with significant gingival recession and loss of several permanent teeth despite good oral hygiene. Examination noted pretibial hyperpigmented plaques and mild joint hypermobility. Genetic testing confirmed a C1R mutation, and the patient was established on a rigorous dental surveillance programme.

ehlers_danlos_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hEDS)
  presenting_complaint: Severe gastroparesis and intestinal dysmotility.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female with known hEDS presented with intractable vomiting and 15kg weight loss. Gastric emptying studies confirmed severe gastroparesis; initial trials of prokinetics failed. She eventually required a jejunostomy (PEJ) tube for enteral nutrition and remains under the care of a specialist neuro-gastroenterology team.

ehlers_danlos_syndrome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (vEDS)
  presenting_complaint: Acute abdominal pain and rectal haemorrhage.
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old female presented with a spontaneous sigmoid colon perforation. She underwent an emergency Hartmann’s procedure; intraoperatively, her tissues were noted to be exceptionally friable. Post-operative genetic testing confirmed vEDS, and she was counselled regarding the high risks of future pregnancies.

  presenting_complaint: Chronic pelvic pain and bladder dysfunction.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with hEDS reported long-standing interstitial cystitis symptoms and pelvic floor prolapse. Urodynamic studies showed detrusor overactivity and significant pelvic organ descent. Treatment involved a combination of pelvic floor physiotherapy and bladder retraining, though surgical options were deferred due to tissue fragility.

ehlers_danlos_syndrome_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Classical Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (cEDS)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent inguinal hernias and mitral valve prolapse.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old boy with known cEDS (COL5A2 mutation) presented with his third recurrence of an inguinal hernia. Echocardiography also identified mild mitral valve prolapse with trace regurgitation. Surgical repair was performed with non-absorbable sutures and prolonged recovery time to accommodate poor collagen strength.

ehlers_danlos_syndrome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hEDS)
  presenting_complaint: Orthostatic headache and neck pain.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old female with hEDS presented with a "second-half-of-the-day" headache relieved by lying flat. MRI myelogram identified a spontaneous CSF leak at the thoracic level, likely due to dural ectasia or fragility. She underwent two targeted epidural blood patches with successful resolution of symptoms.

ehlers_danlos_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (vEDS)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of pulsatile tinnitus and proptosis.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male presented with symptoms suggestive of a carotid-cavernous sinus fistula. Urgent cerebral angiography confirmed the diagnosis, occurring spontaneously. Given his known COL3A1 mutation, endovascular coiling was performed with extreme caution to avoid arterial dissection, and he was stabilised in the ICU.

ehlers_danlos_syndrome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hEDS)
  presenting_complaint: Failed recovery after multiple orthopaedic surgeries.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male with hEDS underwent three failed labral repairs of the hip, resulting in increased instability and chronic pain. Post-operative reviews suggested poor tissue quality and inadequate healing. He was transitioned to a non-surgical management pathway focused on proprioceptive training and pain psychology.

ehlers_danlos_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Myopathic Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (mEDS)
  presenting_complaint: Congenital muscle weakness and proximal joint contractures.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old girl presented with proximal muscle weakness and distal joint hypermobility. Initial suspicion of muscular dystrophy was ruled out by muscle biopsy, which showed normal dystrophin. Genetic testing eventually identified a COL12A1 mutation, and she now uses a wheelchair for long distances while receiving regular hydrotherapy.
