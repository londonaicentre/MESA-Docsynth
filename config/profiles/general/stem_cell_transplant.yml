  presenting_complaint: Routine follow-up 1-year post-transplant for HbSS.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old male with severe Sickle Cell Disease and prior stroke underwent a busulfan-based allogeneic transplant from a matched sibling. One year post-procedure, he remains transfusion-independent with 100% donor chimerism and no further vaso-occlusive crises. His Haemoglobin S percentage is 0%, and he has successfully discontinued all immunosuppression.

stem_cell_transplant_008:
  primary_diagnosis: CMV reactivation post-allogeneic transplant
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic rise in CMV viral load on routine screening.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female with ALL underwent a MUD transplant (D-/R+). Routine PCR monitoring on Day +45 detected CMV DNA at 55,000 IU/mL despite no clinical symptoms of organ disease. She was treated with pre-emptive Valganciclovir as an outpatient, which successfully cleared the viraemia within three weeks, though she required G-CSF support for associated neutropenia.

stem_cell_transplant_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe neutropenic sepsis post-autologous transplant
  presenting_complaint: Rigors, hypotension (BP 85/50), and fever (39.5°C) Day +6.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with Multiple Myeloma became febrile during the pre-engraftment phase of his autologous transplant. He rapidly deteriorated into septic shock requiring fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support in the High Dependency Unit. Blood cultures grew Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL producing), and he was successfully treated with Meropenem and Amikacin, eventually engrafting on Day +13.

stem_cell_transplant_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease (cGvHD)
  presenting_complaint: Gritty eyes, dry mouth, and sclerodermatous skin changes.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female, 9 months post-RIC transplant for Follicular Lymphoma, presented with multi-organ chronic GvHD. Clinical examination revealed lichenoid oral lesions, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, and tightening of the skin over her forearms limiting joint mobility. She was commenced on a combination of Ciclosporin and extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) to manage the progressive fibrotic changes.

stem_cell_transplant_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis (IPA) post-transplant
  presenting_complaint: Pleuritic chest pain and haemoptysis during prolonged neutropenia.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male with AML (high-risk) underwent allogeneic transplant and experienced delayed engraftment. On Day +18, he developed new respiratory symptoms; CT thorax demonstrated a "halo sign" in the right upper lobe, and serum galactomannan was positive (index 2.4). He was treated with intravenous Voriconazole for 6 weeks, followed by oral step-down, with eventual radiological resolution.

stem_cell_transplant_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Umbilical cord blood transplant for paediatric ALL
  presenting_complaint: Delayed platelet engraftment and epistaxis.
  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old female with relapsed ALL received a 5/6 HLA-matched umbilical cord blood transplant. While neutrophil recovery occurred on Day +24, she remained platelet-transfusion dependent until Day +52. She was managed with prophylactic tranexamic acid and careful platelet support, eventually achieving stable counts and full donor chimerism by Day +100.

stem_cell_transplant_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Early relapse of DLBCL post-autologous transplant
  presenting_complaint: New palpable cervical lymphadenopathy 3 months post-transplant.
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old male with Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) underwent autologous transplant after achieving a partial response to salvage chemotherapy. Routine PET-CT at Day +100 showed intensive FDG-uptake in the neck and mediastinum, confirmed as relapsed DLBCL by core biopsy. This represented an early treatment failure, and he was subsequently referred for CAR-T cell therapy evaluation.

stem_cell_transplant_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary graft failure post-allogeneic transplant
  presenting_complaint: Sudden drop in blood counts after initial full engraftment.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with Myelofibrosis initially engrafted well by Day +15 post-allogeneic transplant. However, on Day +70, his counts plummeted (Hb 72, Plt 12, Neut 0.2) following a severe viral infection (Parvovirus B19). Bone marrow aspirate showed pure red cell aplasia and hypocellularity, and despite IVIG treatment, his counts failed to recover, necessitating a CD34+ selected stem cell boost.

stem_cell_transplant_015:
  primary_diagnosis: BK virus-associated haemorrhagic cystitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe dysuria and macroscopic haematuria with clots.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female, Day +35 post-allogeneic transplant for AML, presented with excruciating suprapubic pain and frank haematuria. Urine PCR was strongly positive for BK virus (>10^9 copies/mL). Management included aggressive hyperhydration, bladder irrigation, and reduction of immunosuppression, with gradual resolution of symptoms over 14 days.

stem_cell_transplant_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Allogeneic transplant for Beta-Thalassemia Major
  presenting_complaint: Admission for elective transplant from matched sibling.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old male with transfusion-dependent thalassemia underwent a busulfan/cyclophosphamide-conditioned transplant. His course was complicated by pre-existing iron overload (Ferritin 4500 ng/mL), requiring careful management of veno-occlusive disease risk with prophylactic Defibrotide. He successfully engrafted on Day +14 and began a post-transplant iron chelation programme once stable.

stem_cell_transplant_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Cardiac toxicity post-autologous transplant
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations and light-headedness Day +2 post-conditioning.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male with Mantle Cell Lymphoma received high-dose BEAM conditioning. Shortly after stem cell infusion, he developed new-onset Atrial Fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response (150 bpm). He was treated with intravenous amiodarone and required temporary anticoagulation, with a return to sinus rhythm within 48 hours and no long-term cardiac sequelae.

  primary_diagnosis: EBV-related PTLD post-allogeneic transplant
  presenting_complaint: Fever, night sweats, and tonsillar enlargement Day +120.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male underwent a T-cell depleted allogeneic transplant for AML. Four months later, he presented with lymphadenopathy and a rapidly rising EBV viral load (PCR 250,000 IU/mL). Biopsy of a cervical node confirmed Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder (PTLD), and he was successfully treated with four weekly doses of Rituximab and reduction of ciclosporin.

stem_cell_transplant_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic renal failure post-transplant
  presenting_complaint: Oliguria and rising creatinine (340 µmol/L) Day +40.
  summary_of_course: A 71-year-old female with MDS underwent RIC-allogeneic transplant with a baseline creatinine of 110 µmol/L. Following the introduction of Ciclosporin and a course of Amphotericin B for suspected fungal infection, her renal function deteriorated sharply. She required temporary haemodialysis and a switch from Ciclosporin to Sirolimus, with partial recovery of renal function to near-baseline over several weeks.

stem_cell_transplant_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Hyperacute GvHD following Donor Lymphocyte Infusion (DLI)
  presenting_complaint: Erythroderma and jaundice 7 days post-DLI.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male with AML post-allogeneic transplant received a DLI for falling donor chimerism (dropped to 60%). One week later, he developed a life-threatening hyperacute GvHD with universal skin exfoliation and liver failure (Bilirubin 450 µmol/L). Despite intensive immunosuppression with steroids and Etanercept, he developed multi-organ failure and was transitioned to palliative care.
