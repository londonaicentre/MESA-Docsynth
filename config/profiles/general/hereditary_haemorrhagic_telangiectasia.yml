  primary_diagnosis: Brain Abscess complicating HHT
  presenting_complaint: Severe headache, fever, and confusion
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old male presented with a 5-day history of worsening headache and pyrexia. MRI showed a ring-enhancing lesion in the left parietal lobe, and cultures grew Streptococcus intermedius. Screening for a source of infection revealed previously undiagnosed PAVMs, leading to a new diagnosis of HHT. He completed a 6-week course of IV antibiotics and later underwent PAVM embolisation.

hereditary_haemorrhagic_telangiectasia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Epistaxis
  presenting_complaint: Severe, intractable nosebleeds
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with HHT2 (ACVRL1 mutation) presented with epistaxis lasting over 2 hours despite self-packing. He had failed multiple previous laser treatments and septodermoplasty. Due to the severity of the bleeding and a baseline Hb of 78g/L, he underwent a Young’s procedure (total endonasal closure). This resulted in complete cessation of epistaxis and significant improvement in quality of life.

hereditary_haemorrhagic_telangiectasia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Juvenile Polyposis and HHT Overlap
  presenting_complaint: Rectal bleeding and abdominal pain
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with a family history of SMAD4 mutation presented for screening. Colonoscopy identified over 50 hamartomatous polyps, while clinical exam showed characteristic HHT telangiectasias on the buccal mucosa. He was diagnosed with Juvenile Polyposis-HHT overlap syndrome. He underwent a subtotal colectomy due to the high polyp burden and risk of malignancy.

hereditary_haemorrhagic_telangiectasia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic Anaemia exacerbated by NSAIDs
  presenting_complaint: Severe lethargy and palpitations
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female with HHT and osteoarthritis presented with a drop in Hb from 110g/L to 62g/L. She had recently started Ibuprofen for joint pain, which exacerbated bleeding from pre-existing GI telangiectasias. She required a 4-unit red cell transfusion and was counselled to strictly avoid NSAIDs. Her anaemia was subsequently managed with regular iron infusions and tranexamic acid.
