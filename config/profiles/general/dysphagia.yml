dysphagia_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute post-stroke dysphagia
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset coughing and choking when attempting to drink water following right-sided weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male presented with an acute ischaemic stroke affecting the left MCA territory. Bedside swallow screening was failed due to immediate coughing; SALT assessment confirmed oropharyngeal dysphagia with high aspiration risk. He was managed with NBM status, nasogastric feeding, and subsequent transition to Level 2 thickened fluids.

dysphagia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Oesophageal adenocarcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Progressive three-month history of solid food sticking in the mid-chest, now progressed to liquids.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female with a 20-year history of GORD and 10kg weight loss underwent urgent OGD. Endoscopy revealed a friable, obstructing mass in the distal third of the oesophagus, confirmed as adenocarcinoma on biopsy. She was referred to the MDT for staging CT and consideration of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.

dysphagia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Achalasia
  presenting_complaint: Long-standing intermittent dysphagia to both solids and liquids, accompanied by nocturnal regurgitation.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male reported a two-year history of "food getting stuck" and retrosternal discomfort. Barium swallow showed a "bird's beak" appearance and manometry confirmed aperistalsis with failed LES relaxation. He underwent a successful laparoscopic Heller myotomy with partial fundoplication.

dysphagia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE)
  presenting_complaint: Acute food bolus obstruction after eating a piece of steak.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with a history of asthma and hay fever presented to A&E unable to swallow saliva. Urgent OGD removed the impacted meat and showed linear furrowing and trachealisation of the oesophagus. Biopsies revealed >20 eosinophils per high-power field, and he was started on swallowed fluticasone and an elimination diet.

dysphagia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Neurogenic dysphagia secondary to Parkinson's disease
  presenting_complaint: Slow eating, multiple swallows per bolus, and frequent drooling.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with advanced Parkinson's disease reported increasing difficulty managing saliva and dry crackers. Videofluoroscopy (VFS) demonstrated delayed swallow initiation and significant vallecular pooling. His medication timing was optimised, and he was placed on a soft, moist diet (IDDSI Level 6).

dysphagia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Oesophageal foreign body
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of crying, drooling, and refusal to eat in a toddler.
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old girl was brought to the paediatric emergency department after she was seen playing with coins and suddenly became distressed. Chest X-ray confirmed a circular radio-opaque foreign body at the level of the cricopharyngeus. It was successfully removed via rigid oesophagoscopy under general anaesthesia without mucosal injury.

dysphagia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Zenker's diverticulum (Pharyngeal pouch)
  presenting_complaint: Regurgitation of undigested food several hours after eating and persistent halitosis.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male presented with chronic cough and a sensation of a lump in the neck. Barium swallow identified a large posterior midline diverticulum arising above the cricopharyngeus muscle. He underwent an endoscopic stapling of the pouch, resulting in complete resolution of his symptoms.

dysphagia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Benign peptic stricture
  presenting_complaint: Gradual onset of solid food dysphagia over six months, primarily localised to the epigastrium.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with poorly controlled chronic heartburn reported bread and meat getting stuck. OGD identified a 10mm smooth circumferential narrowing in the distal oesophagus secondary to chronic acid reflux. The stricture was treated with balloon dilatation and the patient was commenced on high-dose twice-daily PPI therapy.

dysphagia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Myasthenia gravis
  presenting_complaint: Fatigable swallowing difficulty that worsens towards the end of a meal.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female presented with intermittent double vision and difficulty chewing and swallowing. Symptoms were noted to be absent in the morning but severe by dinner time. Positive acetylcholine receptor antibodies and a decremental response on repetitive nerve stimulation confirmed the diagnosis; she responded well to pyridostigmine.

dysphagia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Radiation-induced oesophageal fibrosis
  presenting_complaint: Severe, persistent dysphagia to all textures following oncological treatment.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male, two years post-radiotherapy for laryngeal carcinoma, developed progressive narrowing of the upper oesophagus. OGD showed pale, scarred, non-compliant mucosa with a narrow lumen. Despite multiple attempts at dilatation, he remained dependent on a PEG tube for primary nutrition and hydration.

dysphagia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Globus pharyngeus
  presenting_complaint: Persistent sensation of a "lump in the throat" that is not associated with actual difficulty swallowing food.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female reported a constant tightness in her throat, which improved during meals but worsened when stressed. Clinical examination, ENT nasendoscopy, and a barium swallow were all unremarkable. She was reassured of the benign nature of the condition and managed with speech therapy techniques and stress reduction.

dysphagia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Candidal oesophagitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe odynophagia and retrosternal pain when swallowing, even with liquids.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with newly diagnosed HIV and a low CD4 count presented with oral thrush and painful swallowing. OGD revealed extensive white plaques and ulceration throughout the oesophageal mucosa. He was treated with a 14-day course of oral fluconazole, leading to a rapid improvement in swallowing function.

dysphagia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Bulbar-onset Motor Neurone Disease
  presenting_complaint: Slurred speech and frequent choking on thin liquids.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female presented with a three-month history of dysarthria and progressive difficulty swallowing water. Neurological examination showed tongue fasciculations and a weak cough. Following a diagnosis of MND, she was proactively fitted with a RIG (Radiologically Inserted Gastrostomy) to maintain nutrition as her bulbar function declined.

dysphagia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Systemic sclerosis-associated dysmotility
  presenting_complaint: Chronic retrosternal heaviness after meals and severe acid regurgitation.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with Raynaud's phenomenon and sclerodactyly reported that food "sat" in her chest for hours. Oesophageal manometry showed absent peristalsis in the distal two-thirds of the oesophagus and a hypotensive LES. Management focused on aggressive reflux control and prokinetic agents to assist gastric emptying.

dysphagia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Plummer-Vinson syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty swallowing solids and extreme lethargy.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female presented with koilonychia, glossitis, and a microcytic anaemia (Hb 82g/L). Barium swallow demonstrated a thin, horizontal shelf-like projection in the post-cricoid region. The oesophageal web was ruptured during OGD, and her symptoms resolved following intravenous iron replacement therapy.

dysphagia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Diffuse oesophageal spasm
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent, severe retrosternal chest pain triggered by cold liquids, associated with transient dysphagia.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male presented with episodes of chest pain that mimicked angina but were unrelated to exertion. Cardiac workup was negative; barium swallow during an episode showed a "corkscrew" oesophagus. He was successfully managed with calcium channel blockers and nitrates to relax the oesophageal smooth muscle.

dysphagia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Dermatomyositis-associated dysphagia
  presenting_complaint: Inability to initiate a swallow and weakness in the shoulders and hips.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female presented with a heliotrope rash and proximal muscle weakness. She reported significant difficulty transferring food from the mouth to the pharynx. Elevated CK levels and muscle biopsy confirmed dermatomyositis; swallowing improved significantly following high-dose corticosteroid therapy and IVIG.

dysphagia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Large para-oesophageal hiatus hernia
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent post-prandial fullness, chest pressure, and occasional vomiting of undigested food.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female presented with recurrent episodes of "blockage" in the lower chest. A CT scan revealed a large type II hiatus hernia with the gastric fundus herniating into the thoracic cavity, causing extrinsic compression of the distal oesophagus. She underwent successful laparoscopic hernia repair and gastropexy.

dysphagia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic neurogenic dysphagia (Cerebral Palsy)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent chest infections and poor weight gain in a paediatric patient.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy with spastic quadriplegic CP (GMFCS V) had a history of "wet" voice and coughing during feeds. Videofluoroscopy confirmed silent aspiration of thin and nectar-thickened liquids. Due to the high risk of pneumonia and failure to thrive, he was transitioned to total enteral feeding via a gastrostomy button.

dysphagia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Caustic oesophageal stricture
  presenting_complaint: Acute throat pain and inability to swallow following accidental ingestion of a concentrated cleaning agent.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male presented with oral burns and stridor after ingesting bleach. Following initial ICU stabilisation for airway oedema, serial OGDs showed extensive circumferential ulceration leading to a long, complex stricture. He required multiple sessions of endoscopic dilatation and eventually an oesophageal replacement (colonic interposition).
