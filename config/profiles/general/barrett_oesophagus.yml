He remained stable post-procedure and was discharged on oral PPIs with follow-up endoscopy in 8 weeks.

barrett_oesophagus_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Barrett's oesophagus-associated adenocarcinoma (T1a)
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss and mild iron deficiency anaemia
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female smoker underwent OGD for unexplained weight loss and a haemoglobin of 105g/L. A nodular area was identified within a 4cm Barrett's segment, and EMR confirmed intramucosal adenocarcinoma (T1a). Staging CT and EUS showed no lymphadenopathy, and she was managed endoscopically with curative intent.

barrett_oesophagus_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Short-segment Barrett's oesophagus, indefinite for dysplasia
  presenting_complaint: Epigastric pain and nocturnal reflux
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female underwent endoscopy showing a 1.5cm segment of Barrett's. Initial biopsy results were reported as "indefinite for dysplasia" due to significant active inflammation. Following 3 months of intensive acid suppression, repeat biopsies were clear of dysplasia, and she returned to standard surveillance.

barrett_oesophagus_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Barrett's oesophagus in Systemic Sclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Severe dysphagia and refractory reflux
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female with known scleroderma presented with severe retrosternal pain. OGD showed extensive Barrett's metaplasia and severe oesophagitis despite standard PPI dosing. Manometry confirmed oesophageal aperistalsis, and her management was escalated to include prokinetics and high-dose vonoprazan.

barrett_oesophagus_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Low-grade dysplasia in Barrett's oesophagus
  presenting_complaint: Routine surveillance of known Barrett's
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male with a 5cm Barrett's segment had surveillance biopsies showing low-grade dysplasia (LGD), confirmed by two independent gastrointestinal pathologists. In accordance with BSG guidelines, he was offered the choice of 6-monthly surveillance or RFA. He opted for RFA to reduce the risk of progression to adenocarcinoma.

barrett_oesophagus_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic Barrett's oesophagus
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding during investigation for dyspepsia
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male underwent OGD for persistent bloating and epigastric discomfort. While the stomach was normal, a 3cm segment of Barrett's (C1M3) was noted at the distal oesophagus. Biopsies confirmed intestinal metaplasia, and he was counselled on lifestyle modifications and the need for periodic endoscopic monitoring.

barrett_oesophagus_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Barrett's oesophagus with meat bolus obstruction
  presenting_complaint: Acute inability to swallow saliva after eating steak
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented to A&E with acute food bolus impaction. The bolus was endoscopically pushed into the stomach, revealing underlying Barrett's metaplasia and a subtle Schatzki ring. Subsequent biopsies confirmed Barrett's without dysplasia, and he was advised on thorough mastication and PPI therapy.

barrett_oesophagus_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Barrett's oesophagus post-Heller's Myotomy
  presenting_complaint: Chronic cough and hoarseness
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with a history of achalasia treated with Heller's myotomy 15 years prior presented with respiratory symptoms. ENT evaluation suggested LPR, and OGD confirmed the development of a 4cm Barrett's segment due to chronic post-surgical reflux. He was started on aggressive acid suppression to manage the metaplastic progression.

barrett_oesophagus_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Barrett's oesophagus in a paediatric patient
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent vomiting and poor weight gain
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old male with severe childhood obesity and chronic GORD underwent OGD due to persistent symptoms despite PPIs. Endoscopy revealed a 2cm segment of columnar epithelium, which biopsies confirmed as Barrett's oesophagus. He was referred to a specialist adolescent GI clinic for long-term management and weight transition support.

barrett_oesophagus_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Barrett's oesophagus post-RFA
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent heartburn following endoscopic ablation
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male who previously underwent RFA for HGD presented for follow-up. Surveillance OGD showed "buried Barrett's" (metaplasia underneath neosquamous epithelium) in the distal oesophagus. He required further focal RFA and an increase in his PPI regimen to achieve complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia.

barrett_oesophagus_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Barrett's oesophagus with large hiatus hernia
  presenting_complaint: Post-prandial fullness and regurgitation
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female was found to have a 6cm sliding hiatus hernia and a 5cm segment of Barrett's (C3M5). Due to the size of the hernia and the severity of her reflux, she was considered for laparoscopic fundoplication. Pre-operative biopsies showed no dysplasia, and the surgery successfully controlled her symptoms.

barrett_oesophagus_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Barrett's oesophagus in an elderly patient with multiple comorbidities
  presenting_complaint: Iron deficiency anaemia (Hb 92g/L)
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old male with dementia, AF, and CKD underwent a diagnostic OGD for anaemia. A 3cm Barrett's segment was identified, but given his significant frailty and limited life expectancy, a multidisciplinary team decision was made to omit regular endoscopic surveillance and focus on symptomatic control.

barrett_oesophagus_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Barrett's oesophagus with atypical chest pain
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of non-cardiac chest pain
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female underwent extensive cardiac workup which was negative before being referred for OGD. Endoscopy showed a 2cm Barrett's segment (C0M2) and biopsies showed no dysplasia. Her chest pain improved significantly with high-dose PPI therapy, confirming a reflux-related origin.

barrett_oesophagus_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Long-segment Barrett's oesophagus (C12M14)
  presenting_complaint: Minimal symptoms despite extensive metaplasia
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male with a history of heavy alcohol use and smoking underwent OGD for mild dyspepsia. An exceptionally long segment of Barrett's was found, extending nearly to the mid-oesophagus. Despite the length, biopsies showed no dysplasia, but he was classified as high-risk for progression due to the segment length and smoking history.

barrett_oesophagus_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Barrett's oesophagus with nodular dysplasia
  presenting_complaint: Routine surveillance of known Barrett's
  summary_of_course: A 57-year-old male with a 4cm Barrett's segment was found to have a 5mm nodule during surveillance using narrow-band imaging (NBI). The nodule was removed via EMR, and pathology showed HGD with clear margins. He subsequently underwent RFA to the remaining Barrett's segment to prevent recurrence.

barrett_oesophagus_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Barrett's oesophagus with severe erosive oesophagitis
  presenting_complaint: Odynophagia and severe retrosternal pain
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male presented with acute-on-chronic reflux symptoms. OGD showed Los Angeles Grade D oesophagitis overlying a previously undocumented Barrett's segment. He was treated with an 8-week course of 40mg twice-daily esomeprazole, and repeat OGD confirmed healing of the erosions, allowing for accurate Barrett's measurement and biopsy.

barrett_oesophagus_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Barrett's oesophagus with failed surveillance
  presenting_complaint: New-onset dysphagia to solids
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male who had missed two surveillance appointments over five years presented with progressive dysphagia. OGD revealed a large, friable mass within a known Barrett's segment. Biopsies confirmed invasive adenocarcinoma (T3N1), and he was referred for neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by potential oesophagectomy.
