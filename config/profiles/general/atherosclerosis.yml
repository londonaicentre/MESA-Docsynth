He underwent urgent femoropopliteal bypass surgery to salvage the limb from impending gangrene.

atherosclerosis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Premature atherosclerosis due to Familial Hypercholesterolaemia
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic presence of tendon xanthomas
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old male was referred to paediatrics after his father suffered a premature MI at age 36. Clinical examination revealed Achilles tendon xanthomas, and fasting lipids showed an LDL-cholesterol of 9.2 mmol/L. Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) scanning confirmed early atherosclerotic plaque formation, necessitating high-intensity statin therapy and dietary modification.

atherosclerosis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Carotid artery stenosis with TIA
  presenting_complaint: Transient loss of vision in the left eye (amaurosis fugax)
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old female experienced a 5-minute episode of "a curtain falling" over her left eye. Carotid duplex ultrasonography revealed 85% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery due to an unstable atherosclerotic plaque. She was admitted for an urgent carotid endarterectomy to prevent a major ischaemic stroke.

atherosclerosis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic mesenteric ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Post-prandial abdominal pain and significant weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male presented with "food fear" due to severe epigastric pain occurring 30 minutes after eating. CT angiography demonstrated significant atherosclerotic narrowing of the celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery. He underwent endovascular stenting of the SMA, resulting in the resolution of pain and gradual weight gain.

atherosclerosis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic Abdominal Aortic Artery (AAA)
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding on routine screening
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male attended the national AAA screening programme, where an ultrasound identified a 4.8 cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm. The aneurysm was attributed to long-standing atherosclerosis and hypertension. He was entered into a 6-monthly surveillance programme and started on 80mg atorvastatin to stabilise the plaque and reduce cardiovascular risk.

atherosclerosis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Renal artery stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Resistant hypertension and declining renal function
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female with known systemic atherosclerosis presented with a blood pressure of 195/110 mmHg despite taking four antihypertensive agents. MR angiography confirmed 80% narrowing of the right renal artery. Following renal artery angioplasty, her blood pressure became manageable on two medications, and her serum creatinine stabilised.

atherosclerosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic limb ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of cold, pale, and pulseless left leg
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with a history of intermittent claudication presented with acute leg pain. Investigation revealed an acute thrombosis over a pre-existing atherosclerotic lesion in the popliteal artery. He was treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis and subsequent balloon angioplasty, successfully restoring distal perfusion.

atherosclerosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Subclinical atherosclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Request for cardiovascular risk assessment
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old asymptomatic male underwent a private health check including a CT coronary calcium score. The score was 450, indicating a high burden of coronary atherosclerosis despite a normal resting ECG. He was classified as high-risk and initiated on primary prevention therapy with aspirin and lipid-lowering agents.

atherosclerosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Ischaemic cardiomyopathy with HFpEF
  presenting_complaint: Progressive orthopnoea and peripheral oedema
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with a history of multi-vessel coronary disease presented with signs of congestive heart failure. Echocardiography showed a preserved ejection fraction but significant diastolic dysfunction and regional wall motion abnormalities. Her condition was managed with diuretics and optimisation of her anti-ischaemic regimen to treat the underlying atherosclerosis.

atherosclerosis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Atypical angina (Diagnostic Challenge)
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent epigastric discomfort and nausea
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with no traditional risk factors presented with symptoms initially misdiagnosed as GORD. Due to persistence, a CT coronary angiogram was performed, revealing an isolated, high-risk soft plaque in the proximal circumflex artery. She was successfully managed with aggressive lifestyle changes and pharmacotherapy, avoiding an invasive procedure.

atherosclerosis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset severe back pain and hypotension
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old male collapsed at home with acute peritonism and signs of haemorrhagic shock. Emergency CT showed a ruptured 7cm AAA with retroperitoneal haemorrhage secondary to advanced atherosclerotic wall degradation. He underwent an emergency endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) in the vascular theatre and was transferred to ICU post-operatively.

atherosclerosis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Intermittent claudication
  presenting_complaint: Cramping calf pain after walking 50 metres
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old heavy smoker presented with bilateral calf pain that forced him to stop while walking. Ankle-brachial pressure indices were 0.65 on the left and 0.70 on the right. He was enrolled in a supervised exercise programme and referred to smoking cessation services, showing a 200-metre improvement in walking distance over 3 months.

atherosclerosis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Silent myocardial ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Routine pre-operative ECG abnormalities
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old female with long-standing type 2 diabetes was scheduled for elective hip replacement. A routine ECG showed deep T-wave inversions in the lateral leads, and subsequent myocardial perfusion imaging revealed significant reversible ischaemia. Despite being asymptomatic, her surgery was postponed for coronary optimisation of her silent atherosclerosis.

atherosclerosis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Atherosclerotic renovascular hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Flash pulmonary oedema
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old male with known peripheral vascular disease presented with sudden-onset respiratory distress. Clinical examination and imaging confirmed bilateral renal artery stenosis (Pickering Syndrome) leading to fluid overload. He required emergency stabilisation with CPAP and nitrates, followed by bilateral renal artery stenting.

atherosclerosis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset dysphasia and right-sided facial droop
  summary_of_course: An 81-year-old female with no atrial fibrillation presented with an acute ischaemic stroke. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) identified "shaggy" atherosclerotic plaques (>4mm thickness) in the aortic arch as the likely embolic source. She was started on dual antiplatelet therapy and high-dose statins for secondary prevention.

atherosclerosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Vasculogenic erectile dysfunction
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty maintaining erections for 12 months
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male presented to his GP with erectile dysfunction unresponsive to PDE5 inhibitors. Further investigation revealed a high Framingham risk score and evidence of systemic atherosclerosis on penile Doppler. This served as a sentinel marker for occult coronary artery disease, leading to early cardiovascular intervention.

atherosclerosis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Blue toe syndrome (Atheroembolism)
  presenting_complaint: Painful, blue discolouration of the second and third toes
  summary_of_course: A 73-year-old male presented with "trash foot" following a recent cardiac catheterisation. Small cholesterol crystals had embolised from an ulcerated atherosclerotic plaque in the aorta to the digital arteries. Treatment was supportive with analgesia and antiplatelets, focusing on preventing further embolic events from the proximal source.

atherosclerosis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Metabolic syndrome with carotid thickening
  presenting_complaint: Generalised fatigue and obesity
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old female with a BMI of 34, pre-diabetes, and hypertriglyceridaemia was screened for cardiovascular risk. Ultrasound showed increased carotid intima-media thickness (1.1mm) and small non-obstructive plaques at the bifurcation. She was started on Metformin and Orlistat, with a focus on aggressive risk factor modification to halt the progression of atherosclerosis.
