  primary_diagnosis: Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder with Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent idiopathic anaphylaxis and chronic joint pain.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female with systemic hypermobility presented with episodic flushing, abdominal cramping, and urticaria triggered by various foods. Investigations showed elevated serum tryptase during episodes and clinical response to H1/H2 receptor antagonists. This complex case required a multidisciplinary approach involving immunology and rheumatology.

hypermobility_syndrome_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Craniocervical Instability (CCI) secondary to hEDS
  presenting_complaint: Severe occipital headache and neurological "electric shock" sensations.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male with a history of hEDS developed progressive myelopathic symptoms and worsening headaches when upright. Upright MRI revealed significant ligamentous laxity at the craniovertebral junction. He underwent a posterior occipitocervical fusion (C0-C2) to stabilise the joint, resulting in significant symptom resolution.

  primary_diagnosis: Secondary Osteoarthritis in Hypermobility Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Progressive bilateral hip pain and stiffness.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old retired gymnast with a lifelong history of hypermobility presented with reduced range of motion in both hips. Radiographs showed Grade 3 Kellgren-Lawrence osteoarthritis, likely accelerated by chronic joint instability. Despite her hypermobility, she underwent successful bilateral total hip arthroplasties with specific intraoperative considerations for soft tissue laxity.

hypermobility_syndrome_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Marfan Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of a heart murmur and tall stature.
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old male was referred following a school sports physical due to arachnodactyly and a pectus excavatum deformity. Echocardiography revealed an aortic root diameter of 4.2cm (Z-score >2). He was started on losartan for aortic protection and advised to avoid high-intensity contact sports.

hypermobility_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Pelvic Organ Prolapse in a Nulliparous Hypermobile Patient
  presenting_complaint: Pelvic heaviness and "something coming down."
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old nulliparous female with hEDS presented to urogynaecology with symptomatic Stage II uterine prolapse. The premature pelvic floor failure was attributed to systemic collagen deficiency. She was managed conservatively with pelvic floor physiotherapy and a ring pessary, avoiding early surgical intervention.

hypermobility_syndrome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Traumatic Shoulder Dislocation in HSD
  presenting_complaint: Acute deformity and severe pain in the right shoulder.
  summary_of_course: A 20-year-old male with known joint hypermobility sustained a low-energy anterior shoulder dislocation while reaching for a shelf. Following closed reduction in A&E, he was referred for intensive stabilisation physiotherapy. Due to recurrent instability (three episodes in six months), he eventually required a Latarjet procedure to address glenohumeral laxity.

hypermobility_syndrome_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Spontaneous Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Leak
  presenting_complaint: Severe orthostatic headache and tinnitus.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female with hEDS presented with a "thunderclap" headache that improved immediately upon lying flat. An MRI brain showed pachymeningeal enhancement and sagging of the brainstem. She was diagnosed with a spontaneous spinal CSF leak due to dural fragility and was successfully treated with an autologous epidural blood patch.

hypermobility_syndrome_014:

  presenting_complaint: Jaw clicking, locking, and facial pain.
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old dental hygienist with G-HSD reported worsening TMJ pain and episodes where her jaw "stuck" open. Examination showed excessive mandibular excursion and tenderness in the muscles of mastication. She was treated with a stabilisation splint, soft diet advice, and specific intra-oral physiotherapy.

hypermobility_syndrome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Failed Multiple Ligamentous Reconstructions
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent knee instability despite two previous ACL repairs.
  summary_of_course: A 23-year-old female athlete with undiagnosed hypermobility suffered repeated failures of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) grafts. Subsequent assessment revealed systemic laxity (Beighton 9/9) and poor tissue quality. Her third reconstruction used a thicker allograft with extra-articular tenodesis, combined with a hypermobility-specific rehabilitation protocol.

hypermobility_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Localised Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder (L-HSD)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic right ankle instability and frequent sprains.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male presented with persistent ankle pain. While his systemic Beighton score was low (2/9), his right ankle demonstrated significant mechanical and functional laxity following an old injury. He was diagnosed with L-HSD and managed with peroneal strengthening and proprioceptive training.
