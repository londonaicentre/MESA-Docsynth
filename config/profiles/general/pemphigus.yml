pemphigus_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Pemphigus vulgaris
  presenting_complaint: Persistent painful oral ulceration and dysphagia
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old woman presented with a 3-month history of refractory mouth ulcers initially treated as aphthous stomatitis. Clinical examination revealed extensive erosions on the buccal mucosa and soft palate, with subsequent development of flaccid bullae on the torso. Skin biopsy confirmed suprabasal acantholysis and DIF showed "fish-net" IgG deposition, leading to a diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris managed with high-dose prednisolone and rituximab.

pemphigus_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Pemphigus foliaceus
  presenting_complaint: Scaly, crusting skin lesions on the face and upper trunk
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old man presented with an "exfoliative" rash in a seborrhoeic distribution, notably sparing the mucous membranes. Histopathology demonstrated subcorneal blistering and anti-desmoglein 1 antibodies were significantly elevated at 150 U/mL (normal <20). He was commenced on topical potent steroids and oral dapsone, showing a good clinical response over six weeks.

pemphigus_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Paraneoplastic pemphigus
  presenting_complaint: Severe haemorrhagic crusting of lips and painful conjunctivitis
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with known follicular lymphoma developed explosive mucocutaneous erosions and lichenoid eruptions on the palms. Investigations revealed anti-plakin antibodies and multi-organ involvement including bronchiolitis obliterans. Despite aggressive immunosuppression with ciclosporin and IVIg, the patient’s respiratory function declined, necessitating palliative involvement.

pemphigus_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Drug-induced pemphigus vulgaris
  presenting_complaint: Widespread blistering following initiation of penicillamine
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis developed flaccid blisters on her neck and axillae four months after starting penicillamine. Histology confirmed pemphigus vulgaris features, but the condition resolved completely within eight weeks of drug cessation and a short course of oral prednisolone.

pemphigus_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Pemphigus vegetans
  presenting_complaint: Vegetating, cauliflower-like plaques in the groins
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old man presented with hypertrophic, foul-smelling lesions in the intertriginous areas and oral erosions. Initial suspicion of fungal infection was ruled out; biopsy showed suprabasal acantholysis with significant eosinophilic microabscesses. He was diagnosed with the Neumann subtype of pemphigus vegetans and responded to oral prednisolone and azathioprine.

pemphigus_006:
  primary_diagnosis: IgA pemphigus (Subcorneal Pustular Dermatosis type)
  presenting_complaint: Pruritic vesicopustular eruption in a circinate pattern
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old woman presented with "half-and-half" blisters (pustules with fluid levels) on her trunk. DIF revealed intercellular IgA deposits in the upper epidermis, and ELISA was positive for anti-desmocollin 1. She achieved rapid clearance with dapsone 100mg daily.

pemphigus_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe pemphigus vulgaris with secondary sepsis
  presenting_complaint: Widespread skin denudation, fever, and rigors
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old frail male with known PV suffered a major flare involving 40% body surface area. He was admitted to the burns unit for specialised dressings and fluid resuscitation but developed Staphylococcus aureus septicaemia from infected erosions. He was treated with IV flucloxacillin and increased immunosuppression, requiring a prolonged hospital stay.

pemphigus_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric pemphigus vulgaris
  presenting_complaint: Chronic oral erosions and scalp crusting
  summary_of_course: A 9-year-old girl presented with painful mouth ulcers that interfered with nutrition. Diagnosis was delayed by 6 months until Nikolsky sign was noted as positive during a dental check-up. She was successfully managed with a steroid-sparing regimen of mycophenolate mofetil to minimise growth retardation risks associated with long-term corticosteroids.

pemphigus_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Pemphigus erythematosus (Senear-Usher syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Malar rash and blistering on the upper back
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old woman presented with features overlapping pemphigus foliaceus and systemic lupus erythematosus. Serology showed positive ANA (1:320) and anti-dsDNA, while skin biopsy confirmed acantholysis and granular basement membrane zone deposits. She was managed with hydroxychloroquine and low-dose prednisolone.

pemphigus_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory pemphigus vulgaris
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent blistering despite rituximab and mycophenolate
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old man with a 5-year history of PV failed to maintain remission despite two cycles of rituximab and maximal doses of mycophenolate mofetil. He was transitioned to monthly IVIg infusions (2g/kg), which finally stabilised the disease and allowed for the tapering of oral steroids to 5mg daily.

pemphigus_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Pemphigus vulgaris in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: New onset blisters on the abdomen during the second trimester
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant woman developed PV confirmed by biopsy and high anti-Dsg3 titres. Management was complicated by the need to avoid certain immunosuppressants; she was maintained on prednisolone and topical steroids. The neonate showed transient blistering at birth due to placental transfer of maternal IgG, which resolved spontaneously within three weeks.

pemphigus_012:
  primary_diagnosis: IgA pemphigus (Intraepidermal Neutrophilic type)
  presenting_complaint: Itchy, erythematous plaques with peripheral pustules
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old man presented with an atypical eruption on the limbs and trunk. Histology showed neutrophilic infiltration throughout the epidermis and DIF confirmed IgA intercellular staining. Unlike the SPD type, this IEN subtype was associated with anti-desmoglein 3 IgA antibodies and required combined dapsone and ciclosporin for control.

pemphigus_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Pemphigus vulgaris with oesophageal involvement
  presenting_complaint: Severe odynophagia and haematemesis
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old woman with established PV presented with worsening chest pain and vomiting blood. Endoscopy revealed "sloughing oesophagitis" with extensive mucosal peeling (esophagitis dissecans superficialis). Treatment was intensified with IV methylprednisolone pulses, leading to gradual resolution of gastrointestinal symptoms.

pemphigus_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic pemphigus foliaceus
  presenting_complaint: Sudden flare of erythroderma following UV exposure
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old farmer with stable, localised PF experienced a severe flare after working outdoors in summer. He presented with near-total body erythroderma and significant protein loss. He required hospitalisation for supportive care and a transition from azathioprine to rituximab due to the severity of the relapse.

pemphigus_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Pemphigus vulgaris with ocular complications
  presenting_complaint: Gritty eyes, photophobia, and blurred vision
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male with PV developed bilateral conjunctival erosions and symblepharon formation. Ophthalmology review confirmed cicatricial changes secondary to pemphigus activity. Aggressive systemic control with rituximab was initiated to prevent permanent visual impairment, alongside topical ciclosporin drops.

pemphigus_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Pemphigus vegetans (Hallopeau subtype)
  presenting_complaint: Pustules in the axillae followed by granular plaques
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old woman presented with a milder, more chronic form of vegetating pemphigus. The initial presentation was primarily pustular, which later evolved into verrucous lesions. Histology showed eosinophilic spongiosis, and she achieved remission using oral minocycline and nicotinamide combined with moderate-dose steroids.

pemphigus_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Pemphigus vulgaris with treatment-induced osteoporosis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset back pain and height loss
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old woman on long-term high-dose prednisolone for PV presented with multiple vertebral crush fractures. Her PV was well-controlled, but the morbidity from steroid-induced osteoporosis was significant. Her management plan was revised to include urgent bisphosphonates and an accelerated switch to rituximab to facilitate steroid withdrawal.

pemphigus_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Herpetiform pemphigus
  presenting_complaint: Intensely pruritic clusters of small vesicles
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old man presented with a clinical picture mimicking dermatitis herpetiformis, but with negative coeliac serology. Biopsy showed eosinophilic spongiosis and DIF revealed IgG intercellular deposition. He responded poorly to dapsone but showed excellent clearance with oral prednisolone 0.5mg/kg.

pemphigus_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Pemphigus vulgaris with comorbid Type 2 Diabetes
  presenting_complaint: New oral erosions and poorly controlled blood glucose
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old man with pre-existing T2DM developed PV. The use of systemic steroids led to immediate glycaemic dysregulation and hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS). He was managed with an insulin sliding scale in the hospital while rituximab was fast-tracked as a steroid-sparing agent to allow rapid tapering of prednisolone.

pemphigus_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Pemphigus vulgaris (diagnostic challenge)
  presenting_complaint: Isolated chronic paronychia and nail dystrophy
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old woman presented with recalcitrant inflammation of multiple nail folds. After failing multiple courses of antibiotics and antifungals, a perilesional biopsy was performed when a small blister appeared on the finger. DIF confirmed PV, highlighting an unusual "pemphigus paronychia" presentation; she was started on mycophenolate mofetil with good results.
