schizoaffective_disorder_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type
  presenting_complaint: Acute mania with auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male presented with a 2-week history of pressured speech, decreased need for sleep, and grandiosity, alongside hearing voices commenting on his actions. Mental state examination (MSE) revealed flight of ideas and delusions of reference. He was admitted under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act (MHA) and stabilised on oral risperidone and sodium valproate. He was discharged to the Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP) team with significantly improved mood and resolution of hallucinations.

schizoaffective_disorder_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type
  presenting_complaint: Persistent low mood, suicidal ideation, and nihilistic delusions.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female with a 10-year history of psychiatric contact presented with a 1-month decline in mood and the belief that her internal organs were rotting. She had not responded to previous trials of SSRIs in primary care. Inpatient assessment confirmed schizoaffective disorder (depressive type) after identifying concurrent thought disorder. She was treated with a combination of venlafaxine and quetiapine, resulting in a gradual lifting of mood and cessation of delusional beliefs over six weeks.

schizoaffective_disorder_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type
  presenting_complaint: Relapse of psychotic symptoms following medication non-compliance.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male was brought to A&E by police after acting erratically in public, claiming he was a prophet while exhibiting manic energy. He had ceased his maintenance paliperidone long-acting injection (LAI) three months prior. Physical examination and bloods, including U&Es and LFTs, were unremarkable, excluding organic causes. He was restarted on paliperidone palmitate and referred to the Assertive Outreach Team (AOT) to improve future compliance.

schizoaffective_disorder_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type
  presenting_complaint: Adolescent onset of mood swings and visual hallucinations.
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old female was referred to CAMHS with a 6-month history of fluctuating mood and seeing "shadow figures" regardless of her mood state. Initial diagnostic challenges included differentiating from emerging personality disorder and bipolar affective disorder. Longitudinal assessment confirmed psychotic symptoms persisted during euthymic periods. She was started on low-dose aripiprazole and family therapy, showing moderate improvement in social functioning and school attendance.

schizoaffective_disorder_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Schizoaffective disorder with catatonia
  presenting_complaint: Mutism, waxy flexibility, and refusal to eat or drink.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male with known schizoaffective disorder presented in a catatonic state following a severe depressive episode. He was admitted to a psychiatric intensive care unit (PICU) and required intravenous fluids for dehydration. After failing to respond to high-dose lorazepam (Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale 22), he underwent a course of bilateral Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT). He achieved a full recovery from the catatonic state and was maintained on clozapine.

schizoaffective_disorder_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type
  presenting_complaint: Postpartum psychosis-like presentation with lingering psychotic features.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female presented 3 weeks postpartum with rapid-onset mania and disorganized thinking. While initially treated as puerperal psychosis, her psychotic symptoms (thought withdrawal and third-person hallucinations) persisted long after her mood was stabilised with lithium. A diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder was made. She was managed in a Mother and Baby Unit (MBU) to facilitate bonding while titrating olanzapine, eventually achieving stable remission.

schizoaffective_disorder_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Schizoaffective disorder with comorbid substance misuse
  presenting_complaint: Aggressive behaviour, paranoia, and heavy cannabis use.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male "dual diagnosis" patient presented with acute paranoia and irritability. Distinguishing between cannabis-induced psychosis and a primary psychotic disorder was difficult until a period of enforced abstinence during a hospital stay revealed persistent schizoaffective symptoms. He was treated with zuclopenthixol decanoate and engaged with dual-diagnosis community support. His symptoms remained subacute due to intermittent "spice" use, requiring ongoing intensive community monitoring.

schizoaffective_disorder_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type
  presenting_complaint: Chronic negative symptoms and metabolic syndrome.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with a 20-year history of schizoaffective disorder presented for a physical health check. He was stable psychiatrically on olanzapine but had developed Type 2 diabetes and a BMI of 34. His HbA1c was 62 mmol/mol, and he reported low motivation (negative symptoms). His antipsychotic was switched to aripiprazole to improve his metabolic profile, and he was started on metformin and a structured exercise programme.

schizoaffective_disorder_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Treatment-resistant schizoaffective disorder
  presenting_complaint: Persistent auditory hallucinations despite multiple antipsychotic trials.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female failed to respond to adequate trials of risperidone, quetiapine, and amisulpride over three years. She continued to experience distressing voices and frequent depressive dips. Clozapine was initiated following normal baseline FBC and ECG (QTc 410ms). After six months of clozapine therapy with plasma level monitoring, her hallucinations reduced by 70%, and her mood stabilised significantly.

schizoaffective_disorder_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Late-onset schizoaffective disorder
  presenting_complaint: New-onset grandiose delusions and agitation in an elderly patient.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with no prior psychiatric history presented with a 3-month history of increased energy and the belief he was a secret agent. Brain MRI showed mild small vessel disease but no acute pathology; cognitive screening (ACE-III) was 88/100. He was diagnosed with late-onset schizoaffective disorder (bipolar type). Due to his age and cardiovascular risk, he was started on low-dose quetiapine and monitored closely for orthostatic hypotension.

schizoaffective_disorder_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type
  presenting_complaint: Life-threatening self-harm and profound psychomotor retardation.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female was admitted to ICU following a serious suicide attempt via overdose. Once medically stable, psychiatric assessment revealed she believed her family was being replaced by imposters (Capgras syndrome) amidst a severe depressive episode. She was transferred to a secure mental health ward. Treatment with phenelzine (MAOI) and haloperidol was successful after multiple failed SSRI/SNRI trials, leading to a slow but sustained recovery.

schizoaffective_disorder_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type
  presenting_complaint: Mild hypomania and occasional thought broadcasting.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male software engineer presented with "racing thoughts" and the sensation that others could hear his inner monologue. His symptoms were relatively mild, allowing him to maintain employment with adjustments. He was treated in the community with lamotrigine for mood stabilisation and low-dose lurasidone. This combination successfully managed his symptoms with minimal sedation, allowing him to continue working.

schizoaffective_disorder_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Schizoaffective disorder (Diagnostic Challenge)
  presenting_complaint: Fluctuating psychotic symptoms and mood instability.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old female had been variously diagnosed with Bipolar I and Schizophrenia over 15 years. Careful retrospective review of her notes showed significant periods of psychosis (hallucinations and formal thought disorder) lasting over 4 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms. The diagnosis was clarified as schizoaffective disorder. Her regimen was rationalised to lithium and risperidone, which provided better symptom control than her previous polypharmacy.

schizoaffective_disorder_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Schizoaffective disorder with Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)
  presenting_complaint: High fever, muscle rigidity, and altered consciousness.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male recently started on high-dose haloperidol for acute schizoaffective mania presented to A&E with a temperature of 39.5°C and "lead-pipe" rigidity. Laboratory tests showed a CK of 15,000 U/L and leucocytosis. He was diagnosed with NMS, all antipsychotics were stopped, and he was treated with dantrolene and aggressive rehydration in the ICU. Once recovered, his psychiatric symptoms were cautiously managed with lorazepam and later, a low-potency atypical antipsychotic.

schizoaffective_disorder_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type
  presenting_complaint: Somatic delusions and bereavement-triggered relapse.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female from a South Asian background presented with complaints of "snakes in her stomach" following the death of her husband. While initially appearing as a cultural grief reaction, she also exhibited profound low mood and auditory hallucinations. Diagnostic assessment confirmed schizoaffective disorder. She was treated with mirtazapine and olanzapine, alongside culturally sensitive bereavement counselling, leading to the resolution of her somatic delusions.

schizoaffective_disorder_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (Forensic)
  presenting_complaint: Assault on a family member during a psychotic manic episode.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male with a history of violence when unwell was admitted to a medium-secure unit under Section 37/41 of the MHA. He believed his brother was a demon and exhibited extreme flight of ideas. He was slowly stabilised on a combination of clozapine and lithium. Over two years, his insight improved through intensive rehabilitation, and he was eventually stepped down to a low-secure setting.

schizoaffective_disorder_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type
  presenting_complaint: Management of pregnancy in a patient with chronic psychosis.
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old pregnant female (12 weeks gestation) with schizoaffective disorder requested a medication review. She was currently stable on sodium valproate and quetiapine. Due to the teratogenic risk of valproate, she was transitioned to high-dose folic acid and her mood stabilised with a switch to lithium (with careful monitoring of levels and fetal echoes). She remained well throughout the third trimester under the care of the perinatal mental health team.

schizoaffective_disorder_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type
  presenting_complaint: Social withdrawal, self-neglect, and poverty of speech.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male was found living in squalor by social services. He exhibited significant negative symptoms (alogia, avolition) and reported a constant "heavy" mood and voices telling him he was worthless. He had no prior psychiatric contact. Investigations including a CT head and syphilis serology were negative. He was started on amisulpride, which has some evidence for negative symptoms, and moved into supported accommodation, showing gradual improvement in self-care.

schizoaffective_disorder_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Schizoaffective disorder in Intellectual Disability (ID)
  presenting_complaint: Challenging behaviour and decline in adaptive functioning.
  summary_of_course: An 18-year-old male with mild intellectual disability presented with increased aggression and talking to himself. His presentation was complicated by his limited verbal IQ, making it difficult to elicit delusions. Observations by the ID nursing team noted cyclical mood swings and clear responses to internal stimuli. He was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and responded well to liquid risperidone and a highly structured behavioural plan.

schizoaffective_disorder_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type
  presenting_complaint: Rapid cycling mood and frequent hospitalisations.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female experienced four episodes of mania and two of depression within a 12-month period, each accompanied by vivid hallucinations. Her condition was highly unstable despite various mood stabilisers. She was eventually started on a combination of carbamazepine, lithium, and aripiprazole LAI. This "triple therapy" approach finally achieved diagnostic stability, reducing her hospital admission frequency from three times a year to none in the following 18 months.
