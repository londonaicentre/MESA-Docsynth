oligouria_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Paediatric Dehydration
  presenting_complaint: Reduced wet nappies and lethargy
  summary_of_course: A 2-year-old male presented with a 3-day history of profuse diarrhoea and vomiting. Examination revealed sunken fontanelle and delayed capillary refill, with no urine output for 14 hours. Following a 20ml/kg bolus of 0.9% sodium chloride and subsequent maintenance fluids, the oligouria resolved within 6 hours.

oligouria_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Septic Shock with Acute Kidney Injury
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, fever, and minimal urine output
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with urosepsis was admitted to the ICU with a MAP of 55mmHg. Despite fluid resuscitation, she remained in a state of oligouria with less than 10ml/hr output for 8 consecutive hours. She required noradrenaline support and continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVH) for Stage 3 AKI.

oligouria_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Obstructive Uropathy secondary to BPH
  presenting_complaint: Lower abdominal discomfort and urinary dribbling
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male reported a 24-hour period of severe oligouria, passing only small droplets of urine. Bedside ultrasound confirmed a bladder volume of 1.2L; following urethral catheterisation, a prompt diuresis occurred. Creatinine had risen from a baseline of 90 to 210 µmol/L but normalised post-decompression.

oligouria_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Cardiorenal Syndrome Type 1
  presenting_complaint: Worsening breathlessness and peripheral oedema
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with known HFrEF presented with acute decompensated heart failure. Despite high-dose IV furosemide, he developed progressive oligouria and rising urea, indicating poor renal perfusion. Management required careful titration of inotropes to improve cardiac output and restore renal blood flow.

oligouria_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Rhabdomyolysis
  presenting_complaint: Severe muscle pain and tea-coloured urine
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male was found collapsed after a long-distance run in high temperatures. Laboratory tests showed a CK of 85,000 U/L and significant oligouria with dark, myoglobin-positive urine. Aggressive fluid resuscitation and urinary alkalinisation were initiated to prevent further tubular damage.

oligouria_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Pre-eclampsia with HELLP Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Severe headache and epigastric pain
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old primigravida at 35 weeks gestation presented with a BP of 170/110 mmHg and 3+ proteinuria. She developed acute oligouria (<20ml/hr) alongside haemolysis and low platelets. Emergency caesarean section was performed, and magnesium sulphate was administered; renal function recovered over the following 48 hours.

oligouria_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Contrast-Induced Nephropathy
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic drop in urine output post-procedure
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old diabetic male underwent an urgent coronary angiogram for NSTEMI. Within 48 hours, his urine output dropped to 300ml/day (oligouria) with a 50% rise in serum creatinine. He was managed conservatively with IV hydration, avoiding further nephrotoxins, and renal function returned to baseline by day 7.

oligouria_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN)
  presenting_complaint: Haematuria, malaise, and decreased urine volume
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented with subacute onset of systemic vasculitic symptoms and oligouria. Renal biopsy revealed crescentic formation on histology, and serology was positive for anti-GBM antibodies. She was treated with pulsed methylprednisolone, cyclophosphamide, and plasma exchange to salvage renal function.

oligouria_009:
  primary_diagnosis: NSAID-induced Acute-on-Chronic Kidney Injury
  presenting_complaint: Nausea and reduced urine output
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old with Stage 3b CKD took high-dose ibuprofen for a week for back pain. He presented with moderate oligouria and a creatinine spike to 450 µmol/L. Discontinuation of the NSAID and gentle rehydration led to a partial recovery of renal function, though he remained at a new, lower baseline.

oligouria_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Hepatorenal Syndrome (Type 1)
  presenting_complaint: Increasing abdominal girth and jaundice
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis and refractory ascites developed sudden-onset oligouria. Despite a fluid challenge with 20% albumin, his renal function continued to deteriorate with a sodium excretion <10 mmol/L. Terlipressin was commenced as a bridge to potential liver transplantation.

oligouria_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-operative Hypovolaemia
  presenting_complaint: Low urine output following major abdominal surgery
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old female underwent an elective Whipple’s procedure. Post-operatively, she developed oligouria (<0.5ml/kg/hr) despite what appeared to be adequate fluid intake. Clinical assessment revealed significant third-space losses; increasing the rate of Hartmann's solution successfully restored urine output without the need for diuretics.

oligouria_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (HUS)
  presenting_complaint: Bloody diarrhoea followed by pallor and oligouria
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old girl presented with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) infection. Five days after the onset of diarrhoea, she became oliguric and developed schistocytes on blood film. She required a short period of peritoneal dialysis for fluid overload and uraemia before renal recovery commenced.

oligouria_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Multiple Myeloma with Cast Nephropathy
  presenting_complaint: Bone pain and profound fatigue
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male was investigated for new-onset anaemia and hypercalcaemia. He presented with severe oligouria and a creatinine of 600 µmol/L; urine electrophoresis confirmed Bence-Jones proteinuria. Treatment involved aggressive hydration, correction of hypercalcaemia, and urgent chemotherapy to reduce light chain production.

oligouria_014:
  primary_diagnosis: ANCA-Associated Vasculitis (GPA)
  presenting_complaint: Epistaxis, cough, and tea-coloured urine
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented with a 2-week history of upper respiratory symptoms and new-onset oligouria. PR3-ANCA was strongly positive, and chest X-ray showed pulmonary nodules. He was started on rituximab and steroids, which successfully halted the decline in GFR and improved urine output.

oligouria_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN) due to Major Burns
  presenting_complaint: Severe pain and decreased urine output post-injury
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male suffered 45% total body surface area (TBSA) burns in a house fire. Despite following the Parkland formula for resuscitation, he developed persistent oligouria and metabolic acidosis. This was diagnosed as ATN secondary to combination of hypovolaemic shock and inflammatory cytokine storm, requiring temporary haemodialysis.

oligouria_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Minimal Change Disease
  presenting_complaint: Facial swelling and frothy urine
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old boy presented with sudden-onset periorbital oedema and mild oligouria. Urinalysis showed 4+ protein but no blood, and serum albumin was 18 g/L. He responded rapidly to oral prednisolone, with a significant diuresis and resolution of oedema within 10 days.

oligouria_017:
  primary_diagnosis: End-Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD)
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath and pruritus
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with long-standing diabetic nephropathy reached a GFR of 8 ml/min/1.73m². He presented to the outpatient clinic with chronic oligouria (approx. 300ml/day) and symptomatic uraemia. He was subsequently counselled for the initiation of maintenance haemodialysis via a tunnelled line.

oligouria_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Neurogenic Bladder secondary to Multiple Sclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Inability to void and suprapubic fullness
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old female with relapsing-remitting MS presented with a 12-hour history of oligouria. Examination revealed a palpable bladder to the umbilicus, but the patient felt no urge to urinate due to sensory deficit. Intermittent self-catheterisation was taught as a long-term management strategy for her voiding dysfunction.

oligouria_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Ethylene Glycol Poisoning
  presenting_complaint: Vomiting, ataxia, and anuria
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male was brought to A&E after ingesting antifreeze. He presented with a profound high-anion gap metabolic acidosis and had progressed from oligouria to near-total anuria. Treatment included an ethanol infusion and urgent haemodialysis to remove the glyoxylate metabolites causing tubular crystal deposition.

oligouria_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Malignant Hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Blurred vision and severe headache
  summary_of_course: A 49-year-old male with previously undiagnosed hypertension presented with a BP of 230/140 mmHg and bilateral papilloedema. He was found to have acute oligouria and Stage 2 AKI. Controlled reduction of blood pressure using IV labetalol was performed in a high-dependency setting to prevent further end-organ damage.
