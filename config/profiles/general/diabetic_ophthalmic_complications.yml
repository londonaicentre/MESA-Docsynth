diabetic_ophthalmic_complications_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR)
  presenting_complaint: Routine annual diabetic eye screening.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male with Type 1 DM for 15 years attended screening with no visual symptoms. Fundus photography revealed occasional microaneurysms and scattered blot haemorrhages in the mid-periphery. Visual acuity remained 6/6 bilaterally, and he was advised on stricter glycaemic control with a follow-up in 12 months.

diabetic_ophthalmic_complications_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Vitreous haemorrhage secondary to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of "cobweb" floaters and blurred vision in the right eye.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female with poorly controlled Type 2 DM presented acutely to the eye casualty. Examination confirmed a dense vitreous haemorrhage obscuring retinal detail, with B-scan ultrasonography showing no retinal detachment. She underwent urgent pan-retinal photocoagulation (PRP) to the visible retina and was scheduled for a vitrectomy after two weeks of non-clearing.

diabetic_ophthalmic_complications_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic macular oedema (DMO)
  presenting_complaint: Gradual worsening of central vision and distortion (metamorphopsia).
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with a 20-year history of DM and hypertension reported difficulty reading. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) confirmed significant foveal thickening and intraretinal fluid. He commenced a course of intravitreal anti-VEGF (Aflibercept) injections, resulting in a reduction of central retinal thickness and improvement in vision from 6/18 to 6/9.

diabetic_ophthalmic_complications_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Neovascular glaucoma (NVG)
  presenting_complaint: Severe right eye pain, redness, and nausea.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female with long-standing PDR presented with an intraocular pressure (IOP) of 48 mmHg. Slit-lamp examination revealed rubeosis iridis and an irregular pupil. Management involved immediate topical and systemic IOP-lowering agents, followed by urgent PRP and a subsequent glaucoma drainage device implantation to control the refractory pressure.

diabetic_ophthalmic_complications_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic third nerve palsy
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset double vision and a drooping left eyelid.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male presented with acute binocular diplopia and left-sided ptosis, but with a normal pupillary light reflex (pupil-sparing). Clinical assessment and neuroimaging ruled out an aneurysm, confirming a microvascular ischaemic event. The palsy resolved spontaneously over three months with optimized blood pressure and glucose management.

diabetic_ophthalmic_complications_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Tractional retinal detachment (TRD)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive "curtain" coming across the vision in the left eye.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male with Type 1 DM and chronic renal failure presented with a subacute loss of peripheral vision. Fundoscopy showed fibrovascular membranes causing tractional elevation of the macula. He underwent a complex pars plana vitrectomy, membrane peeling, and endolaser, successfully reattaching the retina.

diabetic_ophthalmic_complications_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Rapidly progressive PDR in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly declining vision during the third trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old pregnant female with pre-existing Type 1 DM showed accelerated retinopathy changes, progressing from mild NPDR to active PDR within three months. Despite the pregnancy, urgent laser photocoagulation was performed to prevent permanent visual loss. Post-partum, her retinopathy stabilized, though she required ongoing close monitoring by the medical retina team.

diabetic_ophthalmic_complications_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic "snowflake" cataract
  presenting_complaint: Rapid onset of bilateral cloudy vision over two weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male recently diagnosed with Type 1 DM in ketoacidosis presented with subcapsular opacities resembling snowflakes. The cataracts progressed rapidly, significantly impairing his vision to 6/60. He underwent bilateral phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation once his systemic metabolic state was stabilized.

diabetic_ophthalmic_complications_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Rhino-orbital mucormycosis
  presenting_complaint: Severe facial pain, proptosis, and complete loss of vision in the right eye.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male in the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis developed acute orbital apex syndrome. Imaging showed invasive fungal sinusitis extending into the orbit. Treatment involved aggressive surgical debridement and intravenous Amphotericin B, but the patient unfortunately required orbital exenteration to control the life-threatening infection.

diabetic_ophthalmic_complications_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, painless loss of the lower half of vision in one eye.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with DM and nocturnal hypotension presented with an altitudinal visual field defect. Fundoscopy revealed a pale, swollen optic disc with splinter haemorrhages. Investigations confirmed a microvascular ischaemic event of the optic nerve head, and management focused on cardiovascular risk factor modification to protect the fellow eye.

diabetic_ophthalmic_complications_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory diabetic macular oedema
  presenting_complaint: Persistent blurred vision despite multiple injections.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female with chronic DMO showed minimal response to twelve monthly anti-VEGF injections. Following a multidisciplinary review, she was switched to an intravitreal dexamethasone (Ozurdex) implant. This resulted in a significant reduction in macular thickness, although she required topical drops for a subsequent moderate rise in intraocular pressure.

diabetic_ophthalmic_complications_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe pre-proliferative diabetic retinopathy
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic but flagged during high-risk screening.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old South Asian male with Type 2 DM and a high HbA1c of 98 mmol/mol was found to have extensive cotton wool spots, venous looping, and intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA) in four quadrants. He was classified as having severe NPDR (R2) and was fast-tracked for laser treatment and intensive systemic management to prevent progression to PDR.

diabetic_ophthalmic_complications_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic sixth nerve palsy
  presenting_complaint: Horizontal double vision, worse when looking to the right.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male with a 10-year history of DM presented with a right abducens nerve palsy. He reported no headache or other neurological deficits. The condition was managed conservatively with a Fresnel prism on his glasses to alleviate diplopia, and the palsy resolved completely within 10 weeks.

diabetic_ophthalmic_complications_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent vitreous haemorrhage post-laser
  presenting_complaint: New floaters and "streaks" in vision.
  summary_of_course: A 53-year-old female who previously had full PRP for PDR presented with a fresh vitreous bleed. Examination revealed a small tuft of persistent neovascularization at the disc (NVD) that had bled. Supplemental laser was applied to the ischaemic peripheral retina, and the haemorrhage cleared over the following month.

diabetic_ophthalmic_complications_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic neurotrophic keratopathy
  presenting_complaint: Gritty sensation and redness, but no pain.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with long-standing DM and peripheral neuropathy presented with a persistent corneal epithelial defect. Despite the clinical appearance of a significant ulcer, the patient reported no pain due to corneal anaesthesia. Treatment involved intensive lubrication and a bandage contact lens, with slow healing noted over several weeks.

diabetic_ophthalmic_complications_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Phthisis bulbi secondary to advanced diabetic eye disease
  presenting_complaint: Shrunken, sightless, and occasionally painful left eye.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with a history of multiple failed retinal surgeries for diabetic TRD presented with a non-seeing eye (No Light Perception). The eye was soft (hypotony) and had become disfigured over time. Management was palliative, focusing on topical lubricants and considering enucleation for chronic pain.

diabetic_ophthalmic_complications_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Clinically significant macular oedema (CSME)
  presenting_complaint: Mild blurring of central vision when sewing.
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old female was found to have retinal thickening and hard exudates within 500 microns of the foveal centre. While her visual acuity was still 6/9, she met the ETDRS criteria for CSME. She was treated with focal argon laser photocoagulation to the leaking microaneurysms, which stabilized the exudation.

diabetic_ophthalmic_complications_018:
  primary_diagnosis: PDR with rubeosis iridis (pre-glaucoma)
  presenting_complaint: Floaters and mild ocular ache.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male with Type 1 DM and poor clinic attendance presented with NVD and fine new vessels on the iris surface (rubeosis). His IOP was currently normal at 16 mmHg. He received urgent, high-intensity PRP to induce regression of the iris vessels and prevent the development of neovascular glaucoma.

diabetic_ophthalmic_complications_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic fourth nerve palsy
  presenting_complaint: Vertical double vision, especially when reading or walking downstairs.
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old female with DM presented with a compensatory head tilt. Examination confirmed a right superior oblique palsy of microvascular origin. She was monitored closely, and her symptoms resolved over 4 months without surgical intervention, aided by temporary occlusion of one lens.

diabetic_ophthalmic_complications_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Ischaemic diabetic maculopathy
  presenting_complaint: Significant loss of central vision despite "clear" retina.
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male with Type 2 DM presented with 6/60 vision. OCT showed no significant oedema, but fluorescein angiography revealed a markedly enlarged and irregular foveal avascular zone (FAZ). He was diagnosed with macular ischaemia, for which there is currently no effective surgical or medical treatment, and was referred for low vision aids.
