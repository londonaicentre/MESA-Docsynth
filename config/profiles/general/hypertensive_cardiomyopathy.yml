  primary_diagnosis: Hypertensive cardiomyopathy with HFpEF
  presenting_complaint: Gradual onset of exertional breathlessness over six months.
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male with a 15-year history of poorly controlled hypertension presented to his GP. Echocardiography revealed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with a preserved ejection fraction (EF) of 58% and Grade II diastolic dysfunction. He was commenced on perindopril and indapamide, resulting in symptomatic improvement and stabilised blood pressure readings.

hypertensive_cardiomyopathy_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute decompensated hypertensive cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset orthopnoea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female with known hypertension and obesity was admitted with flash pulmonary oedema. Clinical examination revealed a BP of 210/115 mmHg and bilateral basal crackles, while the ECG showed LVH with strain pattern. She was treated with intravenous furosemide and GTN infusion, eventually transitioning to oral bisoprolol and ramipril before discharge.

hypertensive_cardiomyopathy_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypertensive cardiomyopathy with HFrEF
  presenting_complaint: Persistent fatigue and bilateral ankle swelling.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male, previously non-compliant with antihypertensive medication, presented with signs of congestive heart failure. Investigations confirmed a dilated left ventricle with a reduced ejection fraction of 32% and significant wall thickening. He was established on quadruple therapy (sacubitril/valsartan, dapagliflozin, bisoprolol, and spironolactone) with a slow recovery of systolic function.

hypertensive_cardiomyopathy_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypertensive cardiomyopathy with secondary atrial fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations and lightheadedness.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with long-standing hypertension presented in rapid atrial fibrillation. Imaging showed a severely dilated left atrium and concentric LVH consistent with hypertensive heart disease. He underwent rate control with digoxin and was started on apixaban for stroke prevention alongside intensified antihypertensive therapy.

hypertensive_cardiomyopathy_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric hypertensive cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent headaches and exercise intolerance.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old male was found to have a BP of 160/100 mmHg during a routine school check-up. Further investigations identified bilateral renal artery stenosis causing secondary hypertension and significant LVH on echocardiogram. Following successful renal angioplasty and temporary amlodipine use, the cardiomyopathy showed signs of regression over 18 months.

hypertensive_cardiomyopathy_006:
  primary_diagnosis: End-stage hypertensive cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Severe dyspnoea at rest and cardiac cachexia.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old female with a 40-year history of hypertension presented with NYHA Class IV symptoms. Despite maximal medical therapy, she experienced recurrent hospitalisations for decompensation and worsening renal function. Palliative care was initiated focusing on symptom management with low-dose diuretics and opiates.

hypertensive_cardiomyopathy_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypertensive cardiomyopathy mimicking hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Atypical chest pain and syncopal episodes.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male presented with significant asymmetrical septal hypertrophy on echocardiography, initially raising suspicion of HCM. However, a history of refractory hypertension and lack of genetic markers led to a diagnosis of hypertensive cardiomyopathy with an outflow tract gradient. Aggressive BP control with beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors resulted in a reduction of the septal thickness and resolution of syncope.

hypertensive_cardiomyopathy_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypertensive cardiomyopathy with chronic kidney disease
  presenting_complaint: Uraemic symptoms and fluid overload.
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male with Stage 4 CKD and resistant hypertension presented with worsening peripheral oedema. Echocardiography showed severe LVH and impaired relaxation, complicated by the patient's inability to tolerate high-dose ACE inhibitors due to hyperkalaemia. Management required a complex regimen of hydralazine, nitrates, and loop diuretics to manage both his cardiac and renal demands.

hypertensive_cardiomyopathy_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic hypertensive cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Worsening shortness of breath following a high-salt meal.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old female with known hypertensive heart disease presented with acute respiratory distress. Her BP was 195/105 mmHg and NT-proBNP was significantly elevated at 4500 pg/mL. She responded well to aggressive diuresis and the addition of an SGLT2 inhibitor to her chronic heart failure regimen.

hypertensive_cardiomyopathy_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypertensive cardiomyopathy with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF)
  presenting_complaint: Mild dyspnoea and reduced stamina.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male smoker with untreated hypertension was found to have an EF of 45% and significant LVH. Cardiac MRI ruled out ischaemic heart disease and confirmed interstitial fibrosis. He was started on a smoking cessation programme and a combination of lisinopril and carvedilol, showing improvement in EF to 52% after one year.

hypertensive_cardiomyopathy_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypertensive cardiomyopathy with hypertensive encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, seizures, and severe headache.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented in a hypertensive emergency with a BP of 230/130 mmHg. Alongside neurological symptoms, she had acute LV failure and pulmonary congestion. Following stabilisation with IV labetalol in the ICU, long-term management focused on multi-drug antihypertensive therapy to prevent further cardiac remodelling.

hypertensive_cardiomyopathy_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Silent hypertensive cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of LVH on preoperative ECG.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old asymptomatic male undergoing assessment for elective hernia repair was found to have profound voltage criteria for LVH. Subsequent echocardiography confirmed significant wall thickening and impaired diastolic filling despite the patient claiming no symptoms. Surgery was deferred until his BP was optimised and his functional capacity was formally assessed via a stress test.

hypertensive_cardiomyopathy_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypertensive cardiomyopathy in a patient with OSA
  presenting_complaint: Daytime somnolence and nocturnal gasping.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and resistant hypertension showed concentric LVH on screening. The cardiomyopathy was attributed to the synergistic effects of chronic pressure overload and nocturnal hypoxic surges. Initiation of CPAP therapy alongside spironolactone led to a significant reduction in nocturnal BP and gradual regression of LV mass.

hypertensive_cardiomyopathy_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypertensive cardiomyopathy with valvular regurgitation
  presenting_complaint: Dyspnoea and a pansystolic murmur.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old female with long-standing hypertension presented with functional mitral regurgitation secondary to LV dilatation and remodelling. Echocardiography showed a "burned-out" hypertensive phenotype with a dilated, thin-walled LV and an EF of 35%. She was managed with heart failure medications and considered for a transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) due to persistent symptoms.

hypertensive_cardiomyopathy_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypertensive cardiomyopathy in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Severe hypertension and breathlessness at 32 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old pregnant female with pre-existing hypertension developed superimposed pre-eclampsia and acute heart failure. Echocardiography showed acute LV strain and hypertrophy. She required urgent delivery via C-section and postpartum management with labetalol and enalapril once safe, with gradual recovery of cardiac function.

hypertensive_cardiomyopathy_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypertensive cardiomyopathy with ischaemic stroke
  presenting_complaint: Right-sided weakness and facial droop.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male presented with an acute embolic stroke; investigations revealed LVH and a dilated left atrium, but no primary vascular stenosis. The cardiomyopathy was identified as the substrate for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which had caused the embolic event. Treatment involved thrombolysis followed by anticoagulation and aggressive BP management to prevent further cardiac and cerebral damage.

hypertensive_cardiomyopathy_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypertensive cardiomyopathy in a young adult
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations during high-intensity exercise.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male with a history of anabolic steroid misuse and severe hypertension presented with LVH on ECG. Cardiac MRI showed significant concentric hypertrophy and focal areas of late gadolinium enhancement. Cessation of steroid use and commencement of losartan resulted in partial reversal of the cardiomyopathy over two years.

hypertensive_cardiomyopathy_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypertensive cardiomyopathy with restrictive physiology
  presenting_complaint: Elevated JVP and hepatomegaly.
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old male with chronic hypertension presented with signs of right-sided heart failure. Echocardiography revealed severe LVH with a restrictive filling pattern and preserved EF, mimicking restrictive cardiomyopathy. Clinical correlation confirmed hypertensive heart disease as the primary driver, and he was managed with cautious diuresis and strict BP targets.

hypertensive_cardiomyopathy_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypertensive cardiomyopathy with exercise-induced pulmonary oedema
  presenting_complaint: Sudden breathlessness only during brisk walking.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female with borderline hypertension showed normal resting cardiac function but developed acute diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary venous hypertension during stress echocardiography. This "masked" hypertensive cardiomyopathy was treated with amlodipine and lifestyle modifications, which successfully abolished her exertional symptoms.

hypertensive_cardiomyopathy_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory hypertensive cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Persistent NYHA III symptoms despite five antihypertensive agents.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with resistant hypertension and progressive LV dilatation failed to respond to standard medical therapy. Renal denervation was performed as an adjunctive treatment, which successfully lowered his systolic BP by 20 mmHg. Following the procedure, his LV mass began to regress and his exercise tolerance improved significantly over the following year.
