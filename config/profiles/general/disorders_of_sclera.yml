disorders_of_sclera_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Simple episcleritis
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of redness and mild gritty sensation in the right eye.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old healthy female presented with sectorial conjunctival injection that blanched with phenylephrine 10%. She reported no significant pain or photophobia. The condition was diagnosed as simple episcleritis and resolved within ten days using chilled artificial tears and a short course of topical Flurprofen.

disorders_of_sclera_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Nodular episcleritis
  presenting_complaint: A localized, painful red lump on the white of the left eye.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented with a distinct, mobile nodule over the temporal sclera associated with moderate tenderness. Clinical examination confirmed nodular episcleritis with no evidence of systemic inflammatory disease on initial screening. He responded well to a two-week course of topical Fluorometholone drops, with complete resolution of the nodule.

disorders_of_sclera_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Diffuse anterior scleritis
  presenting_complaint: Severe, boring pain in the left eye radiating to the temple, worsening at night.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis presented with deep violaceous hue of the sclera and intense globe tenderness. Slit-lamp examination showed diffuse scleral oedema and non-blanching vessels under topical phenylephrine. She was started on high-dose oral Ibuprofen and required a temporary increase in her Methotrexate dose to achieve remission.

disorders_of_sclera_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Nodular anterior scleritis
  presenting_complaint: Multiple painful, red nodules on the right eye and blurred vision.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male presented with three distinct, non-mobile scleral nodules and significant ocular pain. Investigations revealed an elevated ESR and positive ANA, suggesting underlying connective tissue disease. Treatment involved oral Prednisolone 60mg daily, tapering slowly over three months, which successfully reduced the nodules and preserved visual acuity.

disorders_of_sclera_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Necrotising scleritis with inflammation
  presenting_complaint: Excruciating ocular pain and visible thinning of the white of the eye.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) presented with an avascular zone of sclera surrounded by intense inflammation. Urgent B-scan ultrasound was performed to rule out posterior involvement, and she was admitted for intravenous Methylprednisolone pulses. Despite aggressive immunosuppression with Rituximab, she developed significant scleral thinning requiring a donor scleral patch graft.

disorders_of_sclera_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Scleromalacia perforans
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic change in eye colour, with dark patches appearing on the sclera.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female with a 30-year history of erosive rheumatoid arthritis presented with painless scleral thinning and "uveal show" (blue-black appearance of underlying uvea). There was no active inflammation or pain, characteristic of necrotising scleritis without inflammation. Management focused on lubricating the ocular surface and intensive systemic control of her RA to prevent further progression.

disorders_of_sclera_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Posterior scleritis
  presenting_complaint: Rapid onset of vision loss, periocular pain, and double vision.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female presented with reduced visual acuity (6/24) and restricted eye movements. Fundoscopy revealed choroidal folds and optic disc oedema, while B-scan ultrasonography demonstrated the classic "T-sign" indicating fluid in Tenon's space. She was treated with systemic corticosteroids and showed rapid improvement in vision and resolution of the T-sign within two weeks.

disorders_of_sclera_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Traumatic scleral rupture
  presenting_complaint: Sudden loss of vision and bleeding after being struck by a high-velocity squash ball.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male presented with a "black cherry" appearance of the globe and a 360-degree subconjunctival haemorrhage. CT imaging confirmed a ruptured globe with scleral laceration posterior to the muscle insertions. He underwent emergency surgical exploration and primary repair of the 8mm scleral wound, followed by a prolonged course of intravitreal antibiotics to prevent endophthalmitis.

disorders_of_sclera_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Osteogenesis imperfecta (Type I)
  presenting_complaint: Paediatric patient presenting for routine eye check with noticeably blue sclerae.
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old boy with a history of multiple low-impact long bone fractures was noted to have deep blue-tinted sclerae bilaterally. Clinical evaluation confirmed the hue was due to uveal pigment shining through a pathologically thin sclera. He was referred to genetics and metabolic paediatrics for management of his Type I Osteogenesis imperfecta, with no active ophthalmic treatment required.

disorders_of_sclera_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Senile hyaline plaque
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of greyish spots on the eyes during a cataract assessment.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male was noted to have bilateral, vertically oval, slate-grey translucent areas in the sclera just anterior to the horizontal rectus muscle insertions. These were identified as senile hyaline plaques, a benign degenerative change related to age and chronic actinic exposure. No treatment was necessary, and the patient was reassured of their harmless nature.

disorders_of_sclera_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Minocycline-induced scleral pigmentation
  presenting_complaint: Gradual development of a blue-grey band on the white of both eyes.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male who had been taking Minocycline for acne rosacea for over five years presented with a distinct pigmentary band in the mid-peripheral sclera. The pigmentation was most prominent in the interpalpebral zone and was confirmed to be drug-induced. The medication was discontinued, though the patient was advised that the scleral discolouration might be permanent or take years to fade.

disorders_of_sclera_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Infectious scleritis (Pseudomonas aeruginosa)
  presenting_complaint: Severe pain, purulent discharge, and a rapidly enlarging white ulcer on the sclera.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male, three weeks post-pterygium surgery with Mitomycin C, presented with a focal scleral abscess. Cultures were positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, likely complicating the post-operative avascular bed. He required intensive topical and subconjunctival Fortum (Ceftazidime) and ultimately surgical debridement of the necrotic scleral tissue to control the infection.

disorders_of_sclera_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Posterior staphyloma
  presenting_complaint: Progressive worsening of vision and high myopia.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female with -12.00D myopia presented with reduced corrected acuity and metamorphopsia. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and B-scan showed a localized posterior bulging of the sclera at the macula, consistent with a posterior staphyloma. Management was supportive, focusing on monitoring for associated myopic choroidal neovascularisation and retinal detachment.

disorders_of_sclera_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Scleral icterus
  presenting_complaint: Deep yellow discolouration of the eyes and generalized malaise.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis was admitted to the ICU with multi-organ failure. Physical examination revealed profound scleral icterus due to a total bilirubin of 450 µmol/L. While the sclera itself was not diseased, the accumulation of conjugated bilirubin in the scleral collagen served as a critical clinical indicator of his hepatic status.

disorders_of_sclera_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Relapsing polychondritis-associated scleritis
  presenting_complaint: Painful red eyes accompanied by a swollen, tender right ear.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female presented with bilateral diffuse anterior scleritis and significant inflammation of the auricular cartilage, sparing the lobule. Biopsy of the ear confirmed relapsing polychondritis, an autoimmune condition targeting type II collagen. She was managed with a combination of oral Prednisolone and Azathioprine, which successfully controlled both the ocular and cartilaginous inflammation.

disorders_of_sclera_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory idiopathic scleritis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent ocular pain and redness despite six months of various treatments.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male with no identifiable systemic disease failed to respond to high-dose steroids, Methotrexate, and Mycophenolate Mofetil. His scleritis remained active with progressive thinning and constant "boring" pain. He was eventually transitioned to Rituximab infusions, which finally induced clinical remission and allowed for the tapering of systemic steroids.

disorders_of_sclera_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Surgically induced scleral necrosis (SISON)
  presenting_complaint: Pain and "melting" of the sclera at a previous surgical site.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female presented with localized scleral melting at the site of a bare-sclera pterygium excision performed ten years prior. The area showed significant thinning with minimal active inflammation, consistent with late-onset SISON. She was treated with topical lubricants and oral Tetracycline for its anti-collagenase effect, and a tectonic corneal-scleral patch graft was planned due to the risk of perforation.

disorders_of_sclera_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Syphilitic scleritis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic, bilateral red eyes that are unresponsive to conventional anti-inflammatory drops.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male presented with subacute nodular scleritis. Routine screening for infectious causes revealed a reactive TPPA and RPR titre of 1:64, confirming secondary syphilis. He was treated with a course of intramuscular Benzathine Penicillin, which led to the complete resolution of the scleral inflammation without the need for long-term immunosuppression.

disorders_of_sclera_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Ochronosis (Alkaptonuria)
  presenting_complaint: Slate-blue pigmentation of the sclera and darkening of the urine.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male presented with bilateral, symmetrical triangular patches of pigmentation in the sclera near the rectus muscle insertions. He also reported chronic joint pain and that his urine turned black upon standing. Diagnosis of Alkaptonuria was confirmed by urinary homogentisic acid assay, and the scleral findings were identified as ochronotic pigment deposition.

disorders_of_sclera_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic scleritis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden flare of intense eye pain in a patient with known Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female with long-standing SLE and previously stable scleritis presented with an acute exacerbation after self-discontinuing her Hydroxychloroquine. Examination showed active diffuse anterior scleritis with overlying episcleral congestion and early peripheral ulcerative keratitis. She required an emergency pulse of intravenous Cyclophosphamide and the resumption of her maintenance therapy to stabilize the globe.
