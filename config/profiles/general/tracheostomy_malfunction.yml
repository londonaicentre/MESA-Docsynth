tracheostomy_malfunction_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute tracheostomy tube obstruction
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset respiratory distress and inability to pass a suction catheter.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male in the ICU for weaning following prolonged ventilation developed acute hypoxia and agitation. Clinical examination revealed absent breath sounds through the tracheostomy and high peak airway pressures on the ventilator; attempts to pass a suction catheter failed due to a thick mucus plug. The inner cannula was removed and cleaned, and the outer tube was eventually exchanged over a soft tip guidewire, resulting in immediate stabilisation of oxygen saturations.

tracheostomy_malfunction_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Accidental paediatric decannulation
  presenting_complaint: Tracheostomy tube found lying on the bedsheets by parents.
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old girl with subglottic stenosis was brought to the A&E after her tracheostomy tube was accidentally dislodged during play. On arrival, she was tachypnoeic with mild subcostal recession but maintaining saturations on room air via her upper airway. A new Shiley paediatric tube was successfully reinserted by the ENT registrar, and the stoma was checked for trauma before discharge with a follow-up appointment.

tracheostomy_malfunction_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Tracheostomy cuff leak
  presenting_complaint: Audible air leak from the mouth and inability to maintain tidal volumes on the ventilator.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with motor neurone disease on home ventilation presented with recurrent low-volume ventilator alarms. Assessment revealed a pilot balloon that remained deflated despite air injection, confirming a ruptured cuff. The tracheostomy tube was replaced in the outpatient clinic under controlled conditions, restoring the closed circuit for nocturnal ventilation.

tracheostomy_malfunction_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Tracheal granulation tissue obstruction
  presenting_complaint: Progressive difficulty breathing and minor haemoptysis over two weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with a long-term tracheostomy for vocal cord palsy reported worsening stridor and blood-tinged secretions. Flexible bronchoscopy through the stoma identified exuberant granulation tissue at the distal tip of the tube partially occluding the lumen. The patient underwent microlaryngoscopy and laser excision of the granulation tissue, followed by a change to a longer-length tracheostomy tube to bypass the affected area.

tracheostomy_malfunction_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Tracheostomy tube malposition (False Passage)
  presenting_complaint: Massive subcutaneous emphysema and respiratory distress following a tube change.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male underwent a routine tracheostomy tube change in the community by a district nurse, which was immediately followed by neck swelling and desaturation. On admission to the surgical assessment unit, imaging confirmed the tube tip was located in the pre-tracheal soft tissues rather than the lumen. The tube was removed, and the airway was secured via oral intubation before a formal surgical re-stenting of the stoma was performed.

tracheostomy_malfunction_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Tracheoinnominate artery fistula
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, massive arterial haemorrhage from the tracheostomy stoma.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old patient, three weeks post-surgical tracheostomy for head and neck cancer, experienced a "sentinel bleed" followed by catastrophic haemorrhage. Emergency management involved over-inflation of the tracheostomy cuff and digital compression of the artery against the sternum via the stoma. The patient was rushed to theatre for a median sternotomy and ligation of the innominate artery, surviving with significant morbidity.

tracheostomy_malfunction_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Tracheostomy tube fracture and aspiration
  presenting_complaint: Chronic cough and persistent wheeze unresponsive to bronchodilators.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old female with a silver Chevalier Jackson tube of many years' duration presented with a missing distal segment of the inner cannula. A chest X-ray revealed a radio-opaque foreign body in the right lower lobe bronchus, consistent with a fractured tube fragment. The fragment was successfully retrieved via rigid bronchoscopy, and the patient was transitioned to a modern PVC tracheostomy tube.

tracheostomy_malfunction_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Tracheomalacia with dynamic tube occlusion
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent respiratory distress triggered by coughing or positional changes.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with a history of prolonged intubation presented with episodes where he felt the tracheostomy "sucking shut." Dynamic CT imaging and bronchoscopy showed significant tracheomalacia, where the tracheal wall collapsed against the distal end of the tracheostomy tube during expiration. The management involved switching to a reinforced, adjustable-flange tracheostomy tube to provide better internal stenting of the airway.

tracheostomy_malfunction_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Obstructed fenestrated tracheostomy tube
  presenting_complaint: Inability to voice and increased work of breathing when the tube was plugged.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old female using a fenestrated tube for weaning reported that she could no longer breathe through her nose or mouth when the decannulation plug was in place. Endoscopy revealed that the fenestration was misaligned with her anatomy and had become occluded by the posterior tracheal wall. The tube was replaced with a non-fenestrated version and a speaking valve trial was initiated under speech and language therapy supervision.

tracheostomy_malfunction_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Tracheostomy-associated stomal infection and necrosis
  presenting_complaint: Foul-smelling discharge, pain around the stoma, and tube instability.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old diabetic patient presented with erythema and purulent discharge around his long-term tracheostomy site. Examination showed significant skin breakdown and tissue necrosis, causing the stoma to widen and the tube to sit loosely, leading to air leaks. Treatment included systemic antibiotics, intensive wound care, and the temporary use of a larger diameter tube to maintain the airway until the infection resolved.

tracheostomy_malfunction_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Pilot balloon valve failure
  presenting_complaint: Continuous air leak despite the pilot balloon appearing inflated.
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old ICU patient on mechanical ventilation had persistent low-pressure alarms. While the pilot balloon felt tense, a check with a cuff manometer showed zero pressure within the tracheostomy cuff itself, indicating a one-way valve failure in the pilot line. The tracheostomy tube was replaced over a bougie to ensure continued ventilatory support.

tracheostomy_malfunction_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent aspiration pneumonia and gastric contents appearing in tracheal secretions.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with a history of high-pressure cuff requirements for ventilation presented with coughing during enteral feeds. Methylene blue test confirmed the presence of a fistula between the trachea and oesophagus, likely caused by pressure necrosis from the tracheostomy cuff. The patient required a gastrostomy for feeding and a surgical repair of the fistula with a muscle flap interposition.

tracheostomy_malfunction_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Suction catheter entrapment
  presenting_complaint: Suction catheter stuck inside the tracheostomy tube, unable to be withdrawn.
  summary_of_course: During routine care of a 30-year-old tetraplegic patient, a suction catheter became wedged in the fenestration of the tracheostomy tube. The patient became distressed as the catheter partially occluded the airway. The entire tracheostomy tube and the entrapped catheter were removed as a single unit, and a new tube was inserted immediately with no long-term sequelae.

tracheostomy_malfunction_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Distal migration of tracheostomy tube
  presenting_complaint: Unilateral breath sounds and high airway pressures.
  summary_of_course: A morbidly obese 52-year-old female with a long-length adjustable flange tube presented with sudden desaturation. Auscultation revealed absent breath sounds on the left, and a chest X-ray confirmed the tube had migrated distally into the right main bronchus. The flange was adjusted to pull the tube back into the mid-trachea, and the position was confirmed with a bedside fibreoptic scope.

tracheostomy_malfunction_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Stomal stenosis preventing reinsertion
  presenting_complaint: Inability to reinsert the tracheostomy tube after routine cleaning.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female with a chronic stoma removed her tube for cleaning but was unable to reinsert it after 20 minutes. Upon arrival at the emergency department, the stoma had narrowed significantly due to rapid contracture and surrounding oedema. The airway was initially managed with a smaller diameter paediatric tube before the stoma was surgically dilated the following day.

tracheostomy_malfunction_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Tracheostomy tube displacement in an obese patient
  presenting_complaint: Sudden loss of capnography trace and rapid desaturation.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old patient with a BMI of 55 was being turned in the ICU when the tracheostomy tube became displaced into the thick pre-tracheal fat. Because of the patient's neck anatomy, the stoma was not easily visible, and bag-mask ventilation was difficult. An emergency surgical airway team performed a formal re-entry into the trachea to restore the airway.

tracheostomy_malfunction_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Biofilm-induced tube occlusion
  presenting_complaint: Subacute increase in work of breathing and noisy respirations.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with dementia and a long-term tracheostomy presented with a three-day history of "whistling" sounds during inspiration. Inspection of the inner cannula revealed a thick, hardened biofilm and crusting that had narrowed the internal diameter by 50%. The patient's family were retrained on the importance of twice-daily inner cannula cleaning, and a new tube was issued.

tracheostomy_malfunction_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Tracheostomy cuff herniation
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent airway obstruction that resolves when the cuff is deflated.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female on a ventilator experienced episodes of high peak pressures where the ventilator could not deliver a breath. Fibreoptic inspection revealed that the over-inflated cuff was herniating over the distal tip of the tracheostomy tube, acting as a valve. The cuff was partially deflated to the minimum occlusive volume, which resolved the intermittent obstruction.

tracheostomy_malfunction_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute stomal granuloma bleed
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent minor bleeding from around the tracheostomy site.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male with a tracheostomy following a traumatic brain injury presented with persistent oozing from the stoma. Examination revealed a large, friable granuloma at the superior edge of the stoma, likely caused by friction from the tube flange. The granuloma was treated with silver nitrate cautery in the outpatient department, and a different style of tube holder was used to reduce movement.

tracheostomy_malfunction_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Tracheostomy tube kinking
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty passing a suction catheter and persistent ventilator "low flow" alarms.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old child with a flexible, wire-reinforced tracheostomy tube was found to have the tube kinked at the level of the stoma due to the weight of the ventilator circuit. The kinking caused a partial obstruction of the lumen. A circuit support arm was implemented to take the tension off the tube, and the kinked tube was replaced to ensure structural integrity was maintained.
