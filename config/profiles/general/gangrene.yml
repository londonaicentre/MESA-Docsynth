gangrene_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic wet gangrene
  presenting_complaint: Malodorous, blackened right hallux with purulent discharge and systemic malaise.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes presented with a two-week history of a non-healing foot ulcer. Examination revealed extensive liquefactive necrosis of the first and second digits with surrounding cellulitis and crepitus. Urgent surgical debridement and a ray amputation were performed alongside IV piperacillin/tazobactam, following a diagnosis of wet gangrene secondary to peripheral neuropathy and ischaemia.

gangrene_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Fournier's gangrene
  presenting_complaint: Severe scrotal pain, swelling, and rapid skin discolouration.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol excess presented in septic shock with a BP of 85/50 mmHg. Physical examination showed necrotic patches on the scrotum and perineum with palpable surgical emphysema. He underwent emergency wide surgical debridement of the perineal fascia and was managed in the ICU with multi-organ support and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

gangrene_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Gas gangrene (Clostridial myonecrosis)
  presenting_complaint: Intense pain and bronze discolouration of the left thigh following a traumatic garden injury.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female sustained a deep laceration from a rusty fence post 48 hours prior to admission. She developed rapid-onset muscle necrosis, tachycardia, and a characteristic "mousy" odour from the wound. Radiography confirmed extensive gas within the soft tissue planes; she was treated with emergency radical debridement, high-dose penicillin, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

gangrene_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Dry gangrene of the digits
  presenting_complaint: Painless, shrivelled, black toes on the left foot.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with advanced peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and a 50-pack-year smoking history presented with mummification of the third and fourth toes. Clinical examination showed no signs of infection or cellulitis, consistent with chronic dry gangrene due to atherosclerotic occlusion. Management was conservative with a "watch and wait" approach to allow for auto-amputation, supported by secondary vascular prevention.

gangrene_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Gangrenous cholecystitis
  presenting_complaint: Acute, severe right upper quadrant pain, vomiting, and high fever.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male with known gallstones presented with peritonism in the RUQ and a CRP of 350 mg/L. An emergency CT scan suggested a perforated gallbladder with pericholecystic fluid. During emergency laparoscopic-to-open cholecystectomy, the gallbladder was found to be gangrenous and friable, requiring extensive peritoneal washout and a prolonged course of IV antibiotics.

gangrene_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Purpura fulminans with peripheral gangrene
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly spreading purple rash and cold, cyanotic extremities.
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old boy was admitted with Meningococcal septicaemia and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Despite aggressive resuscitation and protein C replacement, he developed symmetrical peripheral gangrene of both feet and several fingers. Following stabilisation, he required bilateral below-knee amputations once the areas of necrosis had demarcated.

gangrene_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Gangrenous bowel (Mesenteric ischaemia)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset, generalised abdominal pain "out of proportion" to clinical findings.
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old male with atrial fibrillation and sub-therapeutic INR presented with acute abdominal distress and metabolic acidosis (lactate 8.2 mmol/L). An urgent CT angiogram revealed an SMA embolus and pneumatosis intestinalis. Laparotomy confirmed 1.5 metres of gangrenous small bowel, which was resected, leaving the patient with short bowel syndrome.

gangrene_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Meleney's gangrene (Synergistic gangrene)
  presenting_complaint: Slowly enlarging, painful, necrotic skin ulcer following abdominal surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female developed a superficial wound infection after an elective hernia repair. Over three weeks, the site evolved into a painful ulcer with a central necrotic zone and a violaceous border, characteristic of synergistic bacterial gangrene. Treatment involved repeated surgical debridement and a combination of antibiotics targeting both aerobic and anaerobic organisms.

gangrene_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Digital gangrene secondary to Buerger's disease
  presenting_complaint: Extremely painful, blue-black discolouration of the fingertips.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male, a heavy smoker, presented with Raynaud-like symptoms and progressive ischaemic changes in his right hand. Angiography showed "corkscrew" collaterals and distal arterial occlusions consistent with Thromboangiitis obliterans. Despite smoking cessation advice, he developed focal gangrene of the index finger requiring distal phalanx amputation.

gangrene_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Gangrenous appendicitis
  presenting_complaint: Migrating abdominal pain to the right iliac fossa with rigors.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male presented with a 24-hour history of worsening RIF pain and a white cell count of 19 x 10^9/L. At appendicectomy, the appendix was found to be gangrenous at the tip with localized perforation and an appendicolith. He recovered well following surgery and a 5-day course of co-amoxiclav.

gangrene_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Calciphylaxis with skin gangrene
  presenting_complaint: Exquisitely painful, necrotic skin plaques on the bilateral thighs.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on haemodialysis presented with livedo reticularis that progressed to ischaemic necrosis. Skin biopsy confirmed calcific uraemic arteriolopathy. Despite wound care and sodium thiosulphate therapy, the gangrenous areas became infected, leading to fatal sepsis.

gangrene_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Symmetrical Peripheral Gangrene (SPG)
  presenting_complaint: Symmetrical blackening of the fingers and toes without major vessel occlusion.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female in the ICU for septic shock secondary to pneumonia required high-dose noradrenaline for vasopressor-refractory hypotension. On day 4, she developed cyanosis and subsequent dry gangrene of all ten toes and several fingertips despite palpable proximal pulses. The gangrene was attributed to low-flow state and vasopressor-induced peripheral vasoconstriction.

gangrene_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Gangrene secondary to Frostbite
  presenting_complaint: Numb, hard, cold feet that turned black after rewarming.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old homeless male was found unresponsive in sub-zero temperatures. Following slow rewarming, he developed haemorrhagic blisters and subsequent deep tissue gangrene of the forefeet. He was treated with iloprost infusions to improve microcirculation, but eventually required bilateral Forefoot (transmetatarsal) amputations.

gangrene_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Venous gangrene (Phlegmasia cerulea dolens)
  presenting_complaint: Massive swelling, cyanosis, and severe pain of the entire left leg.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer presented with an acute, extensive DVT involving the iliofemoral segment. The limb became "wooden" and cyanotic due to total venous outflow obstruction leading to secondary arterial compromise. Despite emergency catheter-directed thrombolysis, focal areas of venous gangrene developed on the calf, necessitating skin grafting.

gangrene_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Infected Grade 4 pressure ulcer with gangrene
  presenting_complaint: Deep, foul-smelling hole in the lower back with visible bone and black tissue.
  summary_of_course: A 90-year-old bedbound resident of a nursing home was admitted with a sacral pressure sore. Examination revealed a 10cm diameter ulcer with extensive necrotic slough and gangrenous edges extending to the coccyx. Management focused on palliative debridement and pressure relief, as the patient was not a candidate for major reconstructive surgery.

gangrene_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Neonatal gangrene of the arm
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of a cold, pale, then purple-black right arm in a newborn.
  summary_of_course: A 2-day-old neonate born via emergency C-section developed acute ischaemia of the right upper limb. Doppler ultrasound confirmed an arterial thrombosis, likely embolic from the umbilical artery catheter. Despite heparinisation, the forearm progressed to gangrene, and a surgical amputation was performed at the elbow to prevent systemic toxicity.

gangrene_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Gangrenous ischaemic colitis
  presenting_complaint: Bloody diarrhoea and severe left-sided abdominal cramping.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with congestive heart failure presented with acute colitis. Colonoscopy revealed dusky, necrotic mucosa in the splenic flexure and descending colon. He was diagnosed with gangrenous ischaemic colitis; due to signs of perforation, he underwent a left hemicolectomy and formation of an end colostomy.

gangrene_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Digital gangrene in Systemic Sclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic painful ulcers on the fingertips that have turned black.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female with limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis presented with worsening digital ischaemia. Despite maximum vasodilator therapy with bosentan and nifedipine, the tip of her right middle finger developed dry gangrene. The area was allowed to demarcate and auto-amputate to preserve as much length as possible.

gangrene_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-traumatic gangrene of the foot
  presenting_complaint: Crushed, dirty wound of the foot with worsening pain and skin darkening.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male sustained a severe crush injury at a construction site. Initial management was complicated by compartment syndrome and a missed vascular injury to the dorsalis pedis. By day 3, the midfoot showed clear signs of wet gangrene with a rising creatine kinase (CK), necessitating a Chopart's amputation.

gangrene_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Ergot-induced peripheral gangrene
  presenting_complaint: Sudden coldness and blackening of several toes after starting new medication.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female treated for refractory migraines with ergotamine tartrate presented with bilateral foot pain and cyanosis. Investigation revealed severe peripheral vasospasm (ergotism) which failed to respond to nitroprusside. She developed focal dry gangrene of the second and third toes on the left foot, highlighting a rare but severe drug-induced complication.
