alcoholic_hepatic_failure_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Alcoholic Hepatitis
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice, right upper quadrant pain, and anorexia.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented to A&E with a 2-week history of worsening icterus and abdominal discomfort following a heavy drinking binge. Investigations revealed Bilirubin 180 µmol/L, ALT 95 U/L, AST 210 U/L (AST:ALT ratio >2), and a Maddrey’s Discriminant Function of 35. He was started on nutritional support and a course of prednisolone, showing a gradual improvement in liver function over 14 days.

alcoholic_hepatic_failure_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Decompensated Alcoholic Cirrhosis with Hepatic Encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, reversal of sleep-wake cycle, and tremors.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female with a known history of alcohol misuse was brought in by family due to increasing disorientation and "flapping" tremors. Clinical examination confirmed Grade II hepatic encephalopathy and gross ascites; bloods showed ammonia 110 µmol/L and INR 1.8. She was treated with lactulose and rifaximin, alongside intravenous thiamine, resulting in a slow return to baseline mental state.

alcoholic_hepatic_failure_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic Alcoholic Hepatic Failure
  presenting_complaint: Massive haematemesis and hypotension.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with established alcoholic cirrhosis presented in hypovolaemic shock following a large variceal bleed. Despite successful endoscopic band ligation, he developed progressive jaundice and oliguria, consistent with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). He was transferred to the ICU for vasopressor support and haemofiltration but unfortunately succumbed to multi-organ failure.

alcoholic_hepatic_failure_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic Hepatic Failure with Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP)
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal distension, fever, and diffuse tenderness.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male with chronic alcohol dependence presented with a 3-day history of pyrexia and worsening abdominal swelling. Diagnostic paracentesis revealed a neutrophilic count of 450 cells/mm³, confirming SBP complicating his alcoholic liver failure. He was treated with intravenous cefotaxime and albumin infusions, leading to resolution of the infection and improvement in renal function.

alcoholic_hepatic_failure_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Alcoholic Hepatitis with Hepatorenal Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Reduced urine output and deep jaundice.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old female with a 10-year history of spirit dependency was admitted with severe icterus (Bilirubin 450 µmol/L) and anuria. Despite fluid resuscitation, her creatinine rose to 240 µmol/L with no response to diuretic withdrawal, meeting criteria for Type 1 Hepatorenal Syndrome. Terlipressin and albumin were initiated, but her prognosis remained poor due to a lack of response to medical therapy.

alcoholic_hepatic_failure_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Alcoholic Steatohepatitis
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue and incidentally discovered deranged LFTs.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male was referred from his GP after routine bloods showed GGT 450 U/L and ALT 85 U/L. Ultrasound demonstrated a bright, enlarged liver, and he admitted to consuming 60 units of alcohol weekly for five years. He was managed in the outpatient clinic with alcohol cessation counselling and nutritional advice, resulting in normalisation of LFTs within six months.

alcoholic_hepatic_failure_007:
  primary_diagnosis: End-stage Alcoholic Liver Disease with Refractory Ascites
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal tension and breathlessness.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with long-standing alcoholic cirrhosis presented for his third large-volume paracentesis in six weeks. He was on maximum doses of spironolactone and furosemide but failed to maintain fluid balance, and his MELD score was 22. He was referred for Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) evaluation as a bridge to potential transplant assessment.

alcoholic_hepatic_failure_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic Hepatic Failure with Coagulopathy
  presenting_complaint: Extensive bruising and epistaxis.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female with chronic alcohol-related liver damage presented with spontaneous ecchymoses and persistent nasal bleeding. Laboratory results showed a platelet count of 45 x 10^9/L and an INR of 2.4, indicating severe synthetic dysfunction. She received Vitamin K and prothrombin complex concentrate, and was monitored closely for intracranial haemorrhage while undergoing alcohol withdrawal management.

alcoholic_hepatic_failure_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute Alcoholic Hepatic Failure in a Young Adult
  presenting_complaint: Nausea, vomiting, and yellowing of the eyes.
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old male with a 2-year history of heavy binge drinking presented with subacute liver failure. Initial investigations showed Bilirubin 250 µmol/L and marked hypoalbuminaemia (21 g/L), with no evidence of viral or autoimmune causes. Despite aggressive nutritional support and abstinence, he developed persistent jaundice and was listed for a "super-urgent" liver transplant due to rapid clinical decline.

alcoholic_hepatic_failure_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic Hepatic Failure with Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and severe jaundice.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old homeless male was found collapsed with profound jaundice and neurological deficits. Clinical assessment confirmed acute alcoholic hepatitis superimposed on chronic failure, complicated by Wernicke’s encephalopathy. He was treated with high-dose Pabrinex and corticosteroids; while his liver function stabilized, he was left with permanent cognitive deficits and gait instability.

alcoholic_hepatic_failure_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic Hepatic Failure with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss and dull ache in the right flank.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with known alcoholic cirrhosis presented with unintentional weight loss of 10kg and worsening jaundice. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was 1200 ng/mL, and a CT scan revealed a 5cm lesion in the right lobe of the liver with arterial enhancement and venous wash-out. Given his Child-Pugh C status and hepatic failure, he was transitioned to a palliative care pathway focusing on symptom control.

alcoholic_hepatic_failure_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Alcoholic Hepatitis with Sepsis
  presenting_complaint: Rigors, hypotension, and jaundice.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old female was admitted with suspected sepsis and jaundice after a prolonged drinking period. Blood cultures grew E. coli, likely from a urinary source, which triggered a severe episode of alcoholic hepatic failure (Lille score 0.55 at day 7). She required ICU admission for vasopressors and was ineligible for steroids due to the active infection, leading to a prolonged and complicated recovery.

alcoholic_hepatic_failure_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic Hepatic Failure with Malnutrition
  presenting_complaint: Extreme weakness, muscle wasting, and peripheral oedema.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with chronic alcoholism presented with severe sarcopenia and bilateral pitting oedema to the mid-thigh. Bloods showed Albumin 18 g/L and multiple vitamin deficiencies (B12, Folate, Zinc). He was managed with a high-protein diet, thiamine, and diuretics, showing slow improvement in his synthetic liver function over several weeks of inpatient care.

alcoholic_hepatic_failure_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic Hepatic Failure with Portal Vein Thrombosis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of abdominal pain and worsening ascites.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis experienced a sudden clinical deterioration with increased abdominal girth. Doppler ultrasound confirmed a new thrombus in the portal vein, complicating his existing hepatic failure. Anticoagulation was cautiously initiated with low-molecular-weight heparin despite his variceal risk, and he was monitored for signs of intestinal ischaemia.

alcoholic_hepatic_failure_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic Hepatic Failure with Congestive Hepatopathy
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath and abdominal swelling.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with a history of both heavy alcohol use and ischaemic cardiomyopathy presented with "nutmeg liver" on imaging and biochemical evidence of failure (Bilirubin 90 µmol/L, INR 1.6). The clinical picture was a hybrid of alcoholic liver disease and congestive hepatopathy. Management involved careful diuresis and optimising his heart failure medications, though his liver reserve remained limited.

alcoholic_hepatic_failure_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic Hepatic Failure with Oesophageal Variceal Haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Melaena and dizziness.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female presented with a 2-day history of black, tarry stools and syncope. Urgent endoscopy revealed Grade III oesophageal varices with a "red wale" sign, which were successfully banded. Her post-procedure course was complicated by a rise in bilirubin and worsening coagulopathy, requiring fresh frozen plasma and intensive monitoring for hepatic coma.

alcoholic_hepatic_failure_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Alcoholic Hepatitis (Lille Score Non-responder)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive jaundice despite one week of hospitalisation.
  summary_of_course: A 47-year-old male was started on prednisolone for severe alcoholic hepatitis (Maddrey's 42). On day 7, his Lille score was calculated at 0.78, indicating a lack of response to steroids. Treatment was discontinued to prevent infectious complications, and he was managed with intensive nutritional support, though his jaundice continued to deepen.

alcoholic_hepatic_failure_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic Hepatic Failure with Hyponatraemia
  presenting_complaint: Lethargy and seizures.
  summary_of_course: A 53-year-old male with decompensated alcoholic liver disease was admitted following a generalised tonic-clonic seizure. Serum sodium was 118 mmol/L, attributed to hypervolaemic hyponatraemia from his hepatic failure and "beer potomania." He required cautious sodium correction with fluid restriction and tolvaptan to avoid osmotic demyelination syndrome, while managing his underlying liver dysfunction.

alcoholic_hepatic_failure_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic Hepatic Failure with Anaemia of Chronic Disease
  presenting_complaint: Pallor, dyspnoea on exertion, and jaundice.
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old female with chronic alcohol misuse presented with a haemoglobin of 7.2 g/dL and macrocytosis. Bone marrow biopsy showed sideroblastic changes, and liver biopsy confirmed advanced cirrhosis with active hepatitis. She received blood transfusions and was started on a comprehensive rehabilitation programme, including folic acid and thiamine supplementation.

alcoholic_hepatic_failure_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic Hepatic Failure with Hepatic Hydrothorax
  presenting_complaint: Right-sided chest pain and dry cough.
  summary_of_course: A 56-year-old male with known alcoholic cirrhosis and ascites presented with new-onset respiratory distress. A chest X-ray revealed a large right-sided pleural effusion, and thoracocentesis confirmed it was a transudate (hepatic hydrothorax). He was treated with increased doses of diuretics and a low-sodium diet, avoiding a chest drain due to the high risk of protein loss and infection.
