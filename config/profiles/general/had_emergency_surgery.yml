  primary_diagnosis: Ruptured ectopic pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset lower abdominal pain and syncope
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female was brought to A&E via ambulance after collapsing at home; she was hypotensive (BP 85/50 mmHg) with a positive pregnancy test. FAST scan revealed significant free fluid in the Pouch of Douglas, necessitating an immediate emergency laparotomy and right salpingectomy for a ruptured ampullary pregnancy. She received 3 units of packed red cells and recovered well postoperatively.

  primary_diagnosis: Obstructed inguinal hernia
  presenting_complaint: Irreducible, painful groin swelling and vomiting
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male presented with a 12-hour history of an exquisitely tender, irreducible right inguinal lump and absolute constipation. Clinical examination suggested strangulation, and he underwent emergency inguinal exploration. A loop of ischaemic but viable small bowel was reduced, and the defect was repaired with a tension-free mesh.

  primary_diagnosis: Acute testicular torsion
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset left scrotal pain and nausea
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old adolescent presented with acute, severe left-sided scrotal pain that woke him from sleep, associated with a high-riding testis and absent cremasteric reflex. He was taken to theatre within 90 minutes of arrival for emergency scrotal exploration.

had_emergency_surgery_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Necrotising fasciitis
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly spreading erythema and pain out of proportion to clinical signs
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes presented with a small wound on his left calf that rapidly became dusky and exquisitely painful. Within hours, he developed systemic sepsis and skin crepitus. He was taken for immediate radical surgical debridement of the fascia and overlying skin, requiring multiple repeat trips to theatre over the following week.

  primary_diagnosis: Large bowel obstruction secondary to sigmoid malignancy
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal distension, absolute constipation, and feculent vomiting
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old female presented with a 5-day history of worsening distension and failure to pass flatus. CT imaging showed a stenosing lesion in the sigmoid colon with proximal dilatation and a competent ileocaecal valve. She underwent an emergency Hartmann’s procedure (sigmoid colectomy and end colostomy) due to the risk of imminent caecal perforation.

had_emergency_surgery_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Cauda equina syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Lower back pain, saddle anaesthesia, and urinary retention
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old male with a history of chronic disc disease presented with acute bilateral sciatica and "numbness when wiping." Examination confirmed reduced anal tone and a bladder scan showed 800ml residual volume. Emergency MRI confirmed a massive L4/L5 disc prolapse, and he underwent an emergency lumbar decompression and discectomy within 4 hours to prevent permanent neurological deficit.

had_emergency_surgery_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Traumatic splenic rupture
  presenting_complaint: Left upper quadrant pain following a road traffic accident
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male was involved in a high-speed RTA and presented with Kehr’s sign (referred left shoulder pain). Initial CT showed a Grade IV splenic laceration with active contrast extravasation and a falling haemoglobin. Despite attempted conservative management, he became haemodynamically unstable and underwent an emergency splenectomy.

had_emergency_surgery_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute cholecystitis with empyema
  presenting_complaint: Right upper quadrant pain, fever, and Murphy's sign positivity
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with a BMI of 34 presented with severe RUQ pain and a temperature of 39.2°C. Ultrasound showed a distended gallbladder with thickened walls and pericholecystic fluid. During emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the gallbladder was found to be gangrenous and filled with pus, requiring conversion to an open procedure for safe dissection.

had_emergency_surgery_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute mesenteric ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal pain out of proportion to physical findings
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male with atrial fibrillation presented with sudden, generalised abdominal agony but a soft abdomen on palpation. Blood gas showed a metabolic acidosis with lactate of 6.2 mmol/L. CT angiography confirmed an arterial embolus in the superior mesenteric artery, and he underwent emergency laparotomy for embolectomy and resection of 50cm of necrotic jejunum.

had_emergency_surgery_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Obstructed labour (Cephalopelvic disproportion)
  presenting_complaint: Failure to progress in the second stage of labour
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old primiparous woman had been in active labour for 14 hours with no further cervical dilatation despite oxytocin augmentation. Fetal bradycardia was noted on CTG, and she was rushed to theatre for a Category 1 emergency Caesarean section. A healthy 4.2kg infant was delivered, though the mother required treatment for a primary postpartum haemorrhage of 1.2 litres.

had_emergency_surgery_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Extradural haematoma
  presenting_complaint: Head injury followed by a "lucid interval" and subsequent GCS drop
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male fell from a skateboard, initially appearing fine before becoming drowsy and developing a blown right pupil. CT head showed a biconvex, hyperdense collection consistent with a temporal extradural haematoma. He underwent an emergency craniotomy and evacuation of the clot, resulting in a full neurological recovery.

had_emergency_surgery_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute limb ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Cold, pulseless, and painful right leg
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old smoker presented with a 4-hour history of the "6 Ps" in his right lower limb. On examination, the leg was pale and cold to the touch with no audible Doppler signals. He was taken for emergency femoral embolectomy using a Fogarty catheter, which successfully restored distal perfusion, followed by a fasciotomy to prevent compartment syndrome.

had_emergency_surgery_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Perianal abscess with Fournier’s gangrene
  presenting_complaint: Perineal pain, swelling, and systemic upset
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male with poorly managed type 2 diabetes presented with what appeared to be a simple perianal abscess, but examination under anaesthesia revealed extensive subcutaneous necrosis extending to the scrotum. He underwent wide surgical debridement of the perineum and was started on broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics for Fournier's gangrene.

had_emergency_surgery_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Intussusception
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent colicky pain and "redcurrant jelly" stools
  summary_of_course: A 10-month-old infant presented with bouts of inconsolable crying and drawing up of the legs. After an unsuccessful attempt at ultrasound-guided air enema reduction, the child was taken for emergency laparotomy. The ileocolic intussusception was manually reduced, and a small area of serosal tearing was repaired.

had_emergency_surgery_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Sigmoid volvulus
  presenting_complaint: Massive abdominal distension and inability to pass flatus
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old nursing home resident with chronic constipation presented with a "coffee bean" sign on abdominal X-ray. Initial rigid sigmoidoscopy and flatus tube insertion failed to detort the bowel. He underwent an emergency laparotomy and Paul-Mikulicz procedure due to evidence of sigmoid gangrene.

had_emergency_surgery_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Open tibial fracture (Gustilo-Anderson IIIb)
  presenting_complaint: Deformity and bone protrusion following a fall from height
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old construction worker sustained an open mid-shaft tibial fracture with significant soft tissue loss. Following initial stabilisation, he was taken to theatre for emergency wound debridement, washout, and application of an external fixator. He required subsequent plastic surgery involvement for a free flap reconstruction.

had_emergency_surgery_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute limb-threatening compartment syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Severe calf pain exacerbated by passive stretch
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old female sustained a closed tibial plateau fracture during a skiing accident. Six hours post-injury, she developed escalating pain despite opioid analgesia and paraesthesia in the first web space. Intracompartmental pressure monitoring showed a delta pressure of 15 mmHg, necessitating immediate emergency four-compartment fasciotomies of the lower leg.
