  presenting_complaint: Blue discolouration of toes during outdoor PE lessons.
  summary_of_course: An 11-year-old girl is brought to the paediatric clinic by her parents concerned about her toes turning blue in winter. Clinical history reveals no systemic features of connective tissue disease and normal inflammatory markers. Reassured as primary Raynaud's and advised on layering clothing and using toe warmers.

raynauds_disease_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Beta-blocker induced Raynaud's phenomenon
  presenting_complaint: New onset of cold, painful hands since starting heart medication.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with a recent myocardial infarction was started on Propranolol. He subsequently developed significant vasospastic episodes in both hands.

raynauds_disease_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Chemotherapy-induced Raynaud's phenomenon
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of Raynaud's symptoms following cancer treatment.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male undergoing cisplatin-based chemotherapy for testicular cancer develops severe vasospasm in his fingers. The symptoms persist post-treatment, requiring management with Sildenafil. This is a recognised late toxicity of platinum-based agents.

raynauds_disease_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Paraneoplastic Raynaud's phenomenon
  presenting_complaint: Late-onset, severe Raynaud's in an elderly smoker.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male smoker presents with a 3-month history of aggressive Raynaud's symptoms and weight loss. Given the late onset and male gender, a malignancy screen was performed. CT chest revealed a suspicious hilar mass, later confirmed as small cell lung carcinoma.

raynauds_disease_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Raynaud's phenomenon with secondary infection
  presenting_complaint: Swollen, red, and painful finger following a Raynaud's attack.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with chronic Raynaud's developed a small fissure on her thumb which became erythematous and purulent. Diagnosed with infected digital ulceration/cellulitis. Treated with a 2-week course of Flucloxacillin and optimization of her vasodilator therapy.

raynauds_disease_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary Raynaud's associated with Sjögren's Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Dry eyes, dry mouth, and cold-sensitive hands.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female with a 5-year history of sicca symptoms presents with worsening episodes of her fingers turning white and painful. Schirmer's test is positive, and anti-Ro/SSA antibodies are detected. Raynaud's is managed conservatively alongside her Sjögren's treatment.

raynauds_disease_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary Raynaud's in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Management of Raynaud's symptoms during first trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old pregnant woman with pre-existing mild Raynaud's seeks advice on medication. Her Nifedipine was discontinued due to pregnancy concerns. Managed successfully with non-pharmacological measures, noting that Raynaud's often improves in the second and third trimesters due to increased blood volume.

raynauds_disease_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Raynaud's phenomenon
  presenting_complaint: Persistent symptoms despite multiple oral medications.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female with severe idiopathic Raynaud's failed to respond to Nifedipine, Losartan, and Sildenafil. She underwent Botulinum toxin type A injections into the neurovascular bundles of the palms. This resulted in a significant reduction in the frequency and severity of vasospastic attacks for six months.

raynauds_disease_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary Raynaud's associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Symmetrical hand pain and morning stiffness with cold sensitivity.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female with established RA presents with new-onset Raynaud's. Examination shows ulnar deviation and synovitis of the MCP joints. Inflammatory markers are elevated.

  primary_diagnosis: Unilateral Raynaud's phenomenon (Atypical)
  presenting_complaint: Raynaud's symptoms affecting only the right hand.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male presents with vasospasm isolated to his right hand. Due to the asymmetry, a cervical rib or proximal embolic source was suspected. Imaging revealed a cervical rib causing thoracic outlet syndrome, necessitating surgical decompression rather than standard Raynaud's medical therapy.

  primary_diagnosis: Cryoglobulinaemia-associated Raynaud's
  presenting_complaint: Cold-induced skin changes and palpable purpura.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old female with chronic Hepatitis C presents with Raynaud's and a petechial rash on her legs. Laboratory tests show low C4 levels and positive serum cryoglobulins. Raynaud's is managed as part of the systemic vasculitis treatment, including antiviral therapy for Hepatitis C.

raynauds_disease_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary Raynaud's in Dermatomyositis
  presenting_complaint: Weakness, skin rash, and painful fingers.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female presents with proximal muscle weakness, Gottron's papules, and severe Raynaud's. Nailfold capillaroscopy shows significant dropout and "bushy" capillaries. Diagnosed with Dermatomyositis; Raynaud's symptoms are treated with Diltiazem while systemic steroids address the underlying myositis.

  presenting_complaint: Acrocyanosis and fatigue.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male presents with Raynaud's-like symptoms and dark urine in the morning. Blood film shows red cell agglutination and a direct antiglobulin test (DAT) is positive for C3d. Diagnosed with Cold Agglutinin Disease; symptoms are driven by cold-induced haemolysis rather than simple vasospasm.

  primary_diagnosis: Buerger's Disease (Thromboangiitis Obliterans)
  presenting_complaint: Finger discolouration and calf pain when walking.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male heavy smoker presents with Raynaud's symptoms and intermittent claudication. Angiography shows "corkscrew" collaterals and distal arterial occlusions. Diagnosed with Buerger's disease; the primary management focus is absolute smoking cessation to prevent limb loss.

raynauds_disease_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Scleroderma Renal Crisis with Raynaud's
  presenting_complaint: Severe headache, blurred vision, and cold digits.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis and severe Raynaud's presents to the ICU with malignant hypertension (210/120 mmHg) and acute kidney injury. This life-threatening complication required urgent ACE inhibitor therapy. Raynaud's management was secondary to stabilising her renal function and blood pressure.
