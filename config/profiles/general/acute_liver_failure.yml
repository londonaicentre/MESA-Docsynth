  primary_diagnosis: Amanita Phalloides (Mushroom) Poisoning
  presenting_complaint: Delayed onset of severe diarrhoea and vomiting after foraging.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male presented 24 hours after consuming wild mushrooms with gastrointestinal distress followed by a "latent period." On day 3, his ALT peaked at 8000 U/L with an INR of 5.2. He was treated with intravenous silibinin and NAC, eventually avoiding a transplant as his synthetic function slowly improved.

acute_liver_failure_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Ischaemic Hepatitis (Shock Liver)
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes following a cardiac arrest.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female was admitted to ICU post-resuscitation for an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Routine labs showed ALT rising from 40 to 4500 U/L within 24 hours, alongside an elevated LDH. The liver injury was managed conservatively with haemodynamic optimization, and enzymes rapidly declined as cardiac output stabilized.

  primary_diagnosis: Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) due to Herbal Supplements
  presenting_complaint: Progressive jaundice and pruritus after starting "fat-burner" pills.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female presented with a 2-week history of worsening icterus and lethargy. Biopsy confirmed severe drug-induced hepatitis with bridging necrosis attributed to green tea extract supplements. She required a short course of corticosteroids and close outpatient monitoring as her bilirubin peaked at 450 µmol/L before resolving.

  primary_diagnosis: Acute Autoimmune Hepatitis
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue, arthralgia, and jaundice in a young woman.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female presented with an acute-on-chronic picture, though no prior diagnosis existed. Labs showed IgG of 32 g/L and positive anti-smooth muscle antibodies. She responded dramatically to high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone, avoiding the need for liver transplantation.

acute_liver_failure_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Budd-Chiari Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of painful ascites and hepatomegaly.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female on the oral contraceptive pill presented with acute right upper quadrant pain and abdominal distension. Doppler ultrasound revealed complete thrombosis of the hepatic veins. She underwent emergency transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement to decompress the liver and prevent further necrosis.

acute_liver_failure_011:
  primary_diagnosis: MDMA-Induced Hyperthermic Liver Failure
  presenting_complaint: Hyperpyrexia, seizures, and subsequent jaundice after a music festival.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male presented with a core temperature of 41°C and multi-organ dysfunction following MDMA use. He developed profound coagulopathy and Grade 2 encephalopathy within 48 hours. Management involved aggressive cooling, NAC infusion, and ICU monitoring, with gradual hepatic regeneration over two weeks.

acute_liver_failure_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Valproate-Induced Hepatotoxicity (Paediatric)
  presenting_complaint: Lethargy and vomiting in a child with refractory epilepsy.
  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old girl on sodium valproate presented with acute metabolic acidosis and hyperammonaemia. Investigations showed microvesicular steatosis and severely elevated transaminases. Despite L-carnitine supplementation, she progressed to liver failure and required emergency stabilization for transfer to a paediatric liver unit.

acute_liver_failure_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Malignant Infiltration of the Liver
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly enlarging liver, weight loss, and jaundice.
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male with a history of breast cancer presented with acute liver failure symptoms. Imaging showed massive hepatomegaly with diffuse infiltration rather than discrete nodules. Biopsy confirmed metastatic infiltration, and the patient was transitioned to palliative care due to the poor prognosis of malignant ALF.

acute_liver_failure_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Hepatitis
  presenting_complaint: Fever and markedly elevated transaminases in an immunocompromised patient.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male on immunosuppression for a renal transplant presented with a "fever of unknown origin" and ALT > 10,000 U/L but relatively low bilirubin. HSV PCR was positive, and he was treated with high-dose intravenous aciclovir. Despite treatment, he developed fulminant failure and died before a transplant could be considered.

acute_liver_failure_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Staggered Paracetamol Overdose
  presenting_complaint: Persistent abdominal pain and mild confusion after taking extra paracetamol for toothache.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male ingested 10g of paracetamol daily for four days. He presented with an INR of 2.5 and ALT of 3200 U/L. Because the ingestion was staggered, he was at high risk for liver failure despite "non-toxic" single-point levels; he required a prolonged course of NAC and close monitoring of renal function.

acute_liver_failure_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis A (Severe Paediatric Case)
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice, vomiting, and altered mental status in a 7-year-old.
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old boy presented with acute icterus following a school outbreak. He rapidly became drowsy (Grade 2 encephalopathy) with an INR of 3.2. He was managed in a specialist unit with supportive care; his liver function began to improve spontaneously on day 5 without the need for transplantation.

acute_liver_failure_017:
  primary_diagnosis: HELLP Syndrome with Hepatic Rupture
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, severe epigastric pain and hypotension in a pregnant patient.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old female with pre-eclampsia developed Haemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelets (HELLP). A CT scan revealed a large subcapsular hepatic haematoma that had ruptured. She underwent emergency laparotomy for packing and a Caesarean section, requiring massive transfusion and ICU support.

acute_liver_failure_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF)
  presenting_complaint: Worsening ascites and confusion in a patient with known alcoholic cirrhosis.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with stable cirrhosis presented with sepsis from a urinary tract infection. This triggered a massive systemic inflammatory response, leading to Grade 3 ACLF with renal and respiratory failure. Despite intensive care and antibiotics, the patient did not recover and was not a candidate for transplantation.

acute_liver_failure_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Amoxicillin-Clavulanate Induced DILI
  presenting_complaint: Delayed jaundice and itching three weeks after finishing antibiotics.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male presented with a cholestatic pattern of liver injury (ALP 800 U/L, Bilirubin 300 µmol/L). While initially appearing like a bile duct obstruction, MRCP was clear, and history confirmed recent Co-amoxiclav use. His condition was managed with ursodeoxycholic acid and supportive care, with slow resolution over three months.

acute_liver_failure_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis E in an Elderly Patient
  presenting_complaint: Profound jaundice and anorexia in a 75-year-old male.
  summary_of_course: An elderly male with pre-existing mild fatty liver presented with subacute liver failure. HEV IgM was positive, likely acquired from undercooked pork. He developed worsening coagulopathy and encephalopathy, but was successfully treated with a course of ribavirin and supportive ICU care.
