central_pontine_myelinolysis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Central pontine myelinolysis
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset dysarthria and dysphagia following hyponatraemia correction
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with chronic alcohol dependence presented with a serum sodium of 112 mmol/L. Following rapid correction to 130 mmol/L within 24 hours, he developed progressive "hot potato" speech and difficulty swallowing. MRI brain revealed classic T2-hyperintensity in the central pons sparing the periphery, confirming CPM. He was managed with supportive care and intensive speech and language therapy, showing partial recovery at six months.

central_pontine_myelinolysis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Central pontine myelinolysis with locked-in syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Complete paralysis except for vertical eye movements
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female with severe hyperemesis gravidarum was admitted with profound electrolyte derangement (Na+ 108 mmol/L). Rapid replacement led to acute tetraplegia and pseudobulbar palsy within 4 days. MRI confirmed extensive pontine demyelination; she remains in a locked-in state in the ICU. Treatment involves long-term ventilatory support and multidisciplinary rehabilitation.

central_pontine_myelinolysis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute central pontine myelinolysis
  presenting_complaint: Subacute gait instability and cognitive slowing
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female on Indapamide for hypertension presented with a two-week history of confusion and falls. Serum sodium was 118 mmol/L on admission and was corrected gradually, yet she developed worsening ataxia. MRI demonstrated a small area of central pontine myelinolysis despite cautious fluid management. She was transitioned to a neuro-rehabilitation unit for gait training and cognitive support.

central_pontine_myelinolysis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-transplant central pontine myelinolysis
  presenting_complaint: Acute mutism and reduced Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) post-liver transplant
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male underwent orthotopic liver transplantation for NASH cirrhosis. Post-operatively, he experienced significant fluctuations in serum sodium levels due to large volume fluid shifts. On day 5, he became non-verbal and developed spastic quadriparesis. MRI Brain confirmed CPM; despite methylprednisolone pulses, he had a poor neurological outcome and was transferred to long-term nursing care.

central_pontine_myelinolysis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric central pontine myelinolysis
  presenting_complaint: Lethargy and new-onset tremors during refeeding
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old girl with severe anorexia nervosa (BMI 12.5) was admitted for refeeding. During the correction of severe malnutrition and associated hyponatraemia, she developed acute limb tremors and emotional lability. MRI showed a characteristic trident-shaped lesion in the pons. She was managed with a slowed refeeding protocol and intravenous thiamine, with near-complete resolution of symptoms over three months.

central_pontine_myelinolysis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic incidental central pontine myelinolysis
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding on MRI for persistent headaches
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male with a history of chronic hyponatraemia (baseline Na+ 125-128 mmol/L) secondary to SIADH underwent MRI for unrelated migraines. Imaging revealed a well-circumscribed area of chronic T2-hyperintensity in the central pons consistent with old CPM. Retrospective history suggested a period of "flu-like illness" and mild clumsiness two years prior that was never investigated. No active treatment was required other than headache management.

central_pontine_myelinolysis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Central pontine and extrapontine myelinolysis
  presenting_complaint: Acute parkinsonism and dystonia
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old female with psychogenic polydipsia presented with water intoxication (Na+ 105 mmol/L). Following rapid correction in A&E, she developed bradykinesia, rigidity, and focal dystonia of the right hand. MRI showed signal changes in both the central pons and the basal ganglia (extrapontine myelinolysis). She was treated with Levodopa for symptomatic relief of parkinsonian features with moderate success.

central_pontine_myelinolysis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe central pontine myelinolysis
  presenting_complaint: Failure to wean from mechanical ventilation in ICU
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female was admitted to ICU with urosepsis and severe hyponatraemia. After initial stabilisation and sodium correction, she failed multiple spontaneous breathing trials despite resolved sepsis. Neurological examination revealed absent gag reflex and quadriparesis. MRI confirmed extensive pontine demyelination; she subsequently underwent a tracheostomy for long-term ventilatory weaning.

central_pontine_myelinolysis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Central pontine myelinolysis (delayed MRI findings)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive limb weakness and dysarthria
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with alcohol-related liver disease had rapid Na+ correction (115 to 135 mmol/L in 18h). Initial MRI on day 2 of symptoms was unremarkable. Due to clinical progression of quadriparesis, a repeat MRI on day 10 showed the classic "trident" pontine lesion. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge of early-stage CPM where imaging may lag behind clinical signs.

central_pontine_myelinolysis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Central pontine myelinolysis following failed re-lowering
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly worsening neurological deficit despite intervention
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old male had his sodium corrected from 110 to 132 mmol/L in 12 hours. Upon recognising the over-correction, clinicians attempted to re-lower the sodium using 5% Dextrose and Desmopressin (DDAVP). Despite these efforts, the patient developed dense tetraparesis 72 hours later. MRI confirmed CPM, and the patient was left with significant permanent motor disability.

central_pontine_myelinolysis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Central pontine myelinolysis in a burn patient
  presenting_complaint: Acute confusion and pseudobulbar palsy
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old male with 40% Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) burns experienced massive fluid shifts and electrolyte disturbances during the resuscitative phase. On day 6, he developed acute confusion and an inability to protect his airway. MRI Brain showed central pontine myelinolysis, likely triggered by rapid shifts in serum osmolality. He required prolonged ICU stay and extensive physical rehabilitation.

central_pontine_myelinolysis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild central pontine myelinolysis
  presenting_complaint: Mild dysarthria and gait ataxia
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with small cell lung cancer and associated SIADH was treated for hyponatraemia. Sodium rose by 14 mmol/L in 24 hours, after which he noted slight slurring of speech and unsteadiness. MRI confirmed a small focal area of pontine demyelination. Symptoms were mild and did not progress; he was managed conservatively with close monitoring of his electrolytes during chemotherapy.

central_pontine_myelinolysis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic central pontine myelinolysis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of pre-existing balance issues and new dysphagia
  summary_of_course: A 56-year-old female with chronic alcoholic cerebellar degeneration and baseline low sodium presented with acute viral gastroenteritis. Dehydration led to a rapid rise in serum sodium from 122 to 142 mmol/L. She developed acute dysphagia and increased limb spasticity. MRI showed new-onset central pontine myelinolysis superimposed on chronic cerebellar atrophy. She required a PEG tube for long-term nutritional support.

central_pontine_myelinolysis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Central pontine myelinolysis (Community-acquired)
  presenting_complaint: Found collapsed with profound weakness and mutism
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male living in social isolation was found by neighbours. On admission, he was hyponatraemic (108 mmol/L) and dehydrated; his sodium auto-corrected rapidly with simple IV saline. Within 48 hours, he became mute and quadriplegic. MRI confirmed severe CPM; the case was complicated by malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies, requiring high-dose thiamine and intensive physiotherapy.

central_pontine_myelinolysis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Central pontine myelinolysis in ESRD
  presenting_complaint: Ataxia and diplopia following haemodialysis
  summary_of_course: A 53-year-old female with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) missed three dialysis sessions and presented with fluid overload and a sodium of 120 mmol/L. Following an intensive dialysis session, her sodium and urea levels dropped/shifted rapidly. She developed acute ataxia and double vision. MRI confirmed a pontine lesion; symptoms partially resolved after adjusting her dialysis prescription and providing supportive care.

central_pontine_myelinolysis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Central pontine myelinolysis and Wernicke's encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and tetraparesis
  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old female post-bariatric surgery presented with persistent vomiting and weight loss. She was found to have a sodium of 115 mmol/L and was rapidly corrected. She developed a complex neurological picture with ataxia, nystagmus, and limb weakness. MRI showed both mammillary body enhancement (Wernicke's) and central pontine T2-prolongation (CPM). She was treated with high-dose IV Pabrinex and slow sodium management, with slow but steady improvement.

central_pontine_myelinolysis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Central pontine myelinolysis in Addisonian crisis
  presenting_complaint: Lethargy and progressive weakness after crisis management
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with known Addison's disease presented in adrenal crisis with Na+ 112 mmol/L. Aggressive hydrocortisone and saline resuscitation resulted in a sodium rise of 18 mmol/L in 15 hours. He subsequently developed profound lethargy and proximal muscle weakness. MRI confirmed CPM; he was managed with steroid optimisation and intensive rehabilitation, achieving independent ambulation after four months.

central_pontine_myelinolysis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Central pontine myelinolysis (Psychiatric setting)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden mutism in a patient with schizophrenia
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male with schizophrenia and known psychogenic polydipsia was admitted to a psychiatric ward. He developed water intoxication (Na+ 110 mmol/L) and was transferred to the medical take, where sodium was corrected to 130 mmol/L in 20 hours. He became mute and developed a "pseudobulbar affect" (inappropriate crying). MRI confirmed CPM; he required a transition to a neuropsychiatric unit for integrated care.

central_pontine_myelinolysis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate central pontine myelinolysis
  presenting_complaint: Weakness in all four limbs and slurred speech
  summary_of_course: A 49-year-old female abusing Chlortalidone for weight loss presented with a sodium of 114 mmol/L. Rapid correction led to moderate quadriparesis and dysarthria over 72 hours. MRI showed a classic central pontine lesion. She underwent three months of inpatient neuro-rehabilitation and was able to walk with a frame at discharge, though dysarthria persisted.

central_pontine_myelinolysis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic central pontine myelinolysis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent vertigo and mild cognitive impairment
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old female was investigated for chronic dizziness. MRI Brain showed an old area of gliosis in the central pons. Detailed history revealed a hospitalisation 5 years prior for "severe salt imbalance" following pneumonia, which was not followed up neurologically. Her current symptoms were attributed to a combination of the old CPM lesion and age-related vestibular dysfunction. No acute intervention was indicated.
