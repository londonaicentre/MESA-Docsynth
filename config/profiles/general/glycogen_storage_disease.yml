Muscle biopsy confirmed absence of myophosphorylase; patient was educated on the "second wind" phenomenon and high-protein diet.

glycogen_storage_disease_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Glycogen Storage Disease Type IIIa (Cori/Forbes Disease)
  presenting_complaint: Hepatomegaly and progressive muscle weakness.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old girl with known childhood hepatomegaly presented with new-onset proximal limb-girdle weakness. Investigations demonstrated elevated transaminases and CK, with echocardiography showing mild ventricular hypertrophy. Genetic testing identified mutations in the AGL gene affecting both liver and muscle debranching enzymes; management shifted to a high-protein, cornstarch-supported regimen.

glycogen_storage_disease_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Glycogen Storage Disease Type IV (Andersen Disease)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive jaundice and abdominal swelling.
  summary_of_course: A 14-month-old male presented with failure to thrive and hepatosplenomegaly. Liver biopsy revealed PAS-positive, diastase-resistant deposits (amylopectin-like molecules) and bridging fibrosis. The patient progressed rapidly to liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension, necessitating referral for orthotopic liver transplantation.

glycogen_storage_disease_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Glycogen Storage Disease Type Ib
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent bacterial infections and oral ulceration.
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old boy with known GSD I presented with persistent neutropenia and painful aphthous ulcers.

  primary_diagnosis: Glycogen Storage Disease Type II (Late-onset Pompe Disease)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive walking difficulties and morning headaches.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented with difficulty climbing stairs and obstructive sleep apnoea. Pulmonary function tests showed a significant drop in forced vital capacity (FVC) when supine. Dried blood spot testing confirmed low acid alpha-glucosidase activity, and she was commenced on fortnightly ERT infusions with stabilisation of her motor function.

glycogen_storage_disease_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Glycogen Storage Disease Type VI (Hers Disease)
  presenting_complaint: Incidental hepatomegaly and mild growth retardation.
  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old male was referred after a GP noted a palpable liver edge 4cm below the costal margin during a routine check-up. He had mild ketotic hypoglycaemia during an intercurrent viral illness but was otherwise asymptomatic. Genetic testing confirmed a mutation in the PYGL gene; the prognosis is excellent, with liver size typically normalising during puberty.

glycogen_storage_disease_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Glycogen Storage Disease Type IXa
  presenting_complaint: Short stature and enlarged abdomen.
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old boy presented with height below the 3rd centile and significant hepatomegaly. Laboratory findings showed elevated triglycerides and transaminases, but normal lactate levels. Sequencing of the PHKA2 gene confirmed X-linked phosphorylase kinase deficiency; symptoms were managed with a high-carbohydrate diet and avoidance of prolonged fasting.

glycogen_storage_disease_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Glycogen Storage Disease Type VII (Tarui Disease)
  presenting_complaint: Exercise intolerance and haemolytic anaemia.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male presented with myogenic hyperuricaemia and jaundice following vigorous exertion. Unlike McArdle disease, his symptoms were exacerbated by high-carbohydrate meals (out-of-wind phenomenon). Phosphofructokinase deficiency was confirmed via muscle biopsy, and he was advised on a ketogenic-style diet to provide alternative fuel sources for muscles.

glycogen_storage_disease_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Glycogen Storage Disease Type 0 (Liver Glycogen Synthase Deficiency)
  presenting_complaint: Early morning lethargy and post-prandial hyperglycaemia.
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old girl presented with recurrent episodes of morning fatigue and ketonuria. Interestingly, her blood glucose rose significantly after meals, often reaching diabetic ranges, while fasting levels were low. Genetic testing for GYS2 confirmed GSD 0; management involved frequent protein-rich meals and evening cornstarch to prevent nocturnal ketosis.

glycogen_storage_disease_012:

  presenting_complaint: Severe muscle pain and oliguria.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female with known McArdle disease was admitted to the ICU following an intense CrossFit session. She developed severe rhabdomyolysis with a peak CK of 120,000 U/L and acute kidney injury (AKI). She required urgent haemodialysis and aggressive intravenous hydration before renal function eventually recovered over three weeks.

glycogen_storage_disease_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Glycogen Storage Disease Type Ib (SGLT2 Inhibitor Therapy)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic oral candidiasis and refractory neutropenia.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old girl with GSD Ib remained symptomatic despite high-dose G-CSF, suffering from painful bowel inflammation. She was started on Empagliflozin (off-label) to reduce 1,5-anhydroglucitol levels, which improved her neutrophil count and allowed for a reduction in G-CSF dosing. Her oral ulcers and gastrointestinal symptoms showed significant clinical improvement within months.

glycogen_storage_disease_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Glycogen Storage Disease Type II (CRIM-negative Infantile Pompe)
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive heart failure.
  summary_of_course: A 2-month-old male was identified as Cross-Reactive Immunologic Material (CRIM) negative. To prevent the development of high-titre antibodies against ERT, an immune tolerance induction (ITI) protocol using Rituximab and Methotrexate was initiated alongside Alglucosidase alfa. Despite aggressive management, the patient experienced significant developmental delay but maintained stable cardiac function.

glycogen_storage_disease_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Glycogen Storage Disease Type IXb
  presenting_complaint: Hepatomegaly and elevated liver enzymes.
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old female presented with persistent transaminitis discovered during workup for abdominal pain. Genetic testing confirmed a mutation in the PHKG2 gene, which typically presents with a more severe phenotype than the X-linked form. She required nocturnal gastric drip feeding to maintain euglycaemia and support normal growth velocity.

glycogen_storage_disease_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Glycogen Storage Disease Type Ia (Pregnancy Management)
  presenting_complaint: Management of labour in a patient with GSD Ia.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old pregnant female with GSD Ia was managed by a multidisciplinary team. During labour, she required a continuous intravenous dextrose infusion (10%) to prevent hypoglycaemia and lactic acidosis. Post-partum, she was closely monitored for haemorrhage due to her known platelet dysfunction, and her cornstarch requirements were adjusted for breastfeeding.
