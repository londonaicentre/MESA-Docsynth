  presenting_complaint: Severe, progressive headache and nausea.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female, six weeks postpartum, presented to A&E with a worsening "pressure-like" headache. Examination showed bilateral grade 3 papilloedema and a partial sixth nerve palsy. MRV confirmed thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus, and she was started on therapeutic anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin.

papilloedema_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Malignant Hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Blurred vision and confusion.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with poorly controlled essential hypertension was admitted with a blood pressure of 230/130 mmHg.

  primary_diagnosis: Posterior Fossa Tumour (Medulloblastoma)
  presenting_complaint: Morning vomiting and gait ataxia.
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old boy presented with a three-week history of early morning emesis and increasing clumsiness. Clinical exam revealed gross bilateral papilloedema and truncal ataxia. Urgent MRI identified a large midline cerebellar mass causing obstructive hydrocephalus, requiring emergency EVD insertion and subsequent resection.

  primary_diagnosis: Tetracycline-induced Pseudotumour Cerebri
  presenting_complaint: Frontal headache and retro-orbital pain.
  summary_of_course: A 17-year-old male recently started on minocycline for acne vulgaris presented with subacute headaches. Ophthalmoscopy showed mild bilateral disc margin blurring and loss of spontaneous venous pulsations. The medication was discontinued, and symptoms resolved within four weeks without further intervention.

  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) with Hypercapnia
  presenting_complaint: Drowsiness and early morning headaches.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old smoker with severe COPD presented with Type 2 respiratory failure. Physical examination noted bilateral papilloedema, thought to be secondary to hypercapnia-induced cerebral vasodilation. His intracranial pressure normalised following the initiation of Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) and improvement in pCO2 levels.

papilloedema_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Craniosynostosis (Apert Syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Routine ophthalmic screening for syndromic child.
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old girl with Apert syndrome underwent routine surveillance which identified asymptomatic, chronic grade 1 papilloedema. Further neuroimaging and ICP bolt monitoring confirmed borderline intracranial hypertension due to restricted cranial volume. She was scheduled for a planned cranial vault expansion surgery.

papilloedema_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Space-Occupying Lesion (Glioblastoma Multiforme)
  presenting_complaint: New-onset seizure and left-sided weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female presented to the emergency department after a generalised tonic-clonic seizure. Examination showed dense right-sided papilloedema and subtle left hemiparesis. MRI Brain revealed a large necrotic mass in the right frontal lobe with significant midline shift, necessitating urgent dexamethasone and neurosurgical referral.

papilloedema_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Pseudopapilloedema (Optic Disc Drusen)
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding during routine optician check.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy was referred for "swollen discs" found during a school vision screening. He was asymptomatic with no headaches or visual obscurations. B-scan ultrasonography and autofluorescence imaging confirmed the presence of buried optic disc drusen, ruling out true papilloedema.

papilloedema_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) Shunt Malfunction
  presenting_complaint: Lethargy and "sunsetting" eye sign.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old with a history of congenital hydrocephalus presented with acute-on-chronic headache and decreased Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Fundoscopy showed florid bilateral papilloedema. A shunt series and CT brain confirmed proximal catheter blockage, and he underwent emergency shunt revision.

papilloedema_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Vitamin A Toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Skin peeling and persistent headache.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old "health enthusiast" presented with chronic headaches and blurred vision after consuming high-dose retinol supplements (100,000 IU/day) for six months. Examination confirmed bilateral papilloedema. Serum retinol levels were significantly elevated; symptoms and disc swelling regressed three months after ceasing the supplements.

papilloedema_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Foster Kennedy Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Unilateral vision loss and anosmia.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male presented with progressive vision loss in the left eye and loss of smell. Examination revealed optic atrophy in the left eye and papilloedema in the right eye. Imaging confirmed a large olfactory groove meningioma compressing the left optic nerve and causing raised ICP, resulting in contralateral disc swelling.

papilloedema_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Fulminant Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive vision loss over 48 hours.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female with a high BMI presented with severe headache and rapidly constricting visual fields. Fundoscopy showed grade 5 papilloedema with macular star formation. Due to the high risk of permanent blindness, she underwent an emergency lumboperitoneal shunt after failing to respond to high-dose intravenous acetazolamide.

papilloedema_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Anaemia-associated Intracranial Hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue and pulsatile tinnitus.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female with menorrhagia presented with symptoms of raised ICP. Laboratory tests showed a haemoglobin of 52 g/L (profound iron deficiency anaemia). Fundoscopy revealed bilateral papilloedema, which resolved completely following blood transfusion and iron supplementation, without needing long-term diuretics.

papilloedema_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Obstructive Hydrocephalus (Aqueductal Stenosis)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic dull headache and difficulty looking up.
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old male presented with a long history of mild headaches and recent Parinaud’s syndrome (upgaze palsy). Clinical examination showed chronic, pale papilloedema. MRI confirmed late-onset aqueductal stenosis, and he was successfully treated with an endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV).

papilloedema_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) with Neuropsychiatric involvement
  presenting_complaint: Headache and malar rash.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female with SLE presented with worsening headaches and visual blurring. Investigations showed raised opening pressure on LP and bilateral papilloedema, but no evidence of venous thrombosis on MRV. The condition was diagnosed as IIH secondary to SLE-related small vessel vasculitis and responded to increased immunosuppression and diuretics.

papilloedema_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Subarachnoid Haemorrhage (SAH) with Terson Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Sudden "thunderclap" headache.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male collapsed with a sudden onset severe headache. In the ICU, fundoscopy revealed bilateral papilloedema and preretinal haemorrhages (Terson syndrome). CT confirmed a ruptured berry aneurysm; the papilloedema was a marker of the acute rise in ICP following the haemorrhage.

papilloedema_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Addison's Disease (Adrenal Insufficiency)
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss, hyperpigmentation, and headache.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented with systemic unwellness and new-onset headaches. Examination showed bilateral papilloedema and postural hypotension. Biochemistry confirmed primary adrenal insufficiency; the raised ICP was attributed to electrolyte imbalances and cerebral oedema, resolving with corticosteroid replacement.

papilloedema_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic IIH with Optic Atrophy
  presenting_complaint: Persistent peripheral vision loss.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female with a 10-year history of IIH and poor compliance with acetazolamide presented for review. Fundoscopy showed "flat" but pale optic discs, representing secondary optic atrophy following chronic papilloedema. Perimetry demonstrated severe constricted visual fields (tunnel vision), indicating irreversible neural damage despite now-normalised ICP.
