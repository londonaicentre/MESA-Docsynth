  presenting_complaint: Reversal of sleep-wake cycle and asterixis
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old female with cryptogenic cirrhosis was brought to the A&E by her family due to increasing forgetfulness and "flapping" hands. She was diagnosed with Grade II hepatic encephalopathy likely precipitated by constipation. Management included regular lactulose and rifaximin, resulting in significant cognitive improvement.

chronic_liver_failure_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Ascites
  presenting_complaint: Tense, painful abdominal distension
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with end-stage liver failure secondary to ARLD presented with ascites that no longer responded to maximum doses of diuretics. He required large-volume paracentesis (LVP) every two weeks with albumin cover. He is currently being evaluated for a Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS).
