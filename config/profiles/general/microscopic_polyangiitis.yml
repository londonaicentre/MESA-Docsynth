He was treated in the outpatient setting with oral prednisolone and methotrexate for moderate disease.

microscopic_polyangiitis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric microscopic polyangiitis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic fatigue and microscopic haematuria
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old girl was referred by her GP following persistent lethargy and incidental finding of 3+ blood on urinalysis. Investigations showed a mild normocytic anaemia and a rising creatinine; p-ANCA was positive. She was diagnosed with paediatric MPA and started on a paediatric vasculitis protocol including rituximab, showing significant improvement in inflammatory markers.

microscopic_polyangiitis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Microscopic polyangiitis with mononeuritis multiplex
  presenting_complaint: Right foot drop and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female presented with sudden onset right foot drop and numbness in a glove-and-stocking distribution. She reported a 10kg weight loss over three months and night sweats. Nerve conduction studies and MPO-ANCA testing confirmed MPA-associated mononeuritis multiplex, which responded slowly to aggressive immunosuppression.

microscopic_polyangiitis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic renal failure secondary to MPA
  presenting_complaint: Worsening peripheral oedema and hypertension
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with known CKD stage 3 presented with rapidly worsening leg oedema and uncontrolled blood pressure.

microscopic_polyangiitis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory microscopic polyangiitis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent haematuria despite treatment
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male previously diagnosed with MPA failed to achieve remission after six months of cyclophosphamide. He continued to have active urinary sediment and rising MPO-ANCA titres. Treatment was switched to mycophenolate mofetil and a second course of rituximab, which finally induced clinical stability.

microscopic_polyangiitis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Microscopic polyangiitis mimicking pulmonary infection
  presenting_complaint: Productive cough, fever, and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female was initially treated for suspected community-acquired pneumonia with multiple courses of antibiotics. Lack of response and development of microscopic haematuria prompted a vasculitis screen, which was MPO-ANCA positive. Lung biopsy confirmed capillaritis without granulomas, leading to a diagnosis of MPA.

microscopic_polyangiitis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Microscopic polyangiitis with gastrointestinal involvement
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal pain and bloody stools
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male presented as a surgical emergency with acute abdominal pain and haematochezia. Laparotomy showed areas of small bowel ischaemia, and histopathology revealed small vessel vasculitis. Subsequent MPO-ANCA testing and renal involvement confirmed MPA, necessitating long-term immunosuppression.

microscopic_polyangiitis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Microscopic polyangiitis with ocular involvement
  presenting_complaint: Red, painful eye and blurred vision
  summary_of_course: A 71-year-old female presented with scleritis that was unresponsive to topical treatments. Systemic review revealed mild renal impairment and night sweats. Serology was MPO-ANCA positive, and a diagnosis of MPA was made; her ocular symptoms resolved rapidly once systemic corticosteroids were initiated.

microscopic_polyangiitis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-viral microscopic polyangiitis
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN)
  summary_of_course: A 46-year-old male developed gross haematuria and oliguria three weeks following a severe viral upper respiratory tract infection. Investigations showed a crescentic glomerulonephritis on biopsy and high-titre p-ANCA. He was treated with the PEXIVAS protocol (plasma exchange and steroids), preventing the need for long-term dialysis.

microscopic_polyangiitis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Propylthiouracil-induced microscopic polyangiitis
  presenting_complaint: Skin rash and joint pains
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female being treated for Graves' disease with propylthiouracil (PTU) developed a vasculitic rash and arthralgia. Labs showed MPO-ANCA positivity and mild proteinuria. The PTU was discontinued, and she received a short course of steroids, leading to complete resolution of symptoms and seroconversion to ANCA negativity.

microscopic_polyangiitis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Microscopic polyangiitis with cardiac involvement
  presenting_complaint: Chest pain and shortness of breath
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male presented with pericarditic chest pain and breathlessness. Echocardiography showed a pericardial effusion, and bloods revealed AKI with a creatinine of 310 µmol/L. MPO-ANCA was positive, and he was diagnosed with MPA-associated pericarditis and renal failure, responding well to cyclophosphamide.

microscopic_polyangiitis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild microscopic polyangiitis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent low-grade fever and myalgia
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female presented with vague constitutional symptoms and muscle aches lasting several months.

MPA was diagnosed based on MPO-ANCA and renal biopsy; she was managed successfully with oral steroids and azathioprine.

microscopic_polyangiitis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Relapsing microscopic polyangiitis
  presenting_complaint: Rising ANCA titres and return of fatigue
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male in remission for five years presented for routine follow-up with a significant rise in MPO-ANCA titres. Although initially asymptomatic, he soon developed recurrent haematuria and epistaxis. He was treated for a major relapse with a repeat course of rituximab, achieving a second remission.

microscopic_polyangiitis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Postpartum microscopic polyangiitis
  presenting_complaint: Acute renal failure six weeks postpartum
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female presented six weeks after an uncomplicated delivery with severe hypertension and AKI. Initially suspected to be atypical HUS or pre-eclampsia, further testing revealed MPO-ANCA positivity. Renal biopsy confirmed pauci-immune GN, and she was started on steroids and rituximab with partial recovery of renal function.

microscopic_polyangiitis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe microscopic polyangiitis in the elderly
  presenting_complaint: Fulminant respiratory and renal failure
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old female with multiple comorbidities presented with diffuse alveolar haemorrhage and anuria. Given her extreme frailty and the severity of multi-organ failure, a palliative approach was discussed with the family. She was managed with comfort measures and passed away shortly after admission; MPA was confirmed on post-mortem serology.

microscopic_polyangiitis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Microscopic polyangiitis mimicking malignancy
  presenting_complaint: Chronic cough, weight loss, and lung nodules
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male smoker presented with weight loss and multiple small nodules on chest CT, raising suspicion of metastatic lung cancer. Biopsy of a nodule showed capillaritis and no malignant cells. Subsequent p-ANCA testing was positive, and he was successfully treated for MPA with clinical and radiological resolution.

microscopic_polyangiitis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Microscopic polyangiitis with cutaneous and renal involvement
  presenting_complaint: Chronic leg ulcers and frothy urine
  summary_of_course: A 47-year-old female had been treated for "venous ulcers" for a year without improvement. She eventually developed nephrotic-range proteinuria and systemic hypertension. Investigation confirmed MPA with both skin and renal involvement; aggressive immunosuppression led to ulcer healing and stabilisation of proteinuria.

microscopic_polyangiitis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Microscopic polyangiitis presenting as septic shock mimic
  presenting_complaint: Fever, hypotension, and multi-organ failure
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old male was admitted with suspected urosepsis, but failed to improve on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Development of a purpuric rash and a negative septic screen prompted a vasculitis workup. High-titre MPO-ANCA led to a diagnosis of a vasculitic crisis (MPA), and he recovered following high-dose steroids and ICU support.
