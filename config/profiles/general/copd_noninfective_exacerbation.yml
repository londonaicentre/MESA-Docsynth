  primary_diagnosis: Mild non-infective COPD exacerbation
  presenting_complaint: Increased shortness of breath and reduced exercise tolerance over three days.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male with GOLD Stage II COPD presented to his GP with increased dyspnoea following exposure to heavy traffic pollution. He reported clear sputum and no pyrexia; chest was clear on auscultation with occasional expiratory wheeze. He was managed in the community with an increased frequency of his salbutamol inhaler and a five-day course of oral prednisolone, resulting in a full return to baseline within one week.

copd_noninfective_exacerbation_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe acute-on-chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure
  presenting_complaint: Severe breathlessness, drowsiness, and inability to speak in full sentences.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female with known severe COPD and long-term oxygen therapy was brought to A&E via ambulance. Arterial blood gas (ABG) on arrival showed pH 7.24, pCO2 8.8 kPa, and pO2 7.1 kPa on 24% oxygen. She was treated with nebulised bronchodilators, intravenous hydrocortisone, and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in the HDU, showing gradual improvement in hypercapnia over 48 hours.

copd_noninfective_exacerbation_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate COPD exacerbation triggered by cold weather
  presenting_complaint: Worsening chest tightness and increased use of rescue medication.
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old retired female smoker presented to the outpatient clinic during a cold spell in January. Clinical examination revealed bilateral polyphonic wheeze but no signs of consolidation or systemic infection (CRP 4 mg/L). She was prescribed a tapering dose of oral steroids and advised on the use of a spacer for her inhalers, which successfully stabilised her symptoms.

copd_noninfective_exacerbation_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute COPD exacerbation with cor pulmonale
  presenting_complaint: Breathlessness accompanied by worsening peripheral oedema and abdominal bloating.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with a 50 pack-year history presented with subacute worsening of dyspnoea and significant pitting oedema to the mid-calf. Investigations showed a dilated right ventricle on echocardiography and elevated BNP, but no evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. He was treated with a combination of intravenous furosemide, nebulisers, and oral steroids, leading to significant diuresis and improved respiratory mechanics.

copd_noninfective_exacerbation_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe COPD exacerbation in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive dyspnoea and pleuritic chest pain.
  summary_of_course: An 18-year-old male with known ZZ phenotype Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency presented with an acute flare of breathlessness. Despite his young age, CT imaging showed extensive panacinar emphysema and large bullae. He required hospital admission for intensive bronchodilator therapy and was screened for a secondary pneumothorax, which was excluded, before being discharged with pulmonary rehabilitation referral.

copd_noninfective_exacerbation_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening COPD exacerbation with NIV failure
  presenting_complaint: Extreme respiratory distress and deteriorating level of consciousness.
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old female with very severe COPD (FEV1 22% predicted) failed to respond to initial NIV in the emergency department, with pH dropping to 7.18. She was urgently intubated and transferred to the ICU for mechanical ventilation. After four days of sedation, intensive steroids, and bronchodilation, she was successfully extubated and transitioned back to her home oxygen regimen.

copd_noninfective_exacerbation_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic COPD exacerbation due to beta-blocker use
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of wheezing and breathlessness shortly after starting new medication.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with mild COPD was recently prescribed propranolol for essential tremor by his GP. He presented to A&E with acute bronchospasm that was refractory to his usual salbutamol inhaler. The beta-blocker was immediately discontinued, and he was treated with nebulised ipratropium bromide and steroids, resulting in rapid symptom resolution.

copd_noninfective_exacerbation_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate non-infective exacerbation with eosinophilic phenotype
  presenting_complaint: Persistent cough and nocturnal breathlessness over two weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old female with a history of COPD and hayfever presented with a subacute decline in lung function. Blood tests revealed a significant peripheral eosinophilia (0.7 x 10^9/L) and a low CRP. She showed an excellent response to a high-dose course of prednisolone, suggesting an eosinophilic-driven non-infective exacerbation.

copd_noninfective_exacerbation_009:
  primary_diagnosis: COPD exacerbation complicated by spontaneous pneumothorax
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, sharp right-sided chest pain and worsening breathlessness.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with severe bullous emphysema presented with acute-on-chronic respiratory distress. Chest X-ray confirmed a 3cm secondary spontaneous pneumothorax on the right side. He required the insertion of a small-bore chest drain alongside standard COPD exacerbation management, leading to lung re-expansion and clinical stabilisation.

copd_noninfective_exacerbation_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute COPD exacerbation in a frail elderly patient
  presenting_complaint: Generalised weakness, reduced mobility, and increased breathlessness.
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including osteoporosis and cognitive impairment presented with a gradual decline in her ability to perform ADLs. Clinical assessment identified a mild COPD flare-up triggered by poor inhaler technique due to arthritis. She was managed with a nebuliser at home and input from the community respiratory team to switch her to a more suitable breath-actuated device.

copd_noninfective_exacerbation_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute COPD exacerbation following allergen exposure
  presenting_complaint: Itchy eyes, sneezing, and severe wheezing after gardening.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with COPD and known grass pollen allergy presented with an acute non-infective flare-up. He lacked systemic symptoms of infection but had significant expiratory wheezing on examination. He was treated with antihistamines in addition to standard bronchodilators and oral steroids, with rapid improvement in his peak flow readings.

copd_noninfective_exacerbation_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Non-infective COPD exacerbation triggered by pulmonary embolism
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of breathlessness and tachycardia.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old female with COPD presented with what appeared to be a standard exacerbation, but her symptoms were disproportionate to her chest signs. A D-dimer was significantly elevated, and a CTPA confirmed a segmental pulmonary embolism. She was managed with both anticoagulation and a short course of steroids for the reactive airway component of her COPD.

copd_noninfective_exacerbation_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-operative COPD exacerbation
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath and low oxygen saturations 24 hours after surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male underwent an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Post-operatively, he developed an acute flare of his COPD, likely due to the effects of general anaesthesia and reduced diaphragmatic excursion. He was treated with intensive physiotherapy and nebulisers on the surgical ward, avoiding the need for NIV.

copd_noninfective_exacerbation_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate COPD exacerbation with diagnostic challenge (HF overlap)
  presenting_complaint: Breathlessness and orthopnoea.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with both COPD and ischaemic heart disease presented with acute dyspnoea. Initial diagnosis was unclear between a COPD flare and congestive heart failure; however, a normal BNP and clear lung bases with marked wheeze pointed towards a non-infective COPD exacerbation. He responded well to bronchodilators and steroids without the need for increased diuretics.

copd_noninfective_exacerbation_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute COPD exacerbation triggered by air pollution
  presenting_complaint: Chest tightness and increased coughing during a "smog" event.
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old city dweller with moderate COPD presented to the walk-in centre during a period of high particulate matter levels. He had no fever and clear sputum, but his FEV1 had dropped by 200ml from his baseline. He was started on a short course of oral prednisolone and advised to stay indoors until air quality improved, which resolved the episode.

copd_noninfective_exacerbation_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe COPD exacerbation with anxiety-induced hyperventilation
  presenting_complaint: Intense breathlessness, tingling in fingers, and panic.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old female with severe COPD and a history of panic disorder presented in acute distress. While she was having a genuine non-infective exacerbation, her symptoms were exacerbated by hyperventilation, causing a respiratory alkalosis on top of her baseline hypercapnia. Management involved low-dose lorazepam, reassurance, and standard COPD therapy, which stabilised her condition.

copd_noninfective_exacerbation_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic worsening of COPD in a palliative setting
  presenting_complaint: Gradual increase in baseline dyspnoea and reduced quality of life.
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old male with end-stage COPD and multiple hospital admissions was seen by the palliative care team for a non-infective decline. The focus of management was symptom control using low-dose morphine for breathlessness and fan therapy, rather than aggressive hospital-based interventions. He remained at home with increased community nursing support.

copd_noninfective_exacerbation_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild COPD exacerbation due to treatment non-adherence
  presenting_complaint: Increased breathlessness and frequent use of blue inhaler.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male admitted to stopping his long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) because he felt well. Over two weeks, he developed a subacute exacerbation characterized by increased wheeze and reduced exercise tolerance. Education on the importance of maintenance therapy was provided, and his symptoms improved once he resumed his regular medication.

copd_noninfective_exacerbation_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic COPD exacerbation with metabolic alkalosis overlap
  presenting_complaint: Confusion and worsening shortness of breath.
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old male with severe COPD and chronic CO2 retention was admitted with an exacerbation. Interestingly, his ABG showed a pH of 7.48 despite a pCO2 of 9.0 kPa, due to a compensatory metabolic alkalosis from long-term diuretic use. He was treated cautiously with controlled oxygen and steroids, with close monitoring of his pH and bicarbonate levels.

copd_noninfective_exacerbation_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe non-infective exacerbation in a non-smoker (Occupational)
  presenting_complaint: Cough and breathlessness that worsens during the work week.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male non-smoker with COPD secondary to historical coal dust exposure presented with an acute flare. Investigations showed no signs of infection, but he had significant airflow obstruction on spirometry. He was treated with a combination of ICS/LABA/LAMA and oral steroids, and was advised on stricter PPE use at his current workplace.
