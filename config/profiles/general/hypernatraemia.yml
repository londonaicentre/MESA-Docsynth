hypernatraemia_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Dehydration-induced hypernatraemia
  presenting_complaint: Acute confusion and reduced oral intake
  summary_of_course: An 84-year-old female with dementia was admitted from a care home with a 3-day history of lethargy and poor fluid intake. Clinical examination revealed dry mucous membranes and poor skin turgor; biochemistry showed a serum sodium of 158 mmol/L and urea of 18.2 mmol/L. She was treated with cautious intravenous 5% dextrose and oral water boluses via nasogastric tube, resulting in a gradual correction of sodium over 48 hours.

hypernatraemia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Central diabetes insipidus
  presenting_complaint: Profuse polyuria and extreme thirst
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male underwent transsphenoidal resection of a pituitary macroadenoma. Post-operatively, he developed sudden onset polyuria (>500ml/hr) and serum sodium rose rapidly from 140 to 154 mmol/L within 6 hours. Diagnosis of central diabetes insipidus was made, and he was commenced on titrated doses of intravenous desmopressin, which stabilised his electrolyte balance.

hypernatraemia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Accidental salt poisoning
  presenting_complaint: Seizures and hypertonicity
  summary_of_course: A 4-month-old infant was brought to A&E following a generalised tonic-clonic seizure. Investigations revealed a life-threatening serum sodium of 182 mmol/L, found to be due to incorrectly prepared infant formula using undiluted concentrated powder. Management involved emergency peritoneal dialysis in the PICU to safely lower sodium levels while monitoring for cerebral oedema.

hypernatraemia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
  presenting_complaint: Chronic polyuria and mild cognitive impairment
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old woman with a 20-year history of bipolar affective disorder treated with lithium presented with subacute confusion. Her serum sodium was 152 mmol/L with a low urine osmolality (180 mOsm/kg) despite high plasma osmolality. Lithium was discontinued and she was started on amiloride, leading to a slow improvement in her urinary concentrating ability and sodium levels.

hypernatraemia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Adipsic hypernatraemia
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent hospitalisations for severe hypernatraemia
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male with a history of craniopharyngioma resection presented with a sodium of 165 mmol/L but reported no sensation of thirst. Evaluation confirmed hypothalamic damage affecting the osmoreceptors responsible for thirst and ADH release. He was managed with a strict scheduled fluid intake regimen and daily weights to prevent recurrent fluctuations in serum osmolality.

hypernatraemia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Osmotic diuresis-induced hypernatraemia
  presenting_complaint: Hyperglycaemia and altered mental status
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes presented with Hyperglycaemic Hyperosmolar State (HHS). Initial sodium was 148 mmol/L but corrected sodium was 162 mmol/L due to profound glucose-induced osmotic diuresis. Treatment with 0.9% sodium chloride followed by 0.45% saline was required to address the massive free water deficit while managing blood glucose levels.

hypernatraemia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic hypernatraemia
  presenting_complaint: Sudden neurological deterioration in ICU
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old patient in the ICU for sepsis was inadvertently administered high-volume hypertonic sodium bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis. Serum sodium rose from 142 to 168 mmol/L over 12 hours, leading to focal neurological deficits. The infusion was ceased, and free water was administered via a nasogastric tube to correct the acute salt load.

hypernatraemia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypovolaemic hypernatraemia
  presenting_complaint: Severe diarrhoea and vomiting
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old toddler was admitted with a 5-day history of viral gastroenteritis and inability to tolerate oral fluids. He was clinically shocked with a serum sodium of 156 mmol/L and AKI stage 2. Fluid resuscitation was initiated with isotonic crystalloids to restore perfusion, followed by slower replacement of the water deficit to avoid rapid shifts in brain volume.

hypernatraemia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypernatraemia secondary to high-protein tube feeding
  presenting_complaint: Routine monitoring of ventilated patient
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male on the ICU for pneumonia was receiving concentrated high-protein enteral nutrition. Over 5 days, his sodium rose steadily to 154 mmol/L as a result of increased urea-induced osmotic diuresis and insufficient supplemental free water. The clinical team adjusted the feeding regimen and increased sterile water flushes, which normalised the sodium within 72 hours.

hypernatraemia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Gestational diabetes insipidus
  presenting_complaint: Excessive thirst in the third trimester
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant woman at 34 weeks gestation reported drinking 8 litres of water daily. Serum sodium was 149 mmol/L and liver enzymes were mildly elevated. The condition was attributed to excessive placental vasopressinase activity; she responded well to desmopressin, which is resistant to degradation by the placental enzyme, and symptoms resolved post-partum.

hypernatraemia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Exertional heatstroke-related hypernatraemia
  presenting_complaint: Collapse during a marathon
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male collapsed at mile 22 of a marathon on a hot day. On arrival, his core temperature was 41.2°C and serum sodium was 155 mmol/L due to heavy sweat loss (hypotonic fluid) and inadequate replacement. Rapid cooling and intravenous rehydration with 0.9% saline were performed, successfully resolving the hypernatraemia and preventing multi-organ failure.

hypernatraemia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's Syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Hypertension and mild weakness
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with resistant hypertension was found to have a persistent mild hypernatraemia (146-148 mmol/L) and hypokalaemia (3.1 mmol/L). Further testing revealed a suppressed plasma renin activity and elevated aldosterone levels. An adrenal CT scan confirmed a left-sided cortical adenoma; her electrolyte abnormalities resolved following a laparoscopic adrenalectomy.

hypernatraemia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypernatraemia in palliative care
  presenting_complaint: Drowsiness in terminal phase of illness
  summary_of_course: A 92-year-old male with end-stage heart failure and lung cancer became increasingly somnolent. Biochemistry showed a sodium of 159 mmol/L, likely due to poor oral intake and frailty. Following a multidisciplinary discussion with the family, a decision was made to focus on comfort-based care rather than aggressive intravenous correction of the electrolyte imbalance.

hypernatraemia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Evaporative loss hypernatraemia
  presenting_complaint: Major burn injury
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female was admitted to the burns unit with 45% total body surface area (TBSA) partial and full-thickness burns. Despite aggressive fluid resuscitation, she developed a serum sodium of 153 mmol/L on day 4 due to massive insensible water loss through the denuded skin. Treatment required increasing the free water component of her fluid replacement and meticulous wound dressing.

hypernatraemia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic kidney disease-associated hypernatraemia
  presenting_complaint: Generalised malaise and nocturia
  summary_of_course: A 76-year-old male with Stage 4 CKD (eGFR 22) presented with a sodium of 151 mmol/L during an intercurrent chest infection. His kidneys were unable to maximally concentrate urine, leading to disproportionate water loss during a period of reduced intake. He was treated with cautious oral rehydration and monitoring of his renal function, avoiding rapid fluctuations.

hypernatraemia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Cushing's syndrome (Ectopic ACTH)
  presenting_complaint: Weight gain and proximal muscle weakness
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male with a history of small cell lung cancer presented with new-onset oedema and a sodium of 149 mmol/L. Investigations showed profound hypokalaemic alkalosis and hypernatraemia caused by the mineralocorticoid effects of very high cortisol levels. He was started on metyrapone to inhibit steroid synthesis, which helped stabilise his sodium and potassium levels.

hypernatraemia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-obstructive diuresis
  presenting_complaint: Acute urinary retention and subsequent polyuria
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with prostatic hypertrophy presented with acute urinary retention. Following catheterisation, he had a massive diuresis of 10 litres in 24 hours, leading to a rise in serum sodium to 154 mmol/L. The hypernatraemia was managed by replacing 50% of the hourly urine output with intravenous 0.45% saline until the diuresis subsided.

hypernatraemia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypernatraemia secondary to lactulose overuse
  presenting_complaint: Diarrhoea and confusion in a cirrhotic patient
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with liver cirrhosis was taking high doses of lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy. He developed severe osmotic diarrhoea, leading to a free water deficit and a serum sodium of 157 mmol/L. Lactulose was temporarily withheld and intravenous 5% dextrose was administered to correct the hypernatraemia while monitoring for rebound encephalopathy.

hypernatraemia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Essential hypernatraemia
  presenting_complaint: Chronic mild hypernatraemia
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female was found to have a persistent serum sodium between 148-152 mmol/L during routine screening. Extensive workup showed a "reset osmostat" where her body defended a higher-than-normal sodium level, but she was otherwise asymptomatic and maintained a normal thirst response at this higher threshold. No active intervention was required other than long-term monitoring.

hypernatraemia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic hypernatraemia
  presenting_complaint: Dysphagia and aspiration pneumonia
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old stroke survivor with baseline mild hypernatraemia (146 mmol/L) was admitted with pneumonia and worsened dysphagia. His sodium acutely rose to 162 mmol/L due to the combined effects of fever-induced insensible loss and inability to swallow fluids. He was managed with a combination of intravenous fluids and subsequent PEG tube placement for long-term hydration and nutrition.
