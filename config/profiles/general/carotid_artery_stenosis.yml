carotid_artery_stenosis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Incidental cervical bruit found during routine physical examination
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with hypertension was referred after a left-sided neck bruit was noted during an annual review. Carotid duplex ultrasonography revealed a 30-49% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery with stable peak systolic velocities. The patient remains asymptomatic and was commenced on 75mg aspirin and 40mg atorvastatin with planned annual surveillance.

carotid_artery_stenosis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe symptomatic carotid artery stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of right-sided weakness and expressive aphasia
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female presented with a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) lasting 45 minutes. CT angiography (CTA) confirmed an 85% eccentric stenosis of the left carotid bulb with an ulcerated plaque. She underwent an urgent left carotid endarterectomy (CEA) within 48 hours of presentation and was discharged with no residual neurological deficits.

carotid_artery_stenosis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic total occlusion of the internal carotid artery
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of light-headedness and chronic cognitive decline
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with a history of heavy smoking presented with progressive vascular dementia and orthostatic symptoms. Imaging confirmed a long-standing, 100% total occlusion of the right internal carotid artery with compensatory flow via the Circle of Willis. Given the chronic nature and lack of acute focal deficits, management was focused on intensive risk factor modification rather than surgical intervention.

carotid_artery_stenosis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Radiation-induced carotid artery stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Progressive neck discomfort and TIA symptoms 15 years post-radiotherapy
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female, previously treated for Mantle Cell Lymphoma with neck irradiation, presented with transient monocular blindness (amaurosis fugax). Duplex imaging showed a high-grade 70% stenosis of the common carotid artery, noted for its unusual length and fibrotic appearance. Due to the high risk of surgical planes post-irradiation, she was successfully treated with carotid artery stenting (CAS).

carotid_artery_stenosis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) with moderate stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Pulsatile tinnitus and resistant hypertension
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female with no traditional cardiovascular risk factors was investigated for persistent "whooshing" in her ears. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed the classic "string of beads" appearance in the mid-to-distal right internal carotid artery, suggesting FMD. She was managed conservatively with antiplatelet therapy and regular blood pressure monitoring, as the stenosis was haemodynamically moderate (55%).

carotid_artery_stenosis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic carotid artery stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Crescendo TIAs over a 24-hour period
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with known stable 50% carotid stenosis presented with four episodes of right-arm paraesthesia in one day. Repeat duplex scanning showed the stenosis had progressed to 95% due to suspected intraplaque haemorrhage. He was admitted for urgent anticoagulation followed by an emergency carotid endarterectomy to prevent a major stroke.

carotid_artery_stenosis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe asymptomatic carotid stenosis (pre-operative finding)
  presenting_complaint: Detected during pre-operative screening for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male undergoing workup for triple-vessel coronary disease was found to have a 90% right internal carotid stenosis on screening duplex. Despite being neurologically asymptomatic, the multidisciplinary team opted for a staged approach, performing a carotid endarterectomy two weeks prior to his scheduled CABG to reduce the risk of perioperative stroke.

carotid_artery_stenosis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute carotid artery dissection mimicking stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset neck pain followed by Horner’s syndrome
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male presented after a gym session with severe left-sided neck pain and a droopy eyelid. CTA showed a long-segment narrowing of the left internal carotid artery with a "tapered" appearance, consistent with an intramural haematoma and dissection. He was treated with therapeutic anticoagulation (heparin followed by warfarin) with near-complete resolution of the narrowing on follow-up imaging at three months.

carotid_artery_stenosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-endarterectomy neointimal hyperplasia
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent bruit found 18 months post-surgery
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female who underwent a successful left CEA 18 months ago was noted to have a new bruit during a follow-up clinic. Duplex ultrasound confirmed a 75% recurrent stenosis at the distal end of the previous patch angioplasty, attributed to neointimal hyperplasia rather than atherosclerosis. She remained asymptomatic and was managed with increased statin dosing and close duplex surveillance every six months.

carotid_artery_stenosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Tandem carotid artery lesions
  presenting_complaint: Left-sided hemiplegia and neglect
  summary_of_course: A 71-year-old male presented with an acute ischaemic stroke in the right MCA territory. Initial CTA revealed a 70% stenosis at the right carotid bulb and a second, more distal 80% stenosis in the petrous portion of the internal carotid artery. This tandem lesion required complex neuro-interventional management involving proximal stenting to allow access for distal mechanical thrombectomy.

carotid_artery_stenosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Bilateral severe carotid artery stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent syncope and global cognitive decline
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old female presented with "drop attacks" and worsening memory loss over six months. Imaging revealed 85% stenosis of the left internal carotid and 80% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery. Due to her frailty and multiple comorbidities, she was managed with optimal medical therapy and a permanent pacemaker for concurrent bradycardia, as surgical intervention was deemed high-risk.

carotid_artery_stenosis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Ulcerated plaque with mobile thrombus
  presenting_complaint: Transient monocular vision loss (amaurosis fugax)
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male described "a shutter coming down" over his left eye for 10 minutes. Duplex ultrasound showed a moderate 60% stenosis but highlighted a 4mm mobile thrombus attached to an ulcerated plaque. He was immediately heparinised and underwent an urgent carotid endarterectomy to remove the embolic source, despite the stenosis technically being below the traditional 70% threshold for asymptomatic surgery.

carotid_artery_stenosis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Calcified "eggshell" carotid stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty with duplex imaging due to acoustic shadowing
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (CKD stage 5) was referred for suspected carotid disease. Initial duplex was non-diagnostic due to heavy circumferential calcification ("eggshell" plaque) causing severe acoustic shadowing. A follow-up CT angiogram was required to accurately quantify the stenosis at 65% and guide management.

carotid_artery_stenosis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Takayasu's arteritis involving the carotid arteries
  presenting_complaint: Malaise, night sweats, and absent radial pulses
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female of East Asian descent presented with systemic inflammatory symptoms and exertional arm claudication. Imaging confirmed pan-aortitis with a long-segment 60% stenosis of the left common carotid artery and subclavian involvement. She was treated with high-dose prednisolone and methotrexate, which successfully reduced the inflammatory markers and stabilised the carotid luminal narrowing.

carotid_artery_stenosis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Near-occlusion of the internal carotid artery (string sign)
  presenting_complaint: Repeated episodes of transient right-sided numbness
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male presented with frequent TIA symptoms. MRA demonstrated a "string sign," indicating severe near-occlusion of the left internal carotid artery with a collapsed distal lumen. Given the high risk of imminent total occlusion, he was fast-tracked for carotid stenting as the collapsed lumen made the surgical distal control for endarterectomy technically challenging.

carotid_artery_stenosis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric accelerated carotid atherosclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset hemiparesis in a 14-year-old
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old male with a history of neck irradiation for Hodgkin’s lymphoma at age 4 presented with a stroke. Workup surprisingly revealed a 75% stenotic lesion of the right internal carotid artery, consistent with radiation-induced accelerated atherosclerosis. He underwent a successful paediatric carotid endarterectomy, a rare procedure for his age group, and was started on long-term antiplatelet therapy.

carotid_artery_stenosis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: In-stent restenosis (ISR)
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic finding on 3-year post-stenting surveillance
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male who had a right carotid stent placed three years prior was found to have peak systolic velocities >300 cm/s on routine duplex. CTA confirmed a 85% in-stent restenosis caused by significant neointimal growth through the stent struts. He was managed with drug-coated balloon angioplasty to restore the luminal diameter and avoid the morbidity of a secondary open surgery.

carotid_artery_stenosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Embolic stroke from low-grade ulcerated stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Left-sided facial droop and slurred speech
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male presented with a minor ischaemic stroke. Carotid duplex showed only a 40% stenosis on the right, but high-resolution MRI of the vessel wall revealed a lipid-rich necrotic core with plaque rupture. Despite the low degree of luminal narrowing, he was treated as "symptomatic" due to the high-risk plaque morphology and underwent endarterectomy to prevent further embolic events.

carotid_artery_stenosis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Carotid artery stenosis with hypersensitive carotid sinus
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent syncope triggered by turning the head
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male presented with frequent faints particularly when wearing a tight collar or turning his neck. Investigations revealed a 70% right carotid stenosis and profound asystole during carotid sinus massage (hypersensitivity). He required the insertion of a permanent dual-chamber pacemaker before his carotid stenosis could be safely addressed surgically.

carotid_artery_stenosis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Hyperperfusion syndrome following carotid endarterectomy
  presenting_complaint: Severe hemicranial headache and seizures post-CEA
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old female underwent a successful left CEA for a 95% stenosis. Six hours post-operatively, she developed a literal "bursting" headache followed by a focal seizure; CT showed patchy vasogenic oedema but no haemorrhage. This was diagnosed as cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome due to loss of autoregulation, and she was aggressively treated in the ICU with IV labetalol to maintain a strict systolic blood pressure below 120 mmHg.
