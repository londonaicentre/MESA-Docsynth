malignant_neuroleptic_syndrome_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Classic malignant neuroleptic syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Severe muscle rigidity, high fever, and altered consciousness
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with schizophrenia was admitted to the ICU after a rapid dose escalation of haloperidol. He presented with "lead-pipe" rigidity, a temperature of 40.2°C, and fluctuating blood pressure. Investigations revealed a CK of 25,000 U/L and leucocytosis; he was treated with dantrolene and aggressive cooling, leading to gradual recovery over 10 days.

malignant_neuroleptic_syndrome_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Atypical malignant neuroleptic syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, diaphoresis, and tachycardia without significant rigidity
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old female on clozapine for treatment-resistant schizophrenia presented with subacute onset of autonomic instability and delirium. Unlike classic cases, she lacked significant motor rigidity but had a CK of 4,000 U/L and persistent pyrexia. Clozapine was discontinued, and she was managed with lorazepam and IV fluids, resolving within a week.

malignant_neuroleptic_syndrome_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Parkinsonism-hyperpyrexia syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Acute stupor and hyperthermia following medication cessation
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with long-standing Parkinson’s disease presented in a state of "akinetic crisis" after abruptly stopping his levodopa/carbidopa. He exhibited NMS-like features including hyperpyrexia and severe rigidity. Symptoms improved rapidly upon the reintroduction of dopaminergic agents via nasogastric tube and supportive hydration.

malignant_neuroleptic_syndrome_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric malignant neuroleptic syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Agitation, stiffness, and refusal to drink
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old boy with autism spectrum disorder was started on risperidone for behavioural challenges. Within 48 hours, he developed acute dystonia followed by generalised rigidity and a temperature of 39.5°C. He was transferred to a paediatric high dependency unit for IV bromocriptine and monitoring of his renal function.

malignant_neuroleptic_syndrome_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Depot-induced prolonged malignant neuroleptic syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Protracted confusion and muscle stiffness
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female received a flupentixol decanoate injection three days prior to presenting with subacute NMS. Due to the long-acting nature of the depot medication, her symptoms of rigidity and autonomic instability persisted for three weeks despite stopping oral agents. She required prolonged ICU admission and repeated doses of dantrolene to manage recurrent pyrexia.

malignant_neuroleptic_syndrome_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Antiemetic-induced malignant neuroleptic syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Post-operative pyrexia and "locked-in" stiffness
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female undergoing cholecystectomy received repeated doses of metoclopramide for post-operative nausea. She developed sudden-onset tachycardia, diaphoresis, and severe limb rigidity initially mistaken for a surgical complication. Diagnosis was confirmed by a CK of 12,000 U/L, and she recovered following metoclopramide cessation and IV benzodiazepines.

malignant_neuroleptic_syndrome_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe NMS with rhabdomyolysis and AKI
  presenting_complaint: Dark urine, high fever, and inability to move limbs
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old male with bipolar disorder presented with life-threatening NMS after starting olanzapine. He developed profound rhabdomyolysis (CK 85,000 U/L) leading to stage 3 acute kidney injury requiring continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVH). Despite the severity, he survived with intensive multidisciplinary care but retained some residual motor stiffness.

malignant_neuroleptic_syndrome_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild malignant neuroleptic syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Low-grade fever and mild "cogwheel" rigidity
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male on long-term quetiapine for depression with psychosis reported feeling "stiff and shaky" over several days. Clinical examination showed mild rigidity and a temperature of 37.9°C with a CK of 1,200 U/L. Early recognition led to immediate cessation of quetiapine and outpatient monitoring, with symptoms resolving without hospitalisation.

malignant_neuroleptic_syndrome_009:
  primary_diagnosis: NMS and Serotonin Syndrome overlap
  presenting_complaint: Hyperreflexia, rigidity, and hyperthermia
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old female taking both sertraline and prochlorperazine presented with a complex toxidrome. She exhibited both the "lead-pipe" rigidity of NMS and the hyperreflexia/clonus typical of serotonin syndrome. Treatment involved stopping all serotonergic and dopaminergic agents, with management focused on benzodiazepines and cooling.

malignant_neuroleptic_syndrome_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory malignant neuroleptic syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Persistent hyperthermia despite dantrolene therapy
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male failed to respond to standard NMS treatments including dantrolene and bromocriptine after a reaction to zuclopenthixol. His condition remained critical with persistent autonomic instability for 14 days. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was initiated as a rescue treatment, resulting in a dramatic improvement in both mental state and physical symptoms.

malignant_neuroleptic_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-partum malignant neuroleptic syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of mutism and high fever post-delivery
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female treated for post-partum psychosis with aripiprazole developed sudden mutism and rigidity on day 4 of treatment. Initially diagnosed as catatonia, the development of a 40.0°C fever and elevated liver enzymes shifted the diagnosis to NMS. She was successfully treated with lorazepam and transfer to a specialist mother and baby unit.

malignant_neuroleptic_syndrome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: NMS in a patient with learning disabilities
  presenting_complaint: Unexplained distress, sweating, and reduced mobility
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old non-verbal male with a learning disability was brought to A&E by carers for increased agitation and sweating. Physical exam revealed significant stiffness and a heart rate of 140 bpm; investigations showed a CK of 8,000 U/L. The diagnosis of NMS was made secondary to a recent increase in his chlorpromazine dose, and he was managed in a side room with 1:1 nursing.

malignant_neuroleptic_syndrome_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute malignant neuroleptic syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Gradual decline in mobility and worsening confusion
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old female with Lewy Body Dementia was started on a low dose of risperidone for distressing hallucinations. Over two weeks, she became progressively more immobile and confused, with a fluctuating low-grade pyrexia. Recognition of NMS led to drug withdrawal, though her recovery was complicated by a hospital-acquired pneumonia.

malignant_neuroleptic_syndrome_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening NMS with DIC
  presenting_complaint: Bleeding from IV sites, hyperpyrexia, and coma
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male developed fulminant NMS following an overdose of his antipsychotic medication. The extreme hyperthermia (41.5°C) triggered disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and multi-organ failure. Despite maximal ICU support, including cooling and blood product replacement, the patient succumbed to a massive intracranial haemorrhage.

malignant_neuroleptic_syndrome_015:
  primary_diagnosis: NMS secondary to low-potency neuroleptics
  presenting_complaint: Tremor, rigidity, and tachycardia
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female with chronic schizophrenia on stable chlorpromazine therapy developed NMS following a severe bout of dehydration during a heatwave. The physiological stress likely lowered her threshold for the syndrome. She was treated with aggressive rehydration and temporary cessation of her neuroleptics, with a full recovery within five days.

malignant_neuroleptic_syndrome_016:
  primary_diagnosis: NMS triggered by prochlorperazine
  presenting_complaint: Severe neck stiffness and fever following vertigo treatment
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male was prescribed prochlorperazine for labyrinthitis and presented 48 hours later with what was initially thought to be meningitis. Lumbar puncture was normal, but bloods showed a CK of 18,000 U/L and a white cell count of 19.0 x 10^9/L. The diagnosis of NMS was made, and he responded well to supportive care and fluids.

malignant_neuroleptic_syndrome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: NMS complicated by aspiration pneumonia
  presenting_complaint: Respiratory distress and rigidity
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male with severe NMS developed oropharyngeal dysphagia and impaired cough reflex due to bulbar muscle rigidity. This led to a large-volume aspiration of gastric contents and subsequent ARDS. He required mechanical ventilation and a prolonged course of antibiotics alongside NMS treatment with bromocriptine.

malignant_neuroleptic_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Lithium-augmented malignant neuroleptic syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Coarse tremor, rigidity, and delirium
  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old male with bipolar disorder on a combination of lithium and haloperidol presented with features of both lithium toxicity and NMS. The synergy between the two drugs appeared to worsen the neurotoxicity and rigidity. He required saline diuresis for the lithium and dantrolene for the NMS, with a slow neurological recovery over two weeks.

malignant_neuroleptic_syndrome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: NMS triggered by MDMA and antipsychotic interaction
  presenting_complaint: Extreme agitation, hyperthermia, and seizures
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old male on olanzapine for first-episode psychosis presented after consuming MDMA (Ecstasy) at a party. The combination triggered a rapid-onset NMS-like state with a temperature of 41.0°C and profound rigidity. He was managed with an iced-water bath, midazolam for seizures, and ICU monitoring, eventually making a full recovery.

malignant_neuroleptic_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic malignant neuroleptic syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of Parkinsonian symptoms and new fever
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with long-standing schizophrenia on stable trifluoperazine was admitted with a UTI. The systemic infection precipitated a sudden transition into NMS, characterised by "lead-pipe" rigidity and autonomic instability. He was treated for the underlying sepsis while simultaneously managing the NMS with neuroleptic withdrawal and lorazepam.
