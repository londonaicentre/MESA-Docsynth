  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset polyarthritis involving knees and wrists.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including T2DM and CKD developed polyarthritis after a urinary tract infection (E. coli). Diagnostic challenge arose due to suspicion of crystal arthropathy, but synovial fluid was negative for crystals. Due to CKD, NSAIDs were avoided, and she was successfully treated with low-dose oral prednisolone.

reactive_arthropathy_011:
  primary_diagnosis: HIV-associated reactive arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Extensive skin crusting and severe joint pain.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male presented with severe keratoderma blennorrhagicum and asymmetric polyarthritis. Subsequent testing revealed a new diagnosis of HIV with a low CD4 count. The arthritis was particularly aggressive, requiring a combination of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and cautious use of DMARDs.

reactive_arthropathy_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-streptococcal reactive arthritis (PSRA)
  presenting_complaint: Migratory joint pains and malaise.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female presented with migratory large joint pain ten days after a confirmed streptococcal sore throat.

  presenting_complaint: Multiple joint swellings following an outbreak at a workplace canteen.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old chef developed reactive arthritis after a workplace outbreak of Shigella sonnei. He was one of several employees affected, but his case was the most severe due to his HLA-B27 status. He required intensive physiotherapy and a temporary change in work duties due to persistent dactylitis.

reactive_arthropathy_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Pregnancy-associated reactive arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral knee pain in the second trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old pregnant female developed reactive arthritis after a Salmonella infection.
