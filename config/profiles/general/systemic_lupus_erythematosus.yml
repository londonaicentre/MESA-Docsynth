She underwent emergency embolectomy and was commenced on lifelong warfarin alongside hydroxychloroquine.

systemic_lupus_erythematosus_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Libman-Sacks Endocarditis
  presenting_complaint: Exertional dyspnoea and splinter haemorrhages
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female with long-standing SLE presented with worsening breathlessness and clinical signs of mitral regurgitation. Echocardiography revealed sterile vegetations on the mitral valve consistent with Libman-Sacks endocarditis. Management required intensification of immunosuppression and valve repair surgery due to progressive heart failure.

systemic_lupus_erythematosus_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Flare
  presenting_complaint: Severe fatigue and worsening alopecia
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female with known SLE, previously stable on hydroxychloroquine, presented with a significant flare following intense sun exposure. She exhibited diffuse alopecia, oral ulcers, and profound lethargy with rising ESR and falling complement levels. Her treatment was escalated to include methotrexate, which successfully controlled the cutaneous and constitutional symptoms.

systemic_lupus_erythematosus_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Hypertension and proteinuria at 24 weeks gestation
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old pregnant woman with SLE presented with a rise in blood pressure and new proteinuria, posing a diagnostic challenge between pre-eclampsia and lupus nephritis flare. Low complement levels and rising anti-dsDNA titres suggested a lupus flare. She was managed with increased prednisolone and aspirin, allowing the pregnancy to continue to 34 weeks.

systemic_lupus_erythematosus_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Late-Onset Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent pleural effusions
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old woman presented with bilateral pleural effusions of unknown aetiology. Pleural fluid analysis was exudative with low glucose, and subsequent serology revealed a high-titre ANA and anti-Ro antibodies. Despite her age, she was diagnosed with late-onset SLE and responded well to low-dose steroids and hydroxychloroquine.

systemic_lupus_erythematosus_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus presenting as Evans Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice, bruising, and profound weakness
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old male presented with symptomatic anaemia and petechiae. Bloods confirmed autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (Coombs positive) and immune thrombocytopenia (Evans syndrome). Further screening identified positive ANA and anti-dsDNA, confirming SLE as the primary driver; he required IVIG and high-dose steroids to stabilise his haematological parameters.

systemic_lupus_erythematosus_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Cutaneous Lupus progressing to SLE
  presenting_complaint: Discoid skin lesions and new-onset nocturia
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with a 10-year history of discoid lupus presented with new systemic symptoms and peripheral oedema. Investigations showed a transition to systemic disease with biopsy-proven Class V (membranous) lupus nephritis. He was commenced on a regimen of ACE inhibitors and mycophenolate mofetil to manage the nephrotic-range proteinuria.

systemic_lupus_erythematosus_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Lupus Mesenteric Vasculitis
  presenting_complaint: Acute severe abdominal pain and vomiting
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female with known SLE presented to the surgical team with an acute abdomen. CT imaging showed "target sign" bowel wall thickening and mesenteric oedema, suggestive of lupus vasculitis rather than a surgical emergency. She was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone and bowel rest, avoiding unnecessary laparotomy.

systemic_lupus_erythematosus_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Shrinking Lung Syndrome in SLE
  presenting_complaint: Progressive dyspnoea and pleuritic pain
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old woman with chronic SLE reported increasing shortness of breath when lying flat. Pulmonary function tests showed a restrictive pattern, and chest X-ray revealed unexplained small lung volumes with elevated diaphragms. Diagnosis of shrinking lung syndrome was made, and her respiratory muscle function improved following treatment with corticosteroids and theophylline.

systemic_lupus_erythematosus_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
  presenting_complaint: Persistent polyarthritis despite multiple therapies
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female remained symptomatic with active synovitis despite sequential trials of methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate. Due to high disease activity (SLEDAI score 12), she was transitioned to biological therapy with Rituximab. Following two cycles, she achieved clinical remission with normalisation of serological markers.

  primary_diagnosis: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus with Secondary Sjögren’s Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Severe dry eyes and parotid gland swelling
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old woman with a history of SLE presented with debilitating sicca symptoms and recurrent parotitis. Schirmer's test was positive, and biopsy of the minor salivary glands confirmed secondary Sjögren’s syndrome. Management focused on topical lubricants and pilocarpine, alongside her existing hydroxychloroquine for SLE.

systemic_lupus_erythematosus_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Bullous Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
  presenting_complaint: Widespread blistering of the skin
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old female presented with an acute onset of subepidermal blisters on her trunk and limbs. Skin biopsy and direct immunofluorescence showed linear IgA deposits at the dermo-epidermal junction in a patient with known SLE. She was successfully treated with dapsone, which is specifically effective for this rare bullous variant of lupus.

systemic_lupus_erythematosus_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus with Diffuse Alveolar Haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Haemoptysis and rapid respiratory failure
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old male presented with sudden onset cough, haemoptysis, and dropping haemoglobin. Bronchoalveolar lavage confirmed diffuse alveolar haemorrhage, and serology was strongly positive for anti-dsDNA. This life-threatening manifestation was treated aggressively with plasma exchange, pulsed methylprednisolone, and cyclophosphamide in the ICU.

systemic_lupus_erythematosus_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Chilblain Lupus Erythematosus
  presenting_complaint: Painful purple lesions on fingers and toes
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old woman presented during winter with painful, itchy, violaceous acral plaques. While initially thought to be simple chilblains, the persistence into spring and a positive ANA led to a diagnosis of chilblain lupus. She was advised on cold avoidance and commenced on nifedipine and topical steroids with moderate success.
