  presenting_complaint: Localised swelling and redness after dental work.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old woman developed significant swelling of the buccal mucosa 24 hours after a dental filling involving lidocaine. Initial suspicion of infection was ruled out. Patch testing confirmed a delayed hypersensitivity to amide-type local anaesthetics, and she was successfully transitioned to ester-type alternatives for future procedures.

allergic_reaction_to_drug_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Delayed hypersensitivity to multiple antibiotics
  presenting_complaint: Chronic pruritic rash in an elderly patient.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities developed a persistent morbilliform rash while being treated for a complex UTI with various antibiotics. Identifying the culprit was difficult due to polypharmacy. Sequential withdrawal and skin patch testing eventually identified nitrofurantoin as the causative agent.

allergic_reaction_to_drug_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Ferric carboxymaltose infusion reaction
  presenting_complaint: Sudden hypotension and flushing during iron infusion.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old pregnant woman with iron-deficiency anaemia developed a "Fishbane" reaction (flushing, chest pressure, and transient hypotension) during IV iron administration. The infusion was paused for 15 minutes and then restarted at a slower rate without further incident. This was classified as a non-immunological hypersensitivity reaction.

allergic_reaction_to_drug_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Rocuronium-induced perioperative anaphylaxis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden loss of capnography trace and hypotension during induction.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male underwent emergency laparotomy; immediately following rocuronium administration, his airway pressures rose sharply and BP dropped to 60/30 mmHg. He was managed with bolus adrenaline and the surgery was postponed. Post-operative skin prick testing confirmed rocuronium allergy, and sugammadex was used for immediate reversal.

allergic_reaction_to_drug_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Clopidogrel-induced pruritic exanthema
  presenting_complaint: Persistent itchy rash on the trunk.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old woman developed a pruritic, erythematous rash ten days after starting clopidogrel post-PCI. Because of the high risk of stent thrombosis, she was treated with oral antihistamines and a short course of prednisolone while continuing the antiplatelet therapy. The rash eventually desensitised, allowing her to complete the required 12-month course.

allergic_reaction_to_drug_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Naproxen-induced photoallergic reaction
  presenting_complaint: Sun-exposed skin rash and burning sensation.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old woman developed an eczematous eruption on her face, neck, and dorsal hands while taking naproxen for osteoarthritis. The distribution suggested a light-mediated response. Photopatch testing confirmed a photoallergic reaction to the NSAID, and symptoms resolved upon cessation of the drug and use of sun protection.
