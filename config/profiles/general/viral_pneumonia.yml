  primary_diagnosis: Avian Influenza (H5N1) pneumonia
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive respiratory failure and multi-organ dysfunction.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female with recent travel to a region with known avian flu outbreaks presented with severe viral pneumonia. She rapidly deteriorated into refractory hypoxaemia and required Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). Despite intensive antiviral therapy and organ support, she succumbed to multi-organ failure on day 12.

viral_pneumonia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) pneumonia
  presenting_complaint: Unexplained respiratory failure in a critically ill patient.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male intubated for major trauma developed worsening lung compliance and bloody secretions on day 14 of ICU admission. Bronchoscopy showed herpetic tracheobronchitis, and BAL confirmed HSV-1 pneumonia. He was treated with a 14-day course of intravenous aciclovir, resulting in successful weaning from the ventilator.
