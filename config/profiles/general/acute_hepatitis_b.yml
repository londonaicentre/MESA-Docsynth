acute_hepatitis_b_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Uncomplicated Acute Hepatitis B
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice, nausea, and right upper quadrant discomfort
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old male presented with a 1-week history of malaise and tea-coloured urine. Investigations revealed ALT 1450 U/L and Bilirubin 85 µmol/L, with positive HBsAg and IgM anti-HBc. He was managed conservatively with supportive care in the community, and subsequent follow-up showed complete seroconversion to anti-HBs within six months.

acute_hepatitis_b_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Fulminant Acute Hepatitis B
  presenting_complaint: Altered mental status and severe icterus
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with no prior history presented with Grade II hepatic encephalopathy and a significantly raised INR of 2.8. Laboratory tests confirmed acute HBV infection with a high viral load; she was admitted to the ICU for monitoring and started on Tenofovir. Despite aggressive management, she met King's College criteria and was listed for urgent liver transplantation.

acute_hepatitis_b_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute HBV and HDV Co-infection
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and deep jaundice
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male intravenous drug user presented with acute onset of severe hepatitis. Serology confirmed concurrent acute Hepatitis B and Hepatitis D infection, leading to a more severe clinical course than typical monoinfection. He required a prolonged hospital stay for nutritional support and monitoring of coagulopathy but eventually recovered without liver failure.

acute_hepatitis_b_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis B with Serum Sickness-like Prodrome
  presenting_complaint: Fever, maculopapular rash, and polyarthralgia
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old female presented with a systemic rash and joint pain involving the small joints of the hands, initially suspected to be a rheumatological condition. Two weeks later, she developed clinical jaundice and an ALT spike of 2200 U/L. HBsAg and IgM anti-HBc were positive, confirming acute HBV with an extrahepatic prodrome; symptoms resolved as jaundice peaked.

acute_hepatitis_b_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis B in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes during routine screening
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old pregnant woman (32 weeks gestation) was found to have HBsAg and IgM anti-HBc during routine antenatal screening following a recent exposure. She remained clinically well with mild transaminitis (ALT 310 U/L). To reduce the risk of vertical transmission, she was started on Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and the neonate received HBIG and vaccination at birth.

acute_hepatitis_b_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute Hepatitis B with Protracted Cholestasis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent pruritus and deep jaundice for six weeks
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old male presented with a subacute course of HBV infection characterised by lingering jaundice and intense itching. While transaminases began to decline, his Bilirubin peaked at 420 µmol/L and remained elevated for over a month. He was treated with Ursodeoxycholic acid for symptomatic relief of cholestasis, eventually achieving clinical resolution after 12 weeks.

acute_hepatitis_b_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute HBV Reactivation mimicking Acute Infection
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of jaundice and fatigue
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male undergoing Rituximab therapy for lymphoma presented with acute liver failure. Although initially appearing as a new acute infection, review of records showed he was HBsAg negative/anti-HBc positive at baseline. This severe reactivation presented with high HBV DNA and IgM anti-HBc, requiring emergency admission and antiviral therapy with Entecavir.

acute_hepatitis_b_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis B in an Immunocompromised Patient
  presenting_complaint: Mild lethargy and anorexia
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old renal transplant recipient on Tacrolimus presented with subtle symptoms and an ALT of 180 U/L. Despite the mild presentation, HBV DNA was extremely high ( >8 log10 IU/mL) and HBsAg was positive. Due to the high risk of progression to chronic infection in an immunosuppressed state, he was started on immediate antiviral therapy.

acute_hepatitis_b_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis B with Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN)
  presenting_complaint: Hypertension, mononeuritis multiplex, and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old male presented with systemic vasculitis symptoms including foot drop and livedo reticularis. Investigations revealed necrotising vasculitis on biopsy and concurrent acute HBV infection (HBsAg+, IgM anti-HBc+). He was treated with a combination of plasma exchange, corticosteroids, and Tenofovir to manage the life-threatening extrahepatic manifestations.

acute_hepatitis_b_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Acute Hepatitis B
  presenting_complaint: Low-grade fever and mild abdominal pain
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old child, recently arrived from an endemic region, presented with non-specific viral symptoms. Blood tests showed an ALT of 600 U/L and positive HBsAg. Given the paediatric age group, he was monitored closely for chronicity; unlike adults, he failed to clear the HBsAg after six months, progressing to chronic hepatitis B.

acute_hepatitis_b_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis B via Occupational Exposure
  presenting_complaint: Anxiety following a needle-stick injury and subsequent jaundice
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old healthcare worker suffered a hollow-bore needle injury from a known HBV-positive patient. Despite receiving a booster vaccine, she had not completed the full series and developed symptomatic acute hepatitis B six weeks later. She experienced a moderate course with ALT peaking at 1100 U/L but successfully cleared the virus spontaneously.

acute_hepatitis_b_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic Hepatitis B Flare
  presenting_complaint: Acute exacerbation of fatigue and jaundice
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male with known inactive chronic HBV presented with a sudden ALT rise to 900 U/L and positive IgM anti-HBc. This "flare" mimicked acute infection but was differentiated by previous records of HBsAg positivity. He was started on Tenofovir due to the risk of hepatic decompensation given his underlying stage 2 fibrosis.

acute_hepatitis_b_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis B with HIV Co-infection
  presenting_complaint: Fever, lymphadenopathy, and jaundice
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male presented with symptoms of an acute viral illness. Screening confirmed simultaneous acute HBV and new diagnosis of HIV infection. Due to the high risk of HBV chronicity and rapid HIV progression, a HAART regimen containing Tenofovir and Emtricitabine was initiated to treat both viruses concurrently.

acute_hepatitis_b_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis B in an Elderly Patient
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, falls, and dark urine
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including CCF was admitted following a fall. Initial assessment revealed jaundice and an ALT of 850 U/L; serology confirmed acute HBV, likely acquired via a previous contaminated medical procedure abroad. Her course was complicated by AKI and hospital-acquired pneumonia, but her liver function slowly improved with supportive care.

acute_hepatitis_b_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild/Anicteric Acute Hepatitis B
  presenting_complaint: Persistent fatigue and "flu-like" symptoms
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old university student presented with three weeks of unexplained tiredness. There was no clinical jaundice, but LFTs showed an isolated ALT elevation of 250 U/L. Serological screening for a "tired all the time" workup revealed positive HBsAg and IgM anti-HBc, representing a mild, anicteric case of acute HBV that resolved without intervention.

acute_hepatitis_b_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis B with Aplastic Anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice followed by easy bruising and epistaxis
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male developed typical acute hepatitis B (ALT 1800 U/L). However, during the recovery phase, he developed severe pancytopenia. Bone marrow biopsy confirmed hepatitis-associated aplastic anaemia, a rare but life-threatening complication, requiring intensive immunosuppression and haematological support.

acute_hepatitis_b_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis B in a Patient with Alcohol Use Disorder
  presenting_complaint: RUQ pain, ascites, and jaundice
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male with heavy alcohol intake presented with what was initially thought to be alcoholic hepatitis. However, an extremely high ALT (3500 U/L) prompted viral screening, which returned positive for acute HBV. The combination of alcohol-related damage and acute viral infection led to transient decompensation with ascites, managed with diuretics and Entecavir.

acute_hepatitis_b_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis B Diagnostic Challenge (Occult)
  presenting_complaint: Severe hepatitis symptoms but HBsAg negative
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female presented with jaundice and ALT 1200 U/L. Initial HBsAg was negative, but clinical suspicion remained high. Further testing for IgM anti-HBc was strongly positive and HBV DNA was 5 log10 IU/mL, confirming acute HBV in the "window period" where HBsAg has cleared but anti-HBs has not yet appeared.

acute_hepatitis_b_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis B with Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)
  presenting_complaint: Decreased urine output and jaundice
  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old male with severe acute HBV (Bilirubin 300 µmol/L) developed Stage 2 AKI secondary to hepatorenal syndrome and dehydration. He was admitted for fluid resuscitation and close monitoring of his renal and hepatic function. His renal function recovered as the hepatitis settled, avoiding the need for haemodialysis.

acute_hepatitis_b_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis B following Tattooing
  presenting_complaint: Nausea and jaundice four months after a tattoo
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old female presented with classic hepatitis symptoms. History revealed a tattoo obtained at an unlicensed premises four months prior. Investigations confirmed acute HBV (ALT 1600 U/L, HBsAg+). Public health was notified for contact tracing, and the patient made a full clinical recovery within eight weeks.
