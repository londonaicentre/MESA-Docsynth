budd_chiari_syndrome_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Budd-Chiari Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset right upper quadrant pain and abdominal distension.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female on the combined oral contraceptive pill presented with acute RUQ pain and rapid-onset ascites. Doppler ultrasound revealed complete occlusion of the three main hepatic veins with a congested "nutmeg" liver appearance. She was started on low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and transitioned to warfarin, showing significant resolution of symptoms within two weeks.

budd_chiari_syndrome_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Budd-Chiari Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Progressive abdominal swelling and prominent veins on the chest wall.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with a history of Polycythaemia Vera (JAK2 positive) presented with chronic ascites and visible thoraco-abdominal collateral veins. CT venogram confirmed chronic hepatic vein thrombosis with caudate lobe hypertrophy and secondary portal hypertension. Management involved long-term anticoagulation, venesection for his underlying myeloproliferative disorder, and diuretics for volume control.

budd_chiari_syndrome_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Fulminant Budd-Chiari Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice, confusion, and severe abdominal pain.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female presented with hyperacute liver failure, characterised by Grade 3 encephalopathy and an INR of 4.8. Investigations confirmed total hepatic venous outflow obstruction and massive hepatic necrosis. Due to rapid deterioration and meeting King's College criteria, she underwent an emergency orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) with successful recovery.

budd_chiari_syndrome_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute Budd-Chiari Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Mild jaundice and increasing abdominal girth over six weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male with previously undiagnosed Factor V Leiden mutation presented with subacute liver dysfunction and moderate ascites. Imaging showed partial thrombus in the middle and right hepatic veins. He was managed with catheter-directed thrombolysis followed by angioplasty and stenting of the hepatic veins, resulting in improved venous outflow.

budd_chiari_syndrome_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Budd-Chiari Syndrome secondary to IVC Web
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral leg oedema and hepatomegaly.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female of East Asian descent presented with long-standing lower limb swelling and hepatomegaly. Cavography identified a membranous web in the suprahepatic Inferior Vena Cava (IVC). She underwent successful percutaneous balloon dilatation of the web, leading to immediate reduction in venous pressures and resolution of oedema.

budd_chiari_syndrome_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Pregnancy-related Budd-Chiari Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting three days postpartum.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old primiparous woman developed severe RUQ pain shortly after an emergency Caesarean section. Doppler studies confirmed acute thrombosis of the left and middle hepatic veins, likely exacerbated by the prothrombotic state of the puerperium. She was successfully treated with heparin anticoagulation and remained stable on long-term follow-up.

budd_chiari_syndrome_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Budd-Chiari Syndrome with Refractory Ascites
  presenting_complaint: Persistent abdominal bloating despite high-dose diuretics.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male with chronic BCS and Protein S deficiency presented with diuretic-resistant ascites requiring frequent paracentesis. Despite optimal anticoagulation, his liver function remained borderline. He underwent a Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) procedure, which significantly reduced the portal pressure gradient and controlled the ascites.

budd_chiari_syndrome_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary Budd-Chiari Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss and new-onset ascites.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male with known Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) presented with sudden liver congestion. Imaging revealed the tumour thrombus had extended from the renal vein into the IVC, obstructing the hepatic vein orifices. Given the advanced stage of his malignancy, management was focused on palliative care and symptom control for his ascites.

budd_chiari_syndrome_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic Budd-Chiari Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding on routine imaging.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female underwent a CT abdomen for suspected diverticulitis, which incidentally showed an occluded right hepatic vein and large intrahepatic collaterals. Liver function tests and physical examination were entirely normal, suggesting a long-standing, well-compensated chronic occlusion. She was placed on aspirin and monitored regularly with no intervention required.

budd_chiari_syndrome_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Budd-Chiari Syndrome in Behçet's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent oral ulcers and sudden painful hepatomegaly.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male with a history of Behçet's disease presented with an acute flare and RUQ pain. Investigations confirmed hepatic vein thrombosis as a vasculitic complication. Treatment involved a combination of high-dose corticosteroids, immunosuppression with azathioprine, and anticoagulation, leading to clinical stabilisation.

budd_chiari_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic Budd-Chiari Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of pre-existing ascites and haematemesis.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old patient with known chronic BCS due to Antiphospholipid Syndrome presented with acute decompensation. Endoscopy revealed bleeding oesophageal varices, and imaging showed new thrombus formation in the previously patent left hepatic vein. He was managed with endoscopic band ligation, intensified anticoagulation, and eventually listed for liver transplantation.

budd_chiari_syndrome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Budd-Chiari Syndrome secondary to PNH
  presenting_complaint: Dark-coloured urine and abdominal pain.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male presented with episodic haemoglobinuria and acute RUQ pain. Flow cytometry confirmed Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria (PNH), and MRI showed acute hepatic vein thrombosis. He was treated with Eculizumab and anticoagulation, which halted the haemolysis and prevented further thrombotic events.

budd_chiari_syndrome_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Budd-Chiari Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Failure to thrive and abdominal distension.
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old boy presented with progressive hepatosplenomegaly and growth retardation. Investigations revealed idiopathic hepatic vein occlusion with significant portal hypertension. He underwent a Meso-atrial shunt procedure to bypass the obstruction, resulting in improved liver function and catch-up growth over the following year.

budd_chiari_syndrome_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Budd-Chiari Syndrome with Hepatorenal Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Reduced urine output and severe jaundice.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female with acute-on-chronic BCS developed Type 1 hepatorenal syndrome (HRS-AKI). She was admitted to the ICU for vasopressor support and albumin infusions. Following stabilisation of her renal function with Terlipressin, a TIPS was successfully placed, providing a bridge to liver transplantation.

budd_chiari_syndrome_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Budd-Chiari Syndrome with Stent Failure
  presenting_complaint: Recurrence of ascites and RUQ pain 6 months post-procedure.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male with a previous hepatic vein stent for BCS presented with returning symptoms. Venography confirmed in-stent restenosis due to neointimal hyperplasia. The obstruction was successfully treated with balloon angioplasty and the placement of a covered stent-graft, restoring venous flow.

budd_chiari_syndrome_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Budd-Chiari Syndrome (Small Vessel Disease)
  presenting_complaint: Ascites and pruritus.
  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old female presented with signs of portal hypertension but patent major hepatic veins on Doppler. A liver biopsy demonstrated characteristic "nutmeg" congestion and centrilobular necrosis, confirming small-vessel Budd-Chiari syndrome. She was managed medically with anticoagulation and diuretics, as she was not a candidate for radiological decompression.

budd_chiari_syndrome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Budd-Chiari Syndrome secondary to Trauma
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal pain following a road traffic accident.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male sustained blunt abdominal trauma resulting in a large intrahepatic haematoma. The haematoma caused extrinsic compression of the retrohepatic IVC and hepatic vein confluence, leading to acute BCS symptoms. Surgical evacuation of the haematoma and repair of the liver laceration resolved the venous obstruction.

budd_chiari_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Budd-Chiari Syndrome in Myelofibrosis
  presenting_complaint: Massive splenomegaly and early satiety.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with primary myelofibrosis developed sudden ascites. Imaging showed thrombosis of the portal vein extending into the hepatic veins. Due to his advanced age and underlying haematological malignancy, he was managed with cautious anticoagulation and Ruxolitinib, focusing on symptom management rather than aggressive intervention.

budd_chiari_syndrome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Budd-Chiari Syndrome with Oesophageal Variceal Bleed
  presenting_complaint: Massive haematemesis and shock.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female with undiagnosed Protein C deficiency presented in hypovolaemic shock. After resuscitation and haemostasis via band ligation, CT confirmed chronic BCS with extensive varices. She was subsequently anticoagulated and underwent elective TIPS to prevent recurrent haemorrhage.

budd_chiari_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome (CAPS)
  presenting_complaint: Multi-organ failure including liver, renal, and respiratory distress.
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old female with known SLE presented with widespread microvascular thrombosis, including acute Budd-Chiari syndrome. She required ICU admission for ventilation and continuous veno-venous haemofiltration. Treatment involved a combination of plasma exchange, high-dose steroids, and IV heparin, but she unfortunately succumbed to multi-organ failure.
