cataract_001:
  primary_diagnosis: nuclear sclerotic cataract
  presenting_complaint: gradual decline in distance vision and difficulty driving at night due to glare
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male presented to his optometrist with a 2-year history of progressive blurring. Clinical examination revealed 2+ nuclear sclerosis bilaterally with visual acuity of 6/12. He was referred for routine outpatient phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation, which proceeded without complication.

cataract_002:
  primary_diagnosis: cortical cataract
  presenting_complaint: significant glare and monocular diplopia in the left eye
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female with type 2 diabetes presented with peripheral opacities noted on slit-lamp biomicroscopy. The cortical spokes were encroaching on the visual axis, reducing acuity to 6/18. She underwent successful cataract extraction with a multifocal lens replacement in the community hospital setting.

cataract_003:
  primary_diagnosis: posterior subcapsular cataract
  presenting_complaint: rapid reduction in near vision and severe photophobia
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male on long-term systemic prednisolone for asthma reported a 6-month decline in vision. Examination showed a dense plaque-like opacity on the posterior lens capsule. Despite his younger age, the functional impact necessitated early surgical intervention, resulting in a return to 6/6 vision.

cataract_004:
  primary_diagnosis: bilateral congenital cataracts
  presenting_complaint: white reflex in both pupils and lack of visual tracking
  summary_of_course: A 3-month-old infant was referred by a paediatrician after the mother noticed leukocoria. Urgent ophthalmic assessment confirmed dense central lens opacities obstructing the visual axis. The patient underwent bilateral lensectomies and anterior vitrectomies to prevent irreversible amblyopia, followed by aphakic contact lens fitting.

cataract_005:
  primary_diagnosis: traumatic cataract
  presenting_complaint: sudden loss of vision following a blunt injury to the right eye
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old construction worker was struck by a bungee cord, leading to immediate visual blurring. Slit-lamp exam revealed a "stellate" or rosette-shaped lens opacity and mild phacodonesis. He was managed with urgent surgical extraction and a sulcus-fixated intraocular lens due to zonular instability.

cataract_006:
  primary_diagnosis: diabetic snowflake cataract
  presenting_complaint: acute onset of bilateral clouding of vision over three weeks
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with poorly controlled Type 1 diabetes (HbA1c 98 mmol/mol) presented with rapid-onset subcapsular clearings. These "snowflake" opacities progressed quickly to total lens opacification. Following stabilisation of his glycaemic control, he underwent bilateral sequential cataract surgery.

cataract_007:
  primary_diagnosis: phacolytic glaucoma
  presenting_complaint: acute painful red eye with associated nausea and vomiting
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old female with a neglected hypermature cataract presented to A&E with an intraocular pressure of 52 mmHg. Slit-lamp examination showed a wrinkled lens capsule and heavy protein flare in the anterior chamber. She was treated with intravenous acetazolamide followed by emergency cataract extraction to resolve the inflammatory glaucoma.

cataract_008:
  primary_diagnosis: phacomorphic glaucoma
  presenting_complaint: sudden ocular pain and frontal headache
  summary_of_course: An elderly patient with a known intumescent (swollen) cataract presented with acute angle closure. The anteroposterior diameter of the lens had increased significantly, pushing the iris forward and occluding the drainage angle. Following laser peripheral iridotomy, the patient underwent phacoemulsification to remove the causative lens.

cataract_009:
  primary_diagnosis: paediatric cataract in Down's syndrome
  presenting_complaint: progressive squint and rubbing of eyes
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy with Trisomy 21 was noted to have bilateral symmetrical lens opacities during a routine screening. The cataracts were cerulean (blue-dot) in type but had become dense enough to interfere with schoolwork. Surgery was performed under general anaesthesia with a focus on meticulous postoperative inflammation management.

cataract_010:
  primary_diagnosis: complicated cataract secondary to chronic uveitis
  presenting_complaint: misty vision and floaters
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female with a history of HLA-B27 positive anterior uveitis developed a dense cataract following multiple inflammatory episodes. Posterior synechiae were present, requiring iris hooks during the surgical procedure to achieve adequate pupillary dilatation. The surgery was delayed until the eye had been "quiet" for three months on topical steroids.

cataract_011:
  primary_diagnosis: morgagnian cataract
  presenting_complaint: total loss of vision in the right eye, perceiving only light
  summary_of_course: A 90-year-old patient from a residential care home presented with a hypermature cataract where the nucleus had subsided into the liquefied cortex. Ultrasound B-scan was performed to rule out retinal detachment behind the opaque lens. A manual small-incision cataract surgery (MSICS) was performed due to the extreme hardness of the nucleus.

cataract_012:
  primary_diagnosis: posterior polar cataract
  presenting_complaint: chronic blurring and dissatisfaction with glasses
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male presented with a well-defined circular opacity on the central posterior capsule. This congenital variant posed a high risk of posterior capsule rupture during surgery. The surgeon employed a "no-hydrodissection" technique, but a small rent occurred, requiring limited anterior vitrectomy and sulcus lens placement.

cataract_013:
  primary_diagnosis: pseudoexfoliative cataract
  presenting_complaint: gradual visual loss and poor pupillary dilation
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old male of Scandinavian descent showed white flaky material on the anterior lens capsule and pupillary margin. During phacoemulsification, significant zonular weakness was encountered, necessitating the use of a capsular tension ring (CTR) to stabilise the bag. The patient achieved a good visual outcome despite the increased surgical complexity.

cataract_014:
  primary_diagnosis: post-vitrectomy cataract
  presenting_complaint: rapid darkening of vision six months after retinal surgery
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female who previously underwent pars plana vitrectomy for a macular hole developed a dense nuclear sclerotic cataract. This is a common sequela of vitrectomy due to increased oxygen tension. Surgery was technically challenging due to the lack of vitreous support, but she recovered 6/9 vision.

cataract_015:
  primary_diagnosis: early-onset nuclear cataract with high myopia
  presenting_complaint: worsening distance vision and increasing "near-sightedness"
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male with -10.00D myopia reported a "second sight" phenomenon where he could suddenly read without glasses. This myopic shift was caused by increasing lenticular refractive power from early nuclear sclerosis. He underwent refractive lens exchange with a monofocal IOL tailored to his axial length.

cataract_016:
  primary_diagnosis: radiation-induced cataract
  presenting_complaint: painless blurring in the left eye following oncological treatment
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old patient who received localised radiotherapy for a sinus tumour three years prior developed a posterior subcapsular opacity. The radiation dose to the lens was estimated at 10 Gy. He was managed with routine phacoemulsification, though the surgeon monitored for potential corneal endothelial damage from prior radiation.

cataract_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Christmas tree cataract
  presenting_complaint: mild visual disturbance and muscle weakness
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female with myotonic dystrophy was found to have highly refractive, multi-coloured crystals within the lens cortex. While initially asymptomatic, the opacities eventually coalesced into a more traditional stellate cataract. She was referred for surgery when her visual acuity dropped to 6/12, with careful anaesthetic planning due to her systemic condition.

cataract_018:
  primary_diagnosis: cataract with Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy
  presenting_complaint: morning blurring that improves throughout the day
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female presented with both a moderate cataract and significant corneal guttata. There was concern that phacoemulsification energy would trigger permanent corneal decompensation. A "soft-shell" viscoelastic technique was used to protect the endothelium, and she was counselled regarding the potential future need for a corneal transplant.

cataract_019:
  primary_diagnosis: ectopia lentis with cataract
  presenting_complaint: fluctuating vision and distorted images
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male with Marfan syndrome presented with a superiorly subluxated lens that had developed secondary opacification. The lens was mobile, and the zonular dehiscence exceeded 180 degrees. He required a complex lensectomy with an iris-claw intraocular lens because the capsular bag could not be preserved.

cataract_020:
  primary_diagnosis: intumescent white cataract
  presenting_complaint: sudden "white appearance" of the pupil and total loss of detail
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female presented with a mature white cataract and a shallow anterior chamber. To prevent the "Argentinian Flag Sign" (spontaneous capsular tear), the surgeon used trypan blue to stain the capsule and a needle aspiration technique to decompress the lens before capsulorhexis. The procedure was successful with a standard IOL implant.
