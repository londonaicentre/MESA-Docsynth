  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent Native Cyst Infection (Post-Transplant)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent fevers and malaise five years post-renal transplant
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female, five years post-deceased donor renal transplant for ADPKD, presented with recurrent episodes of sepsis. Investigations identified the native left polycystic kidney as the source of repeated infections. She underwent a planned native bilateral nephrectomy, which successfully halted the recurrent febrile episodes without compromising the transplant graft.

ad_polycystic_kidney_disease_011:
  primary_diagnosis: ADPKD in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Routine obstetric review with rising blood pressure
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old primigravida with known ADPKD and baseline normal renal function presented at 26 weeks gestation with a BP of 150/95 mmHg. She was monitored closely for pre-eclampsia; however, her proteinuria remained stable and her eGFR stayed above 80 ml/min/1.73m². She delivered a healthy infant at 37 weeks via induced vaginal delivery with no maternal complications.

  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Pain Syndrome in ADPKD
  presenting_complaint: Debilitating chronic loin and back pain
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with massive polycystic kidneys (total kidney volume >3000ml) reported a constant, dull ache that prevented him from working. After failing conservative management with the pain clinic and WHO analgesic ladder, he was evaluated for laparoscopic cyst decortication. Due to the severity of the pain and kidney size, he eventually underwent a unilateral nephrectomy which provided significant symptomatic relief.

ad_polycystic_kidney_disease_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Rapidly Progressing ADPKD
  presenting_complaint: Significant decline in renal function over 12 months
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male with ADPKD (Mayo Class 1E) showed an eGFR decline from 75 to 62 ml/min/1.73m² within one year. Following NICE guidelines, he was commenced on Tolvaptan to slow the rate of cyst growth and renal decline. He requires monthly liver function test monitoring and has managed the resulting aquaresis by increasing fluid intake to 4 litres daily.

ad_polycystic_kidney_disease_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic Kidney Injury
  presenting_complaint: Reduced urine output and confusion following gastroenteritis
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with ADPKD and baseline CKD stage 4 (eGFR 22) presented with severe dehydration after a viral diarrhoeal illness. His creatinine had risen from 240 µmol/L to 510 µmol/L, and he was hyperkalaemic at 6.4 mmol/L. Following intravenous fluid resuscitation and temporary cessation of his ACE inhibitor, his renal function returned to baseline over five days.

  primary_diagnosis: Acute Diverticulitis in ADPKD
  presenting_complaint: Left lower quadrant abdominal pain and altered bowel habit
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female with ADPKD presented with acute left iliac fossa pain and fever. A CT scan confirmed acute sigmoid diverticulitis without perforation, a condition known to have a higher prevalence in the ADPKD population. She was successfully treated with bowel rest and intravenous Co-amoxiclav.

ad_polycystic_kidney_disease_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Late-Onset ADPKD (Mild Phenotype)
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding on CT during weight loss investigation
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male was found to have bilateral renal cysts and hepatic cysts on a CT thorax/abdomen/pelvis performed for unexplained weight loss. Despite the presence of multiple cysts, his eGFR was 68 ml/min/1.73m² and he had no history of hypertension. Genetic counselling suggested a likely PKD2 mutation, explaining the milder, slower-progressing clinical phenotype.

ad_polycystic_kidney_disease_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Pre-emptive Renal Transplant Candidate
  presenting_complaint: Preparation for renal replacement therapy
  summary_of_course: A 43-year-old female with ADPKD and an eGFR of 14 ml/min/1.73m² was referred for transplant workup. Her brother, who does not carry the PKD gene, was identified as a compatible living donor. She is currently undergoing final immunological cross-matching for a pre-emptive transplant to avoid the need for dialysis.

  primary_diagnosis: Renal Cell Carcinoma in Polycystic Kidney
  presenting_complaint: Unexplained weight loss and worsening anaemia
  summary_of_course: A 56-year-old male with ADPKD and CKD stage 4 presented with a 5kg weight loss and a drop in haemoglobin to 92 g/L. An MRI of the kidneys revealed a solid, enhancing 3.5cm mass within the lower pole of the right polycystic kidney, suspicious for RCC. He underwent a radical nephrectomy, and histology confirmed a clear cell renal cell carcinoma, T1bN0M0.

ad_polycystic_kidney_disease_019:
  primary_diagnosis: ADPKD with Mitral Valve Prolapse
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations and atypical chest pain
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female with known ADPKD presented to the cardiology clinic with intermittent palpitations. An echocardiogram revealed mitral valve prolapse with mild mitral regurgitation, an extra-renal manifestation of her condition. Her symptoms were managed with low-dose Propranolol, and she remains under periodic cardiac surveillance.

ad_polycystic_kidney_disease_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Abdominal Wall Hernia secondary to Organomegaly
  presenting_complaint: Large, reducible umbilical swelling
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with massive ADPKD kidneys (combined volume >4500ml) presented with a symptomatic umbilical hernia. The hernia was attributed to chronically raised intra-abdominal pressure caused by the extreme kidney size. He underwent an elective mesh repair, though he was cautioned regarding the risk of recurrence due to the persistent mass effect of his kidneys.
