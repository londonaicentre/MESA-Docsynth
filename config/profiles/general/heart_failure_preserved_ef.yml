heart_failure_preserved_ef_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive exertional dyspnoea and bilateral ankle swelling.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old female with long-standing hypertension and obesity (BMI 34) presented to the community clinic with NYHA Class II symptoms. Investigations revealed an NT-proBNP of 850 pg/mL and an echocardiogram showing an LVEF of 58% with significant left atrial enlargement and impaired diastolic filling (E/e' 15). She was started on Empagliflozin and low-dose Furosemide, resulting in symptomatic improvement and weight reduction.

heart_failure_preserved_ef_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic HFpEF
  presenting_complaint: Acute shortness of breath and orthopnoea following a respiratory tract infection.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with known HFpEF and COPD was admitted to the medical assessment unit with increased respiratory distress. Clinical examination noted bibasal crackles and raised JVP, while chest X-ray confirmed pulmonary venous congestion. He was treated with intravenous Furosemide and titrated up on his Spironolactone, returning to baseline after four days of inpatient care.

heart_failure_preserved_ef_003:
  primary_diagnosis: HFpEF secondary to Atrial Fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations, lethargy, and reduced exercise tolerance.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) presented with worsening breathlessness. ECG confirmed AF with a rapid ventricular response; echocardiography showed an LVEF of 55% but high filling pressures during the arrhythmia. Management focused on rate control with Bisoprolol and anticoagulation, alongside SGLT2 inhibition, which stabilised her cardiac function.

heart_failure_preserved_ef_004:
  primary_diagnosis: HFpEF with Hypertensive Emergency
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset "flash" pulmonary oedema and severe headache.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male presented to A&E with a blood pressure of 210/115 mmHg and acute respiratory failure. Despite a preserved LVEF of 62%, he had severe diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary congestion on imaging. He required urgent intravenous nitrates and CPAP in the high dependency unit before transitioning to oral Ramipril and Amlodipine for long-term pressure control.

heart_failure_preserved_ef_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Cardiac Amyloidosis (HFpEF phenotype)
  presenting_complaint: Unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and peripheral oedema.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male was referred to cardiology for suspected HFpEF after failing to respond to standard diuretics. Echocardiography showed marked concentric ventricular thickening with a "sparkling" myocardial appearance and a preserved EF of 52%. Further investigations, including a DPD scan and serum free light chains, confirmed transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), necessitating specialist amyloid-directed therapy.

heart_failure_preserved_ef_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild HFpEF in Type 2 Diabetes
  presenting_complaint: Mild breathlessness when walking uphill and nocturia.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male with poorly controlled Type 2 Diabetes and Stage 3a CKD was screened for heart failure. NT-proBNP was mildly elevated at 400 pg/mL, and a stress echocardiogram demonstrated exercise-induced elevation of LV filling pressures despite a normal resting EF. He was commenced on Dapagliflozin, which improved both his glycaemic control and exertional symptoms.

heart_failure_preserved_ef_007:
  primary_diagnosis: HFpEF with Cardiorenal Syndrome Type 2
  presenting_complaint: Refractory fluid overload and rising creatinine levels.
  summary_of_course: An 81-year-old female with chronic HFpEF and Stage 4 CKD presented with gross ascites and pitting oedema to the mid-thigh. Aggressive diuresis was complicated by worsening renal function, requiring a delicate balance of intravenous Bumetanide and Metolazone. She was eventually stabilised on a complex diuretic regimen with close monitoring by the heart failure and nephrology multidisciplinary team.

heart_failure_preserved_ef_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Exercise-induced HFpEF
  presenting_complaint: Breathlessness only during vigorous activity, normal at rest.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female, previously an avid hiker, reported significant dyspnoea on inclines. Initial resting Echo and NT-proBNP were borderline; however, an invasive exercise haemodynamic study (right heart cath) confirmed a rapid rise in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure during exertion. She was diagnosed with early-stage HFpEF and managed with lifestyle modifications and a trial of Candesartan.

heart_failure_preserved_ef_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Advanced HFpEF (NYHA IV)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent breathlessness at rest and severe frailty.
  summary_of_course: An 89-year-old male with multiple comorbidities and long-standing HFpEF reached a stage of diuretic resistance. Despite optimal medical therapy including SGLT2i and MRA, he experienced frequent hospitalisations for decompensation. Following a multidisciplinary review, the focus of care was shifted to palliative symptom management with low-dose Morphine and community heart failure nurse support.

heart_failure_preserved_ef_010:
  primary_diagnosis: HFpEF associated with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA)
  presenting_complaint: Daytime somnolence, snoring, and morning headaches with mild oedema.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old obese male (BMI 38) was found to have HFpEF (LVEF 57%) during a workup for hypertension. A sleep study confirmed severe OSA (AHI 45), which was contributing to nocturnal hypoxia and right-sided heart strain. Treatment with CPAP therapy significantly reduced his nocturnal filling pressures and improved his overall NYHA functional class.

heart_failure_preserved_ef_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-chemotherapy HFpEF
  presenting_complaint: New onset fatigue and breathlessness 5 years post-cancer treatment.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female breast cancer survivor, previously treated with Anthracyclines and chest wall radiotherapy, presented with HFpEF symptoms. While her LVEF remained 54%, global longitudinal strain was reduced, and diastolic parameters were abnormal. She was started on Losartan and Carvedilol, showing a gradual improvement in her functional capacity over six months.

heart_failure_preserved_ef_012:
  primary_diagnosis: HFpEF exacerbated by Iron Deficiency Anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Extreme lethargy, palpitations, and breathlessness.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female with known HFpEF presented with an exacerbation of symptoms; bloods showed a haemoglobin of 92 g/L and ferritin of 12 ug/L. The anaemia was identified as a major precipitant of her high-output state and diastolic dysfunction. Following an intravenous iron carboxymaltose infusion, her exercise tolerance and NT-proBNP levels improved significantly.

heart_failure_preserved_ef_013:
  primary_diagnosis: HFpEF with Valvular Heart Disease
  presenting_complaint: Syncope on exertion and orthopnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old male was found to have a combination of mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis and HFpEF. The stiffened left ventricle from HFpEF was unable to compensate for the valvular pressure overload, leading to rapid decompensation. He was managed medically with diuretics and SGLT2i while being monitored for progression of his valvular disease for potential TAVI.

heart_failure_preserved_ef_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Restrictive Cardiomyopathy (HFpEF phenotype)
  presenting_complaint: Poor weight gain, tachypnoea, and hepatomegaly in a child.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old girl presented with signs of heart failure despite a normal LVEF of 65%. Echocardiography and MRI confirmed a restrictive cardiomyopathy pattern with massive biatrial enlargement and restricted ventricular filling. She was diagnosed with a genetic variant causing a HFpEF-like physiology and was listed for cardiac transplantation due to the severity of her restrictive physiology.

heart_failure_preserved_ef_015:
  primary_diagnosis: HFpEF in a Patient with Liver Cirrhosis
  presenting_complaint: Increasing abdominal girth and lower limb oedema.
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis presented with what was initially thought to be simple ascites. However, elevated JVP and NT-proBNP of 1200 pg/mL suggested a cardiac component; Echo confirmed HFpEF (LVEF 60%) with high cardiac output. Management required careful titration of Spironolactone to treat both his cirrhosis and his diastolic heart failure.

heart_failure_preserved_ef_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Decompensated HFpEF in the ICU
  presenting_complaint: Septic shock and respiratory failure.
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old male with pre-existing HFpEF was admitted to the ICU with urosepsis. The inflammatory response and fluid resuscitation triggered severe diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary oedema despite a preserved EF. He required cautious fluid management, vasopressors, and high-flow nasal oxygen, with his HFpEF medications resumed once he was haemodynamically stable.

heart_failure_preserved_ef_017:
  primary_diagnosis: HFpEF with Metabolic Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath and inability to perform activities of daily living.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female with BMI 42, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia presented with NYHA Class III symptoms. Investigations showed an LVEF of 59%, concentric LV hypertrophy, and an E/e' of 18. A comprehensive management plan including a very-low-calorie diet, SGLT2 inhibition, and intensive BP control led to a 15kg weight loss and significant improvement in cardiac filling pressures.

heart_failure_preserved_ef_018:
  primary_diagnosis: HFpEF with Right Ventricular Dysfunction
  presenting_complaint: Significant peripheral oedema, pulsatile neck veins, and fatigue.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with long-standing HFpEF (LVEF 55%) developed secondary pulmonary hypertension and subsequent right ventricular (RV) dilatation. This "biventricular" HFpEF presentation made him highly sensitive to fluid shifts. He was managed with a combination of Furosemide and Acetazolamide to overcome diuretic resistance, alongside optimized HFpEF therapy.

heart_failure_preserved_ef_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute HFpEF following Viral Myocarditis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent chest tightness and breathlessness after a viral illness.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male developed HFpEF symptoms three months after a confirmed viral myocarditis episode. While his LVEF had recovered to 55%, cardiac MRI showed persistent myocardial fibrosis and restrictive filling patterns. He was treated with an ACE inhibitor and Spironolactone, with gradual resolution of symptoms over the following year.

heart_failure_preserved_ef_020:
  primary_diagnosis: HFpEF Diagnostic Challenge (Obesity Masking)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic cough and breathlessness, previously treated as asthma.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with a BMI of 45 had been treated for "refractory asthma" for two years without success. A specialist review noted a raised NT-proBNP (600 pg/mL) and an echocardiogram (technically difficult due to body habitus) finally confirmed HFpEF with an EF of 63%. Switching from inhalers to diuretics and SGLT2 inhibitors provided immediate relief of her "asthma" symptoms.
