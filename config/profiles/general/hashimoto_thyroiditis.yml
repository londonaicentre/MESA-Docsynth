hashimoto_thyroiditis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Autoimmune Thyroiditis
  presenting_complaint: Progressive fatigue, weight gain of 5kg, and cold intolerance over six months.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female presented to her GP with classic hypothyroid symptoms and a firm, non-tender goitre. Blood tests revealed a TSH of 45 mU/L, Free T4 of 8.2 pmol/L, and strongly positive anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies (>600 IU/mL). She was commenced on Levothyroxine 75mcg daily, with titration to 125mcg resulting in biochemical euthyroidism and symptom resolution.

hashimoto_thyroiditis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Myxoedema Coma
  presenting_complaint: Reduced level of consciousness, hypothermia, and bradycardia.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with known but untreated Hashimoto thyroiditis was admitted to the ICU after being found collapsed at home during a cold spell. Investigations showed TSH 112 mU/L, Free T4 undetectable, and a core temperature of 32.2°C. He was treated with intravenous liothyronine, hydrocortisone, and gradual rewarming, eventually transitioning to oral levothyroxine.

hashimoto_thyroiditis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Hashimoto Thyroiditis
  presenting_complaint: Growth retardation and delayed onset of puberty.
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old girl was referred to paediatrics due to falling across height centiles and persistent constipation. Laboratory findings confirmed primary hypothyroidism with TSH 68 mU/L and positive TPO antibodies, consistent with Hashimoto's. Levothyroxine therapy was initiated, leading to catch-up growth and normalisation of pubertal progression over the following year.

hashimoto_thyroiditis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Hashitoxicosis
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations, heat intolerance, and anxiety followed by profound lethargy.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female initially presented with symptoms of thyrotoxicosis and a suppressed TSH (0.05 mU/L) with elevated Free T4. Within eight weeks, her clinical picture shifted to overt hypothyroidism with TSH rising to 55 mU/L and high TPO antibody titres. This transient hyperthyroid phase of Hashimoto thyroiditis resolved into permanent hypothyroidism requiring life-long replacement.

hashimoto_thyroiditis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Steroid-Responsive Encephalopathy Associated with Autoimmune Thyroiditis (SREAT)
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of confusion, visual hallucinations, and cognitive decline.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female presented with neuropsychiatric symptoms and a TSH of 12 mU/L. Despite mild hypothyroidism, her TPO antibodies were extremely high (>2000 IU/mL) and MRI brain was unremarkable. She was diagnosed with Hashimoto’s encephalopathy and showed dramatic clinical improvement following high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone.

hashimoto_thyroiditis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndrome Type 2 (Schmidt Syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Dizziness, skin hyperpigmentation, and lethargy.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male with established Type 1 Diabetes presented with hypotension and hyponatraemia. Investigations confirmed primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease) alongside Hashimoto thyroiditis (TSH 22 mU/L, TPO positive). He required complex management with hydrocortisone, fludrocortisone, and cautious levothyroxine replacement to avoid precipitating an adrenal crisis.

hashimoto_thyroiditis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Gestational Hashimoto Thyroiditis
  presenting_complaint: Routine antenatal screening showing abnormal thyroid function.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female at 10 weeks gestation was found to have a TSH of 8.4 mU/L and positive TPO antibodies. Given the risks of neurodevelopmental delays and miscarriage, she was promptly started on Levothyroxine 50mcg. Regular monitoring throughout pregnancy ensured TSH remained below 2.5 mU/L, resulting in a healthy term delivery.

hashimoto_thyroiditis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Goitrous Hashimoto Thyroiditis
  presenting_complaint: Visible neck swelling and a sensation of "fullness" when swallowing.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female presented with a Grade 2 diffuse goitre that was firm and bosselated on palpation. Ultrasound showed a characteristic "moth-eaten" hypoechoic texture and increased vascularity, while cytology confirmed lymphocytic infiltration. Despite being biochemically euthyroid initially, her TSH rose over 12 months, necessitating thyroxine to reduce goitre size and manage emerging hypothyroidism.

hashimoto_thyroiditis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Atrophic Thyroiditis
  presenting_complaint: Severe dry skin, hair loss, and macrocytic anaemia.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old female presented with non-specific symptoms of ageing and a TSH of 85 mU/L. Ultrasound revealed an almost absent, fibrotic thyroid gland, representing the end-stage atrophic variant of Hashimoto thyroiditis. She responded well to a modest starting dose of 25mcg levothyroxine, titrated slowly due to her history of ischaemic heart disease.

hashimoto_thyroiditis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Hashimoto Thyroiditis due to Coeliac Disease
  presenting_complaint: Persistent hypothyroid symptoms despite high doses of Levothyroxine.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female remained symptomatic with a TSH of 15 mU/L despite taking 200mcg of Levothyroxine daily. Investigations for malabsorption revealed positive tissue transglutaminase antibodies and villous atrophy on duodenal biopsy. Once a gluten-free diet was established, her levothyroxine absorption improved significantly, allowing for a dose reduction to 100mcg.

hashimoto_thyroiditis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Subclinical Hashimoto Thyroiditis
  presenting_complaint: Mild low mood and difficulty concentrating (brain fog).
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female was found to have a TSH of 6.2 mU/L with a normal Free T4 of 14.1 pmol/L and positive TPO antibodies. After a three-month trial of 25mcg Levothyroxine failed to improve her mood, therapy was paused for monitoring. She remains under annual review by her GP to detect progression to overt hypothyroidism.

hashimoto_thyroiditis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Myxoedema Madness (Psychiatric Presentation)
  presenting_complaint: Acute paranoid psychosis and persecutory delusions.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male with no psychiatric history was admitted under the Mental Health Act. Physical examination noted periorbital oedema and a slow-relaxing ankle jerk, prompting thyroid screening which showed a TSH of 98 mU/L. Treatment with levothyroxine and short-term antipsychotics led to a complete resolution of psychiatric symptoms within four weeks.

hashimoto_thyroiditis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Hashimoto Thyroiditis with Pericardial Effusion
  presenting_complaint: Exertional dyspnoea and muffled heart sounds.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old female presented to A&E with worsening shortness of breath and peripheral oedema. Echocardiography revealed a moderate-sized pericardial effusion, and bloods showed severe hypothyroidism (TSH 75 mU/L) secondary to Hashimoto's. The effusion resolved gradually over three months with thyroid hormone replacement alone, without the need for pericardiocentesis.

hashimoto_thyroiditis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Hashimoto Thyroiditis with Pernicious Anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Extreme pallor, paraesthesia in the feet, and fatigue.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female was diagnosed with Hashimoto thyroiditis (TSH 30 mU/L) alongside macrocytic anaemia (Hb 92 g/L, MCV 110 fL). Further testing confirmed low Vitamin B12 and positive gastric parietal cell antibodies. She required dual management with intramuscular B12 injections and oral levothyroxine to address her multiple autoimmune cytopenias.

hashimoto_thyroiditis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Hashimoto Thyroiditis in a Male Patient
  presenting_complaint: Erectile dysfunction, low libido, and depressed mood.
  summary_of_course: A 49-year-old male was initially investigated for low testosterone; however, his total testosterone was borderline and TSH was significantly elevated at 28 mU/L. TPO antibodies were positive, confirming Hashimoto's as the primary driver of his symptoms. Following six months of levothyroxine, his sexual function and energy levels returned to baseline.

hashimoto_thyroiditis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Lithium-Induced Exacerbation of Hashimoto Thyroiditis
  presenting_complaint: Rapid onset of weight gain and somnolence.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male on long-term lithium for bipolar disorder developed overt hypothyroidism (TSH 32 mU/L). While he had pre-existing low-titre TPO antibodies, lithium therapy appeared to trigger a significant clinical flare of his Hashimoto's. He was maintained on both lithium and levothyroxine with careful monitoring of his mental state and thyroid function.

hashimoto_thyroiditis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary Thyroid Lymphoma complicating Hashimoto's
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly enlarging, painless neck mass over three weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female with a 20-year history of Hashimoto thyroiditis presented with a sudden increase in goitre size and new-onset hoarseness. Core needle biopsy revealed a Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma arising within the background of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis. She was referred for urgent chemotherapy and radiotherapy, while continuing levothyroxine for her underlying hypothyroidism.

hashimoto_thyroiditis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Painful Hashimoto Thyroiditis
  presenting_complaint: Anterior neck pain radiating to the jaw and ears.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old female presented with symptoms mimicking subacute (De Quervain's) thyroiditis, but with a normal ESR and very high TPO antibodies. Ultrasound showed diffuse inflammation rather than the focal areas typical of viral thyroiditis. Her pain was refractory to NSAIDs but responded to a short course of prednisolone, and she eventually developed permanent hypothyroidism.

hashimoto_thyroiditis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Hashimoto-related Infertility
  presenting_complaint: Primary infertility and three early pregnancy losses.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female with regular cycles but high TPO antibodies (800 IU/mL) and a high-normal TSH of 3.8 mU/L was referred to the fertility clinic. Despite being technically euthyroid by standard lab ranges, she was started on low-dose levothyroxine to target a TSH <2.5 mU/L. She successfully conceived and maintained her next pregnancy to term.

hashimoto_thyroiditis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Adolescent Hashimoto Thyroiditis
  presenting_complaint: Declining school performance and excessive daytime sleepiness.
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old boy was brought in by his parents due to "laziness" and falling grades. Physical exam showed a small goitre and dry skin; TSH was 52 mU/L with positive anti-thyroglobulin and TPO antibodies. Levothyroxine replacement led to a significant improvement in his cognitive function and concentration, with his school reports returning to their previous high standard.
