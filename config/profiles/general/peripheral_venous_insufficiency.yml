  presenting_complaint: Severe vulval discomfort and leg varicosities in third trimester
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old multiparous female at 32 weeks gestation develops significant vulval varicosities and bilateral leg oedema. Hormonal changes and pelvic venous compression by the gravid uterus are identified as the primary drivers. Symptoms are managed with maternity support hosiery and pelvic floor exercises, with planned reassessment six months postpartum.

peripheral_venous_insufficiency_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Venous eczema (Stasis dermatitis)
  presenting_complaint: Intense itching and scaly red rash on both shins
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male presents with chronic pruritus and erythematous, scaling plaques on the lower thirds of both legs. He has underlying PVI with significant pitting oedema but no ulceration (CEAP C4a). He is treated with moderate-potency topical corticosteroids and emollients alongside Class 2 compression to address the underlying hypertension.

  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent PVI post-EVLA
  presenting_complaint: Return of bulging veins three years after laser treatment
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male presents with recurrent varicosities in the calf despite previous successful great saphenous vein ablation. Duplex ultrasound reveals neovascularisation at the saphenofemoral junction and incompetent accessory saphenous veins. He is successfully treated with ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy as a secondary intervention.

peripheral_venous_insufficiency_014:
  primary_diagnosis: PVI with comorbid congestive heart failure
  presenting_complaint: Significant bilateral leg swelling and orthopnoea
  summary_of_course: An 81-year-old male with known PVI and a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) presents with worsening oedema. The clinical challenge involves balancing compression therapy for PVI with the risk of fluid overload from rapid venous return. He is managed with low-stretch bandages and titrated diuretics under close cardiology supervision.

peripheral_venous_insufficiency_015:
  primary_diagnosis: May-Thurner Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Unilateral left leg swelling and heaviness in a young patient
  summary_of_course: A 47-year-old female presents with chronic left-sided PVI symptoms but no history of DVT. Venography reveals compression of the left common iliac vein by the right common iliac artery. She undergoes successful iliac vein stenting, which resolves her venous hypertension and prevents future thrombotic events.

peripheral_venous_insufficiency_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Atrophie blanche
  presenting_complaint: Painful, white, star-shaped scars on the ankles
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old female with chronic PVI presents with exquisitely painful, ivory-white atrophic plaques surrounded by telangiectasia. These represent areas of healed micro-infarctions due to severe cutaneous venous hypertension. Management focuses on meticulous skin protection, pain control, and high-level compression to prevent further infarctions.

peripheral_venous_insufficiency_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Phlegmasia cerulea dolens
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, massive blue swelling of the leg and severe pain
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with metastatic lung cancer and underlying PVI develops acute, total venous occlusion of the right lower limb. The leg is cyanotic, tense, and ischaemic due to high interstitial pressure. He is admitted to ICU for emergency catheter-directed thrombolysis and fasciotomies to salvage the limb.

peripheral_venous_insufficiency_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Deep venous reflux with haemosiderin staining
  presenting_complaint: Permanent brown discolouration of the lower legs
  summary_of_course: A 53-year-old female presents with extensive bilateral haemosiderin deposition (CEAP C4a) but no visible varicosities. Duplex ultrasound reveals primary deep venous incompetence in the femoral and popliteal veins rather than the superficial system. As surgical options for deep reflux are limited, she is prescribed lifelong Class 3 compression stockings.

peripheral_venous_insufficiency_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-traumatic peripheral venous insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Chronic heaviness in the right leg following a femoral fracture
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male athlete presents with PVI symptoms that developed after a severe motor vehicle accident involving a mid-shaft femoral fracture and associated venous injury. Venography shows focal stenosis of the femoral vein at the site of the previous trauma. He is managed with graduated compression and is being considered for venous angioplasty.

peripheral_venous_insufficiency_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Mixed venous and arterial insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Painful leg ulcer and cold feet
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old female smoker presents with a gaiter-zone ulcer and intermittent claudication. Ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) is 0.6, indicating significant arterial disease alongside PVI. Standard high-compression bandaging is contraindicated; she is managed with modified reduced-compression wraps (20mmHg) and referred for arterial revascularisation prior to definitive PVI treatment.
