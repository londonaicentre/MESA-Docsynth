  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with advanced age-related macular degeneration reports complex, non-threatening visual hallucinations of Victorian-dressed figures. Clinical examination and MRI brain were unremarkable for cognitive impairment or stroke. Reassurance and low-vision aids were provided, leading to a reduction in patient anxiety and improved coping.

visual_hallucinations_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Delirium Tremens
  presenting_complaint: Severe agitation, tremors, and seeing "insects crawling on the walls."
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with chronic alcohol dependency presented 48 hours after his last drink with tachycardia, diaphoresis, and vivid micropsia. He was admitted to the ICU for a Pabrinex regimen and titrated intravenous diazepam. The hallucinations resolved after five days of intensive supportive care.

  primary_diagnosis: Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent vivid hallucinations of children sitting in the living room.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male presented with fluctuating cognition, REM sleep behaviour disorder, and parkinsonism. Neuropsychological testing and DaTscan confirmed the diagnosis. He was commenced on Rivastigmine, which significantly reduced the frequency of the hallucinations without worsening his motor symptoms.

  presenting_complaint: Vivid, colourful geometric patterns and animals following a sudden collapse.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male suffered a midbrain ischaemic stroke confirmed by MRI. He subsequently developed non-distressing, "cinematic" visual hallucinations. Treatment focused on secondary stroke prevention, and the hallucinations gradually faded over several months as neural plasticity occurred.

visual_hallucinations_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Anticholinergic Toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Acute confusion and "picking at invisible objects" in the air.
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old female was admitted with urinary retention and blurred vision after taking multiple over-the-counter sleep aids containing diphenhydramine.

visual_hallucinations_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Parkinson's Disease Psychosis
  presenting_complaint: Seeing "shadowy figures" in the corner of the room at night.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with a 10-year history of Parkinson's disease experienced hallucinations after an increase in his Levodopa dose. A reduction in dopaminergic medication was attempted but worsened his tremors. Low-dose Quetiapine was successfully introduced to manage the psychosis while maintaining motor function.

visual_hallucinations_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Anti-NMDA Receptor Encephalitis
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive psychosis, visual hallucinations, and seizures.
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old female presented to A&E with bizarre behaviour and seeing "flames" that weren't there. CSF analysis showed pleocytosis and positive NMDA receptor antibodies; a pelvic MRI identified an ovarian teratoma. Following tumour resection and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, she made a near-complete recovery.

visual_hallucinations_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Occipital Lobe Epilepsy
  presenting_complaint: Brief, repetitive episodes of seeing multicoloured circles in the left visual field.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male reported stereotyped visual disturbances lasting 30 seconds, followed by a mild post-ictal headache. Sleep-deprived EEG showed spikes in the right occipital region. He was started on Lamotrigine, which resulted in complete seizure freedom and cessation of the visual phenomena.

visual_hallucinations_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Hyponatraemia
  presenting_complaint: Confusion and seeing "distorted faces" on the hospital ward.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male on thiazide diuretics presented with nausea and lethargy; serum sodium was 114 mmol/L. He reported seeing frightening faces and shadows. Slow correction of the sodium deficit in a high-dependency unit led to the resolution of his visual disturbances within 48 hours.

visual_hallucinations_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (Heidenhain Variant)
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly worsening vision and complex visual hallucinations.
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old female presented with cortical blindness and vivid hallucinations, followed by rapid cognitive decline and myoclonus. MRI showed cortical ribboning, and CSF was positive for 14-3-3 protein. The patient received palliative care and passed away six weeks after the initial presentation.

visual_hallucinations_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Narcolepsy Type 1
  presenting_complaint: Frightening visual images of a "stranger in the room" upon waking.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old student reported hypnopompic hallucinations and sleep paralysis, alongside excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. A multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) confirmed narcolepsy. Management with scheduled naps and Modafinil significantly reduced the frequency of the sleep-related hallucinations.

Following a course of intramuscular hydroxocobalamin injections, his haematological markers normalised and his psychiatric symptoms completely resolved.

visual_hallucinations_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Serotonin Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Agitation, shivering, and seeing "vivid geometric shapes."
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male was brought to A&E after taking Tramadol while already on a high-dose SSRI. He exhibited hyperreflexia, clonus, and intense visual imagery. He was treated with Cyproheptadine and supportive fluids, leading to the resolution of symptoms within 24 hours.

  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female with pre-eclampsia presented with a blood pressure of 210/120 mmHg and reported seeing "flashing patterns" and "monsters." MRI brain showed characteristic vasogenic oedema in the posterior lobes. Aggressive blood pressure management led to the reversal of both the clinical symptoms and radiological findings.
