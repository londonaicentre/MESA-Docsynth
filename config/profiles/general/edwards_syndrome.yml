edwards_syndrome_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Full Trisomy 18
  presenting_complaint: Neonatal respiratory distress and multiple dysmorphic features.
  summary_of_course: A male neonate was born at 38 weeks gestation via emergency caesarean section for foetal distress. Clinical examination revealed intrauterine growth restriction, microcephaly, clenched fists with overlapping index fingers, and rocker-bottom feet. Echocardiography confirmed a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), leading to a diagnosis of full Trisomy 18 via rapid aneuploidy testing.

edwards_syndrome_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Antenatal Edwards Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: High-risk screening results and structural anomalies on ultrasound.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old pregnant woman at 20 weeks gestation underwent a detailed foetal anomaly scan showing bilateral choroid plexus cysts, micrognathia, and a "strawberry-shaped" skull. Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) indicated a high probability of Trisomy 18, which was confirmed by amniocentesis. Following multidisciplinary counselling, the parents opted for a perinatal palliative care plan.

edwards_syndrome_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Mosaic Edwards Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Global developmental delay and failure to thrive.
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old girl with known mosaic Trisomy 18 (15% cell line) presented to the paediatric clinic for growth monitoring. She exhibits significant intellectual disability but is able to sit independently and use a few signs for communication. Management involves gastrostomy feeding for nutritional support and regular physiotherapy to manage moderate hypertonia.

edwards_syndrome_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Edwards Syndrome with Acute Bronchiolitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe cough, wheeze, and increased work of breathing.
  summary_of_course: A 3-month-old infant with Edwards syndrome was admitted to the paediatric high dependency unit with RSV-positive bronchiolitis. The patient required nasal high-flow oxygen and nasogastric feeding due to respiratory fatigue. Despite the underlying cardiac defects, the infant was successfully stabilised and discharged to community palliative services after ten days.

edwards_syndrome_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Edwards Syndrome with Oesophageal Atresia
  presenting_complaint: Excessive salivation and inability to pass a nasogastric tube.
  summary_of_course: A newborn female was noted to have polyhydramnios antenatally and presented at birth with pooling of secretions. Investigations confirmed oesophageal atresia with a distal tracheo-oesophageal fistula (TOF) alongside characteristic features of Edwards syndrome. Given the poor prognosis associated with the chromosomal abnormality, the surgical team and parents agreed on conservative management rather than high-risk corrective surgery.

edwards_syndrome_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Partial Trisomy 18
  presenting_complaint: Mild dysmorphic features and moderate developmental delay.
  summary_of_course: A 10-month-old boy was referred for genetic testing due to mild micrognathia and delayed motor milestones. Karyotyping revealed a partial trisomy of the long arm of chromosome 18, which typically presents with a less severe phenotype than full trisomy. He remains under outpatient surveillance with speech and language therapy and has no significant internal organ malformations.

edwards_syndrome_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Mosaic Edwards Syndrome with Scoliosis
  presenting_complaint: Progressive spinal curvature and difficulty sitting.
  summary_of_course: A 13-year-old girl with mosaic Edwards syndrome was reviewed in the orthopaedic clinic for severe dextroscoliosis. Radiographs showed a Cobb angle of 55 degrees, significantly impacting her lung volume and seated stability in her wheelchair. After careful anaesthetic assessment, she underwent a successful posterior spinal fusion to improve her quality of life and prevent further respiratory compromise.

edwards_syndrome_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Edwards Syndrome with Horseshoe Kidney
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and irritability.
  summary_of_course: A 6-week-old infant with Edwards syndrome presented with fever and malodorous urine. Renal ultrasound revealed a horseshoe kidney, a common association with Trisomy 18, which was predisposing the infant to stasis and infection. She was treated with intravenous antibiotics and started on low-dose prophylactic trimethoprim.

edwards_syndrome_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Mosaic Edwards Syndrome with Heart Failure
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath and peripheral oedema.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with mosaic Trisomy 18, a rare long-term survivor, presented to the adult congenital heart disease clinic with worsening exertional dyspnoea. Echocardiography showed a dilated left ventricle and moderate mitral regurgitation. He was commenced on a cautious regimen of furosemide and an ACE inhibitor, showing symptomatic improvement over several weeks.

edwards_syndrome_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Edwards Syndrome with Failure to Thrive
  presenting_complaint: Poor weight gain and persistent vomiting.
  summary_of_course: A 5-month-old infant with Edwards syndrome was admitted for nutritional assessment after falling below the 0.4th centile for weight. Investigations showed significant gastro-oesophageal reflux and poor swallow coordination. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube was placed to ensure adequate caloric intake and reduce the risk of aspiration.

edwards_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Edwards Syndrome with Neonatal Sepsis
  presenting_complaint: Lethargy, temperature instability, and poor perfusion.
  summary_of_course: A 4-day-old neonate with Edwards syndrome developed sudden onset lethargy and apnoea in the NICU. Blood cultures grew Group B Streptococcus, and the infant rapidly progressed to septic shock and multi-organ failure. Despite intensive fluid resuscitation and inotropic support, the infant died within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms.

edwards_syndrome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Edwards Syndrome with Duct-Dependent Circulation
  presenting_complaint: Cyanosis and metabolic acidosis on day 2 of life.
  summary_of_course: A newborn, initially stable, developed profound cyanosis as the ductus arteriosus began to close. Echocardiography revealed complex cyanotic heart disease including double outlet right ventricle (DORV) and pulmonary stenosis, consistent with Edwards syndrome. A prostaglandin infusion was started to maintain ductal patency while the family met with the palliative care team to discuss goals of care.

edwards_syndrome_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Edwards Syndrome with Wilms' Tumour
  presenting_complaint: Palpable abdominal mass during routine examination.
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old child with mosaic Edwards syndrome was found to have a firm, non-tender mass in the left flank. An urgent ultrasound and CT scan confirmed a large renal mass consistent with a Wilms' tumour, which is occasionally associated with Trisomy 18. The patient was referred to paediatric oncology for a tailored chemotherapy protocol, taking into account her chromosomal status.

edwards_syndrome_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Edwards Syndrome with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea
  presenting_complaint: Heavy snoring and observed apnoeic episodes during sleep.
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old boy with Edwards syndrome and significant micrognathia was referred for a sleep study. Polysomnography confirmed severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) with an oxygen desaturation index of 15 per hour. He was successfully transitioned to nocturnal CPAP therapy, which improved his daytime alertness and reduced his pulmonary artery pressures.

edwards_syndrome_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Edwards Syndrome with Pulmonary Hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Progressive cyanosis and increased work of breathing.
  summary_of_course: A 4-month-old infant with a large VSD associated with Edwards syndrome developed signs of Eisenmenger's physiology. Clinical examination showed a loud second heart sound and saturations of 82% in room air. Management was focused on palliative symptom relief with supplemental oxygen and sildenafil to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance.

edwards_syndrome_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Mosaic Edwards Syndrome with Epilepsy
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent focal seizures with secondary generalisation.
  summary_of_course: An 11-year-old girl with mosaic Trisomy 18 presented with a new onset of tonic-clonic seizures. EEG demonstrated focal epileptiform discharges in the right temporal lobe, and MRI showed non-specific white matter changes. Her seizures were well-controlled after the introduction of levetiracetam monotherapy.

edwards_syndrome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Edwards Syndrome (Intrauterine Death)
  presenting_complaint: Reduced foetal movements at 32 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old woman presented with a one-day history of reduced foetal movement; ultrasound confirmed intrauterine death. Foetal autopsy revealed multiple malformations including a diaphragmatic hernia, clenched fists, and a horseshoe kidney. Genetic analysis of foetal skin fibroblasts confirmed full Trisomy 18.

edwards_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Edwards Syndrome with Aspiration Pneumonia
  presenting_complaint: Fever, cough, and new oxygen requirement.
  summary_of_course: A 2-year-old child with Edwards syndrome and known oropharyngeal dysphagia was admitted with acute pneumonia. Chest X-ray showed right upper lobe consolidation, likely secondary to aspiration of feeds. He was treated with intravenous co-amoxiclav and a review by the Speech and Language Therapy (SALT) team resulted in a transition to exclusive gastrostomy feeding.

edwards_syndrome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Edwards Syndrome with Diaphragmatic Hernia
  presenting_complaint: Immediate postnatal respiratory failure and scaphoid abdomen.
  summary_of_course: A neonate was born at term with severe respiratory distress requiring immediate intubation. A chest X-ray confirmed a left-sided Bochdalek diaphragmatic hernia with significant mediastinal shift. Subsequent genetic testing confirmed Edwards syndrome, and after consultation with the neonatal surgical team, the decision was made to provide comfort-based care due to the poor prognosis of the combined conditions.

edwards_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Mosaic Edwards Syndrome (Adult)
  presenting_complaint: Routine health check in a residential care setting.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old woman with mosaic Edwards syndrome lives in a supported residential facility. She has profound learning disabilities, non-verbal communication, and uses a wheelchair due to severe joint contractures. Her management is focused on preventing pressure sores, managing chronic constipation, and providing a high level of social care support.
