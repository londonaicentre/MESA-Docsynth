  primary_diagnosis: Dysbaric osteonecrosis
  presenting_complaint: Dull ache in the shoulders and hips
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old professional saturation diver presented for a routine screening which revealed multiple asymptomatic lesions. Radiographic skeletal survey showed several areas of medullary osteonecrosis in the shafts of the femora and humeri, likely due to nitrogen bubble formation during decompression. He was advised to cease diving activities to prevent articular surface collapse.

osteonecrosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: HIV-associated osteonecrosis
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral hip stiffness and groin discomfort
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male on long-term antiretroviral therapy for HIV presented with insidious onset of hip pain. Investigations ruled out septic arthritis, but MRI confirmed early-stage bilateral osteonecrosis of the femoral heads. The aetiology was multifactorial, involving protease inhibitor use and chronic inflammation, managed with bisphosphonates and activity modification.

osteonecrosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Mandibular osteoradionecrosis
  presenting_complaint: Painful ulceration and foul-smelling discharge from the jaw
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male who underwent high-dose radiotherapy for oropharyngeal carcinoma five years prior presented with a pathological fracture of the mandible. Clinical examination showed extensive necrotic bone exposure and cutaneous fistulae, diagnostic of severe osteonecrosis. He required radical resection of the necrotic segment and reconstruction with a vascularised fibular free flap.

osteonecrosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) related osteonecrosis
  presenting_complaint: Multiple joint pains involving the knees and ankles
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female with SLE on high-dose dexamethasone for a lupus nephritis flare developed multifocal osteonecrosis. MRI confirmed involvement of the distal femora and proximal tibiae bilaterally. Management focused on steroid-sparing agents and surgical core decompression of the most symptomatic sites to preserve joint function.

osteonecrosis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic osteonecrosis of the lunate (Kienböck's disease)
  presenting_complaint: Weakness of grip and central wrist pain
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old manual labourer presented with chronic wrist stiffness. Imaging revealed increased density and collapse of the lunate bone, consistent with Stage IIIa osteonecrosis. He underwent a radial shortening osteotomy to reduce the load on the lunate and promote revascularisation.

osteonecrosis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Gaucher disease-associated osteonecrosis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent "bone crises" and hip pain
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old male with Type 1 Gaucher disease presented with acute femoral pain and pyrexia, mimicking osteomyelitis. Bone marrow trephine and MRI confirmed extensive medullary infarction and femoral neck osteonecrosis due to glucocerebroside accumulation. He was started on enzyme replacement therapy to reduce the frequency of further ischaemic events.

osteonecrosis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-transplant osteonecrosis
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive bilateral hip pain post-renal transplant
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male, six months post-renal transplantation, developed severe hip pain while on ciclosporin and prednisolone. MRI showed extensive bilateral femoral head osteonecrosis. Despite the high risk of infection, the patient required bilateral total hip arthroplasty due to rapid articular collapse and loss of mobility.

osteonecrosis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Pregnancy-associated osteonecrosis of the hip
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset hip pain in the third trimester
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old primigravida presented with acute left hip pain and inability to weight-bear. Initially suspected to be transient osteoporosis of pregnancy, postpartum MRI confirmed a focal area of osteonecrosis in the femoral head. She was managed with non-weight bearing for three months, resulting in partial revascularisation and avoidance of surgery.

osteonecrosis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Septic arthritis-induced osteonecrosis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent limp following treated hip infection
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old girl who was treated for Staphylococcus aureus septic arthritis of the hip two years ago presented with a leg length discrepancy. Follow-up X-rays showed complete destruction of the femoral head and neck, representing secondary osteonecrosis due to increased intra-articular pressure and bacterial toxins during the acute infection.

osteonecrosis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: COVID-19 steroid-induced osteonecrosis
  presenting_complaint: New onset hip pain following hospitalisation for pneumonia
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male who received a prolonged course of high-dose dexamethasone for COVID-19 pneumonitis presented four months later with bilateral groin pain. MRI confirmed early-stage bilateral femoral head osteonecrosis. He was managed with alendronic acid and physiotherapy, with close monitoring for progression to collapse.
