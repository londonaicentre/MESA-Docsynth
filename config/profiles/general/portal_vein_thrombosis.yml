  primary_diagnosis: Post-operative portal vein thrombosis
  presenting_complaint: Fever and worsening abdominal distension post-splenectomy
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male underwent elective splenectomy for refractory immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). On post-operative day 5, he developed pyrexia and RUQ pain; a Doppler ultrasound confirmed a thrombus extending from the splenic vein stump into the main portal vein. He was successfully treated with therapeutic anticoagulation and discharged on day 12.

portal_vein_thrombosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Pregnancy-associated portal vein thrombosis
  presenting_complaint: Acute RUQ pain in the second trimester
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old pregnant female (14 weeks gestation) presented with acute RUQ pain and mildly deranged LFTs. MRI confirmed an acute non-occlusive PVT, and subsequent tests identified a Protein S deficiency. She was managed with therapeutic LMWH for the remainder of her pregnancy and the postpartum period without further complications.

portal_vein_thrombosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic chronic portal vein thrombosis
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic splenomegaly
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female was referred from primary care after an incidental finding of an enlarged spleen during an assessment for gallstones. Detailed workup for cirrhosis and prothrombotic states was negative, leading to a diagnosis of idiopathic chronic PVT with cavernoma. She remains under annual review with stable blood counts and no evidence of portal hypertensive complications.

portal_vein_thrombosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Septic pylephlebitis (Septic portal vein thrombosis)
  presenting_complaint: High fever, rigors, and lower abdominal pain
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with acute diverticulitis developed persistent high-grade fevers and RUQ tenderness. CT showed gas bubbles within the portal vein and an occlusive thrombus (pylephlebitis). He required six weeks of intravenous antibiotics and three months of anticoagulation, resulting in resolution of the infection and partial recanalisation of the vein.

portal_vein_thrombosis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent portal vein thrombosis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrence of abdominal pain while on anticoagulation
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male with Essential Thrombocythaemia (ET) and a previous PVT presented with a return of symptoms despite being on apixaban. Repeat imaging showed thrombus extension, suggesting treatment failure on DOAC. He was switched to long-term LMWH and started on hydroxycarbamide to better control his underlying myeloproliferative neoplasm.

portal_vein_thrombosis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Portal vein thrombosis in Polycythaemia Vera
  presenting_complaint: Pruritus, headache, and RUQ fullness
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female with JAK2-positive Polycythaemia Vera presented with symptoms of hyperviscosity and abdominal fullness. Imaging confirmed a moderate-sized PVT and mild splenomegaly. Treatment involved venesection to maintain haematocrit <0.45, aspirin, and therapeutic warfarin, which stabilised the thrombus.

portal_vein_thrombosis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild non-occlusive portal vein thrombosis
  presenting_complaint: Minor dyspepsia
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male underwent an outpatient ultrasound for persistent dyspepsia, which incidentally noted a small, non-occlusive mural thrombus in the right branch of the portal vein. Liver function and fibroscan were normal. Given the lack of risk factors and symptoms, he was managed with short-term anticoagulation and follow-up imaging showed resolution.

portal_vein_thrombosis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute portal vein thrombosis post-liver transplant
  presenting_complaint: Sudden rise in transaminases and graft dysfunction
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female, three days post-orthotopic liver transplant, showed a sudden spike in ALT and AST. Urgent Doppler ultrasound revealed no flow in the portal vein, confirmed as acute thrombosis on CT. She was taken back to theatre for an emergency surgical thrombectomy and revision of the portal anastomosis, successfully salvaging the graft.

portal_vein_thrombosis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic portal vein thrombosis with ascites
  presenting_complaint: Increasing abdominal girth and ankle swelling
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male with cryptogenic cirrhosis presented with new-onset tense ascites. Imaging confirmed chronic, occlusive PVT which had likely precipitated the decompensation of his liver disease. He was managed with high-dose diuretics, salt restriction, and was assessed for a TIPS procedure to manage his refractory ascites.

portal_vein_thrombosis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute portal vein thrombosis in the elderly
  presenting_complaint: Confusion and non-specific abdominal pain
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old female was admitted with delirium and vague abdominal tenderness. While initial suspicion was a UTI, a CT abdomen performed due to persistent pain revealed an acute PVT. Due to her frailty and high falls risk, a multidisciplinary decision was made to use a lower-intensity anticoagulation regimen with close monitoring.

portal_vein_thrombosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic portal vein thrombosis with portal hypertensive gastropathy
  presenting_complaint: Chronic iron-deficiency anaemia
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old girl with a known history of chronic PVT (secondary to neonatal omphalitis) presented with lethargy and pallor. Bloods showed a haemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL with low ferritin. Gastroscopy revealed severe portal hypertensive gastropathy with slow oozing, requiring iron supplementation and an increase in her beta-blocker dose.

portal_vein_thrombosis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Portal vein thrombosis in Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria (PNH)
  presenting_complaint: Dark urine and sharp abdominal pain
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male presented with episodic haemoglobinuria and acute abdominal pain. Flow cytometry confirmed PNH, and MRI showed an acute PVT. He was started on eculizumab to treat the underlying complement-mediated haemolysis and anticoagulated with heparin, leading to a significant improvement in symptoms.

portal_vein_thrombosis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening extensive spleno-portal thrombosis
