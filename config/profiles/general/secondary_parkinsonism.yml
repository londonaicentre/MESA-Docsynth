Slit-lamp examination confirmed Kayser-Fleischer rings, and investigations showed low serum caeruloplasmin (0.08 g/L) and high 24-hour urinary copper. Initiated on penicillamine and a low-copper diet, resulting in gradual stabilization of neurological symptoms over 12 months.

secondary_parkinsonism_006:

  presenting_complaint: Life-threatening "lead-pipe" rigidity, high fever, and altered mental state.
  summary_of_course: 34-year-old male with bipolar disorder recently started on risperidone. Admitted to ICU with hyperpyrexia (40.2°C), tachycardia, and extreme muscle rigidity. Lab results showed a creatine kinase (CK) of 18,000 U/L; managed with aggressive cooling, IV dantrolene, and bromocriptine, leading to full recovery.

  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of weakness and tremor in the left arm and leg.
  summary_of_course: 65-year-old male smoker with sudden left-sided bradykinesia and resting tremor. MRI confirmed a small acute lacunar infarct in the right substantia nigra and midbrain. Symptoms were treated as secondary parkinsonism with levodopa, which provided moderate relief of the motor asymmetry.

  primary_diagnosis: Sodium Valproate-induced parkinsonism
  presenting_complaint: Subacute development of postural tremor and slowed movements.
  summary_of_course: 70-year-old female on high-dose sodium valproate (2500mg/day) for refractory epilepsy. Over six months, she developed a symmetrical parkinsonian syndrome and cognitive slowing.
