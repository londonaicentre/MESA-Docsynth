necrotising_fasciitis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Type II Necrotising Fasciitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe left leg pain, swelling, and high fever.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old previously healthy male presented with excruciating calf pain following a minor abrasion. Despite minimal skin changes initially, he rapidly developed dusky purple bullae and systemic hypotension. Emergency surgical debridement confirmed Type II NF (Group A Streptococcus), requiring multiple trips to theatre and intensive care support for septic shock.

necrotising_fasciitis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Fournier's Gangrene
  presenting_complaint: Perineal pain, swelling, and foul-smelling discharge.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes presented with acute scrotal oedema and crepitus. CT imaging revealed extensive soft tissue gas tracking from the perineum to the anterior abdominal wall. He underwent radical debridement of the scrotum and perineum, followed by vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy and prolonged intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam.

necrotising_fasciitis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Necrotising Fasciitis
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly spreading erythema on the right thigh and lethargy.
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old girl, currently recovering from varicella (chickenpox), presented with a secondary skin infection that progressed to skin necrosis within 6 hours. Clinical diagnosis of NF was made based on "pain out of proportion" and rapid spread across the fascia. Urgent debridement and clindamycin were administered, successfully halting the infection before multi-organ failure occurred.

necrotising_fasciitis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Type I (Polymicrobial) Necrotising Fasciitis
  presenting_complaint: Left forearm swelling and skin blistering at an injection site.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use presented with a suspected abscess that failed to respond to incision and drainage. Over 12 hours, he developed skin anaesthesia and greyish "dishwater" discharge from the wound. Microbiology confirmed a polymicrobial infection including anaerobes and MRSA, necessitating forearm fasciotomy and extensive debridement.

necrotising_fasciitis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Cervical Necrotising Fasciitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe neck pain, dysphagia, and difficulty breathing.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female presented with submandibular swelling following a dental extraction. The infection rapidly descended into the deep neck spaces and mediastinum, identified on CT as gas-forming necrotising fasciitis. She required an emergency tracheostomy, radical neck debridement, and thoracic surgical involvement to manage descending necrotising mediastinitis.

necrotising_fasciitis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute Necrotising Fasciitis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent low-grade fever and non-healing ulcer on the right flank.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with peripheral vascular disease presented with a seemingly superficial flank ulcer that slowly expanded over 5 days. Unlike acute presentations, she remained haemodynamically stable but showed "woody" induration of the skin and elevated CRP (240 mg/L). Surgical exploration revealed extensive fascial necrosis, illustrating a diagnostic challenge where classic rapid progression was absent.

necrotising_fasciitis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Type III (Vibrio) Necrotising Fasciitis
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly evolving haemorrhagic bullae on the right hand.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with chronic liver cirrhosis developed intense hand pain after cleaning seawater fish. Within 8 hours, he developed haemorrhagic bullae and profound septic shock. Blood cultures grew Vibrio vulnificus, and despite aggressive surgical debridement and ceftazidime/doxycycline, the patient succumbed to multi-organ failure.

necrotising_fasciitis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-Surgical Necrotising Fasciitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal wall pain and skin discolouration post-laparotomy.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male, three days post-elective bowel resection, developed sudden-onset tachycardia and "bronzing" of the skin around the surgical incision. Despite appearing as a simple wound infection, the pain was disproportionate to clinical signs, and LRINEC score was 9. Immediate re-laparotomy confirmed extensive necrosis of the rectus sheath, requiring significant abdominal wall resection.

necrotising_fasciitis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic Necrotising Fasciitis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of a chronic diabetic foot ulcer with systemic malaise.
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male with a long-standing neuropathic foot ulcer presented with new-onset confusion and a cold, mottled foot. X-ray showed gas in the soft tissues tracking up to the mid-calf. He was diagnosed with acute necrotising fasciitis complicating a chronic ulcer, necessitating a life-saving below-knee amputation and aggressive fluid resuscitation.

necrotising_fasciitis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Clostridial Myonecrosis (Gas Gangrene)
  presenting_complaint: Intense pain and crepitus in the right thigh following a crush injury.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male involved in a motorcycle accident sustained a contaminated open femur fracture. Within 24 hours, he developed "sweet-smelling" discharge, skin crepitus, and rapid haemolysis. Surgical exploration revealed necrotic muscle and fascia; cultures grew Clostridium perfringens, treated with high-dose penicillin and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

necrotising_fasciitis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Type IV (Fungal) Necrotising Fasciitis
  presenting_complaint: Blackened skin patch on the chest wall in an immunocompromised patient.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female undergoing chemotherapy for AML developed a rapidly expanding necrotic lesion on her chest wall. Initial antibacterial therapy failed, and biopsy revealed invasive Mucormycosis affecting the fascia. Treatment involved radical wide local excision and high-dose liposomal amphotericin B, highlighting an unusual fungal aetiology in a vulnerable host.

necrotising_fasciitis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Obstetric Necrotising Fasciitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe perineal pain and fever 4 days post-partum.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female presented following a second-degree perineal tear during vaginal delivery. She developed rapidly spreading erythema and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Emergency debridement of the episiotomy site revealed NF tracking into the labia and buttocks, requiring multidisciplinary care from obstetrics and plastic surgery.

necrotising_fasciitis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Necrotising Fasciitis mimicking Deep Vein Thrombosis
  presenting_complaint: Unilateral leg swelling and calf tenderness.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male was initially referred to the DVT clinic with a swollen, painful leg. However, the rapid development of skin mottling and a CRP of 350 mg/L prompted a CT scan, which showed fascial thickening and fluid. He was rushed to theatre for debridement of the deep fascia, representing a diagnostic challenge where NF mimicked a common vascular condition.

necrotising_fasciitis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Truncal Necrotising Fasciitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe back pain and spreading redness over the lumbar region.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old obese male (BMI 42) presented with what appeared to be a simple carbuncle on his back. Within 12 hours, the redness spread to his entire posterior trunk with associated skin sloughing. Due to his obesity, the depth of the infection was initially underestimated, leading to delayed debridement and significant tissue loss before the infection was controlled.

necrotising_fasciitis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Necrotising Fasciitis with Toxic Shock Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Faint rash, high fever, and hypotension.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female presented with a small, infected scratch on her arm and rapid-onset multi-organ failure. Despite minimal local necrosis, she had profound hypotension and a diffuse desquamating rash. Group A Strep was isolated from the fascia during exploratory surgery, and she required intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) to manage the associated Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome.

necrotising_fasciitis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-Injection Necrotising Fasciitis
  presenting_complaint: Shoulder pain and swelling following an intramuscular steroid injection.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old bodybuilder presented with acute deltoid pain 48 hours after a self-administered anabolic steroid injection. Ultrasound showed fluid collections along the fascial planes, and surgical exploration confirmed NF. The case was complicated by the patient's reluctance to disclose substance use, which initially masked the likely source of the polymicrobial infection.

necrotising_fasciitis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Necrotising Fasciitis of the Breast
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressing breast redness, pain, and skin necrosis.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female with poorly controlled diabetes presented with what was initially thought to be severe mastitis. The skin quickly became gangrenous with underlying crepitus. She underwent an emergency total mastectomy and debridement of the pectoral fascia, a rare but life-threatening presentation of NF in glandular tissue.

necrotising_fasciitis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Neonatal Necrotising Fasciitis
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal wall erythema and irritability in a 10-day-old infant.
  summary_of_course: A neonate presented with omphalitis (umbilical stump infection) that rapidly spread to the abdominal wall fascia. The infant became septic with metabolic acidosis and thrombocytopenia. Immediate surgical debridement and broad-spectrum antibiotics were curative, though the case highlights the extreme vulnerability and high mortality of NF in the neonatal period.

necrotising_fasciitis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Necrotising Fasciitis with Treatment Failure
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent fever and worsening wound appearance post-debridement.
  summary_of_course: A 56-year-old male underwent initial debridement for thigh NF, but 24 hours later, the infection continued to track proximally despite appropriate antibiotics. Re-exploration showed inadequate initial margins and persistent necrotic tissue. This case required a hip disarticulation as a salvage procedure to stop the relentless cephalad progression of the necrotising process.

necrotising_fasciitis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic Necrotising Fasciitis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of severe groin pain and systemic collapse.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old fit and healthy marathon runner presented with no history of trauma or skin breach. He rapidly developed septic shock and was found to have extensive NF of the pelvic and thigh fascia. No clear portal of entry was ever identified, and the case was managed with emergency surgery and prolonged ICU admission, illustrating that NF can occur even in the absence of risk factors.
