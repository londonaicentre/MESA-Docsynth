  primary_diagnosis: Legionnaires' disease presenting as acute abdomen
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhoea.
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old female was initially referred to the surgical team for suspected cholecystitis. However, she developed a high fever and hypoxia; a CXR revealed dense right-sided consolidation. Legionella urinary antigen was positive, and her gastrointestinal symptoms were determined to be an extrapulmonary manifestation of the infection.

legionnaires_disease_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Legionnaires' disease (non-pneumophila species)
  presenting_complaint: Fever and cough in an immunocompromised host.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male undergoing chemotherapy for lymphoma presented with neutropenic sepsis. Urinary antigen for L. pneumophila was negative, but sputum culture eventually grew Legionella longbeachae.
