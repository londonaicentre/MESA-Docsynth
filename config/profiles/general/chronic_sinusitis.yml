  presenting_complaint: Persistent facial pressure and post-nasal drip
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female reported a 6-month history of dull aching over the maxillary sinuses and frequent throat clearing. Clinical examination showed no polyps but mucopurulent discharge in the middle meatus.

  primary_diagnosis: Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease (Samter's Triad)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent nasal polyps and severe asthma exacerbations
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female with known asthma and aspirin sensitivity presented with her fourth recurrence of nasal polyps despite previous surgeries. She exhibited eosinophilic inflammation on biopsy and high serum IgE levels.

  primary_diagnosis: Maxillary fungal ball (Mycetoma)
  presenting_complaint: Unilateral foul-smelling nasal discharge
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male presented with a persistent malodorous discharge from the right nostril for 9 months. Non-contrast CT showed a hyperdense mass with punctate calcifications in the right maxillary sinus. He underwent a middle meatal antrostomy to remove the fungal debris, which was confirmed as Aspergillus species on histopathology.

  primary_diagnosis: Chronic sinusitis secondary to Cystic Fibrosis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent thick green rhinorrhoea and headache
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old teenager with cystic fibrosis presented with refractory sinus symptoms despite aggressive medical therapy. Microbiology grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa, necessitating targeted nebulised antibiotics and frequent saline washes. He eventually required FESS to improve sinus ventilation and facilitate topical drug delivery.

chronic_sinusitis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Odontogenic chronic sinusitis
  presenting_complaint: Unilateral maxillary pain and salty taste
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female presented with chronic left-sided facial pain following a dental implant procedure. CT imaging revealed a periapical abscess breaching the sinus floor with associated mucosal thickening. Treatment required a combined approach with a dental extraction and endoscopic maxillary antrostomy.

chronic_sinusitis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic sinusitis with Pott's Puffy Tumour
  presenting_complaint: Forehead swelling and severe frontal headache
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with a history of neglected chronic sinusitis presented with a fluctuant mass over the frontal bone. CT showed frontal sinus osteomyelitis and a subgaleal abscess. He was admitted for urgent neurosurgical and ENT intervention, followed by 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics.

chronic_sinusitis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic sinusitis in Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD)
  presenting_complaint: Lifelong nasal congestion and situs inversus
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old girl with Kartagener syndrome presented with chronic mucopurulent rhinosinusitis. Ciliary beat frequency studies confirmed dysmotility. Management focused on aggressive pulmonary hygiene and long-term prophylactic macrolide antibiotics to manage the upper airway reservoir of infection.

chronic_sinusitis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)
  presenting_complaint: Bloody crusting and saddle nose deformity
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male presented with severe nasal crusting, epistaxis, and a recent collapse of the nasal bridge. Blood tests revealed a positive c-ANCA (PR3-specific), and biopsy showed granulomatous inflammation and vasculitis. He was started on immunosuppressive therapy with rituximab and cyclophosphamide.

  primary_diagnosis: Chronic sinusitis with Mucocele
  presenting_complaint: Displacement of the globe and double vision
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female presented with gradual proptosis of the right eye. Imaging identified a large frontal sinus mucocele causing erosion of the orbital roof and mass effect on the superior rectus muscle. She underwent endoscopic marsupialisation of the mucocele, leading to resolution of the diplopia.

  primary_diagnosis: Refractory chronic sinusitis post-radiotherapy
  presenting_complaint: Severe dryness and painful crusting
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male, 3 years post-radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, developed chronic sinusitis due to impaired mucociliary clearance. Examination showed significant mucosal atrophy and staphylococcal biofilms.

  primary_diagnosis: Occupational chronic rhinosinusitis
  presenting_complaint: Congestion and cough worsening during the work week
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old woodworker presented with chronic nasal symptoms that improved during holidays.

  primary_diagnosis: Chronic sinusitis with intracranial abscess
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, fever, and chronic nasal discharge
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with long-standing sinus symptoms presented to A&E with a reduced GCS and seizures.
