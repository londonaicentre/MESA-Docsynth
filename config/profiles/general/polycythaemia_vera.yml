  presenting_complaint: Recurrent epistaxis and bruising despite high blood counts.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with PV and extreme thrombocytosis (1,200 x 10^9/L) presented with paradoxical bleeding. Coagulation studies confirmed acquired von Willebrand syndrome due to high platelet count adsorbing vWF multimers. Hydroxycarbamide was titrated to lower the platelet count, which successfully resolved the bleeding tendency.

  primary_diagnosis: Polycythaemia Vera (Pregnancy Management)
  presenting_complaint: Known PV patient seeking preconception advice.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old woman with PV planned a pregnancy; her hydroxycarbamide was switched to pegylated interferon-alpha. Throughout her pregnancy, she received low-dose aspirin and prophylactic LMWH postpartum. She maintained Hct <0.45 via interferon and occasional venesection, resulting in a healthy live birth at 38 weeks.

  primary_diagnosis: Polycythaemia Vera with Secondary Gout
  presenting_complaint: Acute, exquisitely painful swelling of the first metatarsophalangeal joint.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male presented with a classic gout flare; bloods showed hyperuricaemia and unexpected erythrocytosis (Hb 195g/L). Diagnosis of PV was confirmed via JAK2 mutation and bone marrow trephine. He was treated with colchicine for the flare and commenced on allopurinol alongside PV-specific cytoreduction.

  presenting_complaint: Severe fatigue, fever, and easy bruising.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male with a 12-year history of PV presented with sudden clinical deterioration. Blood film showed 30% circulating blasts and pancytopenia; bone marrow confirmed transformation to AML. Given his age and comorbidities, he was started on palliative low-dose cytarabine and supportive care.

  presenting_complaint: Vague abdominal discomfort and new-onset ascites.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with no liver disease history was found to have portal vein thrombosis on ultrasound.
