tricuspid_stenosis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Rheumatic Tricuspid Stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Progressive exertional dyspnoea and abdominal swelling.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female with a history of rheumatic fever presented with NYHA Class III symptoms. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed thickened tricuspid leaflets with commissural fusion and a mean gradient of 7 mmHg, alongside moderate mitral stenosis. She was commenced on furosemide and referred for double valve replacement.

tricuspid_stenosis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Carcinoid Heart Disease
  presenting_complaint: Profuse watery diarrhoea, cutaneous flushing, and peripheral oedema.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with a known midgut neuroendocrine tumour presented with worsening right-sided heart failure. Echo demonstrated classic "frozen" tricuspid leaflets in a semi-open position, causing severe stenosis and regurgitation. Urinary 5-HIAA levels were significantly elevated, and he was stabilised with octreotide before considering valve surgery.

tricuspid_stenosis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Large Right Atrial Myxoma
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent syncope and positional breathlessness.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female presented to A&E after a collapse. Auscultation revealed a "tumour plop" and a diastolic murmur that changed with position. Emergency echo identified a 5cm pedunculated mass prolapsing through the tricuspid valve, causing functional severe tricuspid stenosis; she underwent urgent surgical excision with resolution of symptoms.

tricuspid_stenosis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Infective Endocarditis with Obstructive Vegetation
  presenting_complaint: Fever, rigors, and new-onset right-sided heart failure.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male intravenous drug user presented with Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) showed a massive 2.5cm vegetation on the tricuspid valve almost completely occluding the orifice during diastole. Despite intensive IV antibiotics, he developed refractory hepatic congestion and required emergency vegetectomy and valve repair.

tricuspid_stenosis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Congenital Tricuspid Stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Cyanosis and poor feeding in an infant.
  summary_of_course: A 4-month-old infant was referred to paediatric cardiology for failure to thrive. Echo confirmed isolated congenital tricuspid stenosis with a hypoplastic annulus and a mean gradient of 9 mmHg. The patient underwent successful surgical valvotomy to improve right ventricular filling and systemic oxygenation.

tricuspid_stenosis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Pacemaker Lead-Induced Tricuspid Stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Increasing abdominal girth and bilateral leg oedema.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male with a permanent pacemaker implanted 15 years ago presented with chronic right heart failure. Investigations revealed significant fibrosis and adhesions around the ventricular lead, tethering the tricuspid leaflets and causing severe mechanical stenosis. The lead was extracted via laser-assisted sheath, and the valve was replaced with a bioprosthesis.

tricuspid_stenosis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Bioprosthetic Tricuspid Valve Stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue and exertional presyncope.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female who had a biological tricuspid valve replacement 12 years prior for Ebstein's anomaly presented with signs of valve failure. Echo showed heavy calcification of the prosthetic leaflets with a mean diastolic gradient of 12 mmHg. She was successfully treated with a valve-in-valve transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement (TTVR).

tricuspid_stenosis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Libman-Sacks Endocarditis
  presenting_complaint: Pleuritic chest pain and malar rash.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) presented with an acute flare. Echo incidentally noted verrucous vegetations on the atrial surface of the tricuspid valve causing moderate functional stenosis. Symptoms improved following intensified immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil and high-dose corticosteroids.

tricuspid_stenosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Mediastinal Radiation-Induced Valvular Disease
  presenting_complaint: Dyspnoea on climbing stairs.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male, treated 20 years ago with high-dose mediastinal radiation for Hodgkin lymphoma, presented with multi-valvular disease. Imaging confirmed restrictive calcification of the tricuspid and aortic valves, with the tricuspid valve showing moderate stenosis (mean gradient 5 mmHg). He is currently managed medically with salt restriction and diuretics.

tricuspid_stenosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic Tricuspid Stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Severe jaundice, ascites, and breathlessness.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old patient with known mild rheumatic TS presented with acute decompensation following an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The loss of atrial kick led to a precipitous drop in cardiac output and worsening of the trans-valvular gradient. Rate control and cardioversion restored haemodynamic stability and returned the gradient to baseline.

tricuspid_stenosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma with Atrial Extension
  presenting_complaint: Haematuria and right-sided heart failure symptoms.
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male was found to have a large renal mass with a tumour thrombus extending up the inferior vena cava into the right atrium. The thrombus partially obstructed the tricuspid valve, mimicking severe stenosis. He underwent a complex radical nephrectomy and atriotomy for tumour thrombectomy.

tricuspid_stenosis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Asymptomatic Tricuspid Stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Routine follow-up for hypertension.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female was found to have a mid-diastolic murmur during a routine GP check-up. TTE showed mild thickening of the tricuspid leaflets with a mean gradient of 2 mmHg and no right atrial enlargement. No intervention was required, and she was scheduled for biennial echocardiographic surveillance.

tricuspid_stenosis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe TS with Cardiac Cirrhosis
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice and tender hepatomegaly.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with long-standing, untreated tricuspid stenosis presented with liver failure. Liver biopsy and fibroscan confirmed cardiac cirrhosis due to chronic venous congestion. Given his frailty and multiple comorbidities, he was deemed high-risk for surgery and is managed with palliative diuretics.

tricuspid_stenosis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic TS post-Annuloplasty
  presenting_complaint: Early post-operative low cardiac output syndrome.
  summary_of_course: A 49-year-old patient underwent tricuspid valve repair with a rigid annuloplasty ring for severe regurgitation. Post-bypass TOE revealed an unexpectedly high mean gradient of 10 mmHg due to over-reduction of the annulus. The ring was replaced with a larger size during the same session, resolving the iatrogenic stenosis.

tricuspid_stenosis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Low-Flow, Low-Gradient Tricuspid Stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic fatigue and cold extremities.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male with severe LV dysfunction and low stroke volume index showed only a 3 mmHg gradient across the tricuspid valve. Clinical suspicion remained high due to a prominent 'a' wave in the JVP. Dobutamine stress echocardiography increased the cardiac output, revealing a true mean gradient of 8 mmHg, confirming severe underlying stenosis.

tricuspid_stenosis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Tricuspid Stenosis with Paradoxical Embolism
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset left-sided weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old female with moderate TS presented with an ischaemic stroke. Investigations revealed a Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) with a right-to-left shunt, exacerbated by high right atrial pressures from the tricuspid stenosis. She underwent PFO closure and subsequent tricuspid valve balloon valvuloplasty.

tricuspid_stenosis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe TS in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Orthopnoea in the second trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old pregnant female with previously undiagnosed rheumatic TS presented at 24 weeks gestation with pulmonary congestion. While TS usually protects the lungs, her concomitant mitral stenosis caused the primary issue, but the TS limited the efficacy of diuretic therapy. She was managed with bed rest and beta-blockers, successfully delivering via elective C-section at 34 weeks.

tricuspid_stenosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Degenerative Calcific Tricuspid Stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Slow decline in exercise tolerance.
  summary_of_course: An 89-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis was found to have co-existing calcific tricuspid stenosis. Given her age and the complexity of multi-valve surgery, she underwent a TAVI for the aortic valve. The tricuspid stenosis was managed conservatively as it was deemed moderate and less symptomatic than the aortic disease.

tricuspid_stenosis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: TS secondary to Loeffler Endocarditis
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss, eosinophilia, and heart failure.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male with hypereosinophilic syndrome presented with restrictive cardiomyopathy. Echo showed endomyocardial fibrosis involving the right ventricular apex and the tricuspid valve apparatus, leading to severe inflow obstruction. Treatment involved steroids and hydroxycarbamide to manage the underlying eosinophilia, alongside heart failure therapy.

tricuspid_stenosis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Massive RA Thrombus masquerading as TS
  presenting_complaint: Acute shortness of breath and hypotension.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with a history of AF and sub-therapeutic anticoagulation presented in obstructive shock. Emergency CT pulmonary angiogram and echo showed a large "ball-valve" thrombus in the right atrium intermittently occluding the tricuspid orifice. He was treated with emergency systemic thrombolysis with successful dissolution of the clot and restoration of flow.
