  primary_diagnosis: Severe status asthmaticus in an obese patient
  presenting_complaint: Orthopnoea and severe work of breathing.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female with a BMI of 44 and difficult-to-treat asthma presented in status asthmaticus. Management was complicated by her size, making ventilation difficult and increasing the risk of atelectasis. She was managed with early aggressive nebulisation and IV magnesium, requiring a longer stay on the respiratory high-care unit for weaning.

status_asthmaticus_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Aspirin-exacerbated status asthmaticus
  presenting_complaint: Rapid onset of severe wheeze and facial flushing after taking ibuprofen.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male with Samter’s Triad (asthma, nasal polyps, and aspirin sensitivity) developed life-threatening bronchospasm shortly after taking an NSAID for a headache. He required emergency stabilisation with IM adrenaline and IV hydrocortisone. He was counselled extensively on the avoidance of all COX-1 inhibitors.

status_asthmaticus_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute status asthmaticus with steroid resistance
  presenting_complaint: Persistent wheeze despite five days of oral prednisolone.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old female smoker presented with ongoing symptoms despite primary care intervention. Investigations showed persistent eosinophilia and low PEFR. She was admitted for IV methylprednisolone and a trial of aminophylline, eventually responding after 72 hours of intensive inpatient therapy.

  primary_diagnosis: Status asthmaticus complicated by surgical emphysema
  presenting_complaint: Swelling of the neck and a "crackling" sensation under the skin during an asthma attack.
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old male presented with severe bronchospasm and palpable crepitus over his neck and upper chest. A CT thorax confirmed pneumomediastinum and surgical emphysema caused by high intra-alveolar pressure during coughing. He was managed conservatively for the air leak while receiving intensive treatment for his status asthmaticus.

status_asthmaticus_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Late-onset status asthmaticus
  presenting_complaint: First-ever episode of severe wheeze and breathlessness.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with no prior respiratory history presented with acute respiratory distress. Initially suspected to be acute pulmonary oedema (cardiac asthma), an urgent echocardiogram was normal, and high-dose bronchodilators led to rapid improvement. He was diagnosed with late-onset asthma and stabilised with a MART (Maintenance and Reliever Therapy) regimen.

status_asthmaticus_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Status asthmaticus with secondary bacterial pneumonia
  presenting_complaint: Fever, purulent sputum, and severe wheeze.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female presented with status asthmaticus likely triggered by a lower respiratory tract infection. Chest X-ray confirmed right middle lobe consolidation.

status_asthmaticus_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Exercise-induced status asthmaticus
  presenting_complaint: Severe respiratory distress immediately following a competitive football match.
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old male with mild intermittent asthma presented to A&E via ambulance after collapsing on the pitch. He was refractory to his blue inhaler and required IV magnesium and a salbutamol infusion. Following recovery, his maintenance therapy was stepped up to include a Long-Acting Beta-Agonist (LABA).

status_asthmaticus_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Status asthmaticus in a patient with vocal cord dysfunction (VCD)
  presenting_complaint: Stridor-like wheeze and refractory breathlessness.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female presented with what appeared to be severe asthma, but symptoms were unusually resistant to nebulisers. Bedside nasendoscopy during the acute phase suggested paradoxical vocal fold movement co-existing with true bronchospasm. She was treated for status asthmaticus but also referred for specialised speech and language therapy to manage the VCD component.
