  primary_diagnosis: Diffuse Brain Injury secondary to Blast Overpressure
  presenting_complaint: Tinnitus, confusion, and memory gaps after an explosion
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old military veteran presented with chronic cognitive deficits following exposure to an IED blast. While acute CT was normal, DTI-MRI later showed reduced fractional anisotropy in the frontal lobes. He suffers from significant PTSD comorbidity, complicating the management of his diffuse neuroaxonal damage.

diffuse_brain_injury_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic Diffuse Brain Injury
  presenting_complaint: Prolonged disorientation following a minor trip and fall
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with pre-existing vascular dementia fell at home. Although the trauma was low-energy, he experienced a disproportionate decline in GCS and new-onset dysphagia. Imaging showed new diffuse punctate haemorrhages superimposed on chronic small vessel disease, leading to a transition to palliative care.

diffuse_brain_injury_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate DAI with Post-Traumatic Epilepsy
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent tonic-clonic seizures following a cycling accident
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female sustained a moderate diffuse injury (GCS 11) after falling without a helmet. Six months post-injury, she developed focal seizures with secondary generalisation. EEG showed diffuse slowing with epileptiform discharges, and she was commenced on levetiracetam with good seizure control but persistent cognitive slowing.

  primary_diagnosis: Second Impact Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Sudden collapse during a football match
  summary_of_course: A 17-year-old male, who had sustained a minor concussion four days prior, received a second minor blow to the head. He collapsed immediately due to loss of cerebrovascular autoregulation and massive diffuse cerebral oedema. Despite emergency neurosurgery, the outcome was fatal due to refractory intracranial hypertension.

diffuse_brain_injury_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Diffuse Brain Injury with Syndrome of the Trephined
  presenting_complaint: Sinking skin flap and neurological decline post-craniectomy
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old male who underwent a craniectomy for severe diffuse swelling six months ago presented with new-onset hemiparesis and headaches. The "sinking" of the scalp flap was causing atmospheric pressure-related cortical dysfunction. Symptoms resolved completely following an elective titanium cranioplasty.

diffuse_brain_injury_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Diffuse Injury in a patient with Haemophilia A
  presenting_complaint: Worsening headache 12 hours after a minor bump to the head
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male with known Haemophilia A presented to A&E after a low-impact injury. Initial GCS was 15, but he was admitted for Factor VIII replacement and serial imaging due to high risk. Repeat CT showed evolution of diffuse petechial haemorrhages, which were managed non-operatively with factor optimisation.
