  presenting_complaint: Extreme fatigue, abdominal swelling, and yellowing of the eyes.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female presented with an eight-week history of worsening lethargy and new-onset ascites. Serology showed ANA 1:1280 and IgG 32 g/L, while liver biopsy confirmed interface hepatitis and plasma cell infiltration. She was started on high-dose prednisolone but failed to show biochemical improvement by day 14, necessitating escalation to a specialist hepatology unit.

  primary_diagnosis: Wilson disease (subacute presentation)
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice and new-onset hand tremors.
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old male presented with a four-month history of declining school performance followed by two months of progressive jaundice. Examination revealed Kayser-Fleischer rings and a low serum caeruloplasmin of 0.08 g/L. He was diagnosed with Wilson disease and started on chelation therapy, but rapidly rising INR and bilirubin levels indicated subacute failure, leading to a successful deceased donor liver transplant.

  presenting_complaint: Nausea, vomiting, and jaundice following chemotherapy.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male undergoing Rituximab-based chemotherapy for B-cell lymphoma developed jaundice 10 weeks into treatment.

  presenting_complaint: Painful hepatomegaly and rapidly increasing abdominal girth.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female with previously undiagnosed Factor V Leiden mutation presented with a seven-week history of upper abdominal pain and ascites. Doppler ultrasound and CT venogram confirmed hepatic vein thrombosis with a congested liver.

  primary_diagnosis: Isoniazid-induced subacute liver failure
  presenting_complaint: Loss of appetite and jaundice.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male on quadruple therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis presented with jaundice in the third month of treatment. Investigations revealed Isoniazid-induced hepatotoxicity with a bilirubin of 290 µmol/L and INR 1.8. Anti-tuberculous medication was suspended, but the patient developed progressive liver failure and secondary fungal sepsis, resulting in a prolonged ICU admission.

subacute_liver_failure_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute liver failure due to Hepatitis E
  presenting_complaint: Severe lethargy and jaundice.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male presented with a six-week history of worsening jaundice following a trip to rural Europe where he consumed undercooked pork. HEV IgM and PCR were positive, and his clinical course was complicated by an INR of 2.5 and Grade I encephalopathy. He was managed supportively in a regional liver centre and eventually cleared the virus with Ribavirin therapy.

subacute_liver_failure_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric autoimmune subacute liver failure
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal pain and yellowing of the eyes.
  summary_of_course: A 9-year-old girl presented with an eight-week history of vague abdominal symptoms and progressive icterus. Laboratory results showed ALT 900 U/L, IgG 40 g/L, and positive anti-LKM1 antibodies. Despite aggressive immunosuppression with steroids and azathioprine, her synthetic function declined (INR 3.1), and she underwent a successful split-liver transplant.

subacute_liver_failure_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Amiodarone-induced subacute liver toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss, jaundice, and breathlessness.
  summary_of_course: An 81-year-old male on long-term amiodarone for atrial fibrillation presented with a three-month history of declining liver function. Imaging showed a hyperdense liver on CT, and biopsy revealed phospholipidosis and Mallory-Denk bodies. The drug was discontinued, but his subacute liver failure was exacerbated by underlying heart failure, leading to palliative management.

subacute_liver_failure_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Malignant infiltration mimicking subacute liver failure
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive jaundice and massive hepatomegaly.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female presented with a ten-week history of weight loss and jaundice. Initial labs showed a bilirubin of 340 µmol/L and LDH of 2500 U/L. A liver biopsy unexpectedly revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma infiltrating the hepatic sinusoids, rather than primary liver disease, and she was started on urgent chemotherapy.

subacute_liver_failure_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute liver failure secondary to Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice and lower limb oedema.
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old male with the PiZZ phenotype presented with a 14-week history of progressive jaundice following a mild viral illness. He had no prior history of liver disease but developed subacute synthetic failure with an INR of 2.3 and albumin of 22 g/L. He was listed for liver transplantation as his condition failed to stabilise with supportive medical management.

  presenting_complaint: Jaundice and bruising.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old female with rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate (20mg weekly) for five years presented with a two-month history of progressive jaundice. Investigation revealed significant hepatic fibrosis and superimposed subacute inflammation, likely exacerbated by recent increased alcohol intake. Despite stopping methotrexate, she developed refractory ascites and was referred for transplant evaluation.

subacute_liver_failure_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Sodium Valproate-induced subacute liver failure
  presenting_complaint: Vomiting, lethargy, and jaundice.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with refractory epilepsy started on sodium valproate four months prior presented with a six-week history of declining liver function. Laboratory tests showed hyperammonaemia and a coagulopathy unresponsive to Vitamin K. He was diagnosed with valproate-induced mitochondrial hepatotoxicity and treated with L-carnitine, but his condition progressed to life-threatening failure.

subacute_liver_failure_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Pregnancy-related subacute liver failure (AFLP)
  presenting_complaint: Post-partum jaundice and confusion.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old female presented four weeks post-emergency C-section with persistent jaundice and new-onset encephalopathy. Initially thought to be pre-eclampsia related, her prolonged course and biopsy findings were consistent with a subacute presentation of Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy (AFLP). She required plasma exchange and intensive support before showing signs of hepatic regeneration.

  primary_diagnosis: Primary Biliary Cholangitis/Autoimmune Hepatitis overlap syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Intense pruritus and jaundice over three months.
  summary_of_course: A 56-year-old female presented with a subacute decline in liver function characterised by a bilirubin of 450 µmol/L and positive AMA and SMA serology. Biopsy confirmed an AIH/PBC overlap syndrome with severe ductopenia and interface hepatitis.

  primary_diagnosis: Subacute liver failure due to secondary sclerosing cholangitis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent fevers and progressive jaundice.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male who had a prolonged ICU stay for polytrauma developed progressive cholestatic liver failure over 16 weeks. ERCP showed diffuse biliary strictures consistent with secondary sclerosing cholangitis of the critically ill. His liver function continued to deteriorate with rising bilirubin and falling albumin, eventually requiring a liver transplant.
