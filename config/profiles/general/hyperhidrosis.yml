hyperhidrosis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary focal palmar hyperhidrosis
  presenting_complaint: Excessive sweating of the hands and difficulty holding pens.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old male presents with a lifelong history of bilateral, symmetrical hand sweating that worsens during school exams. Physical examination reveals visible beads of sweat on the palms and maceration of the skin. He was prescribed 20% aluminium chloride hexahydrate solution for nocturnal application, resulting in significant improvement in his ability to perform schoolwork.

hyperhidrosis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary generalised hyperhidrosis due to hyperthyroidism
  presenting_complaint: Profuse sweating, weight loss, and palpitations.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female presents with subacute onset of generalised sweating and heat intolerance over three months. Blood tests reveal a suppressed TSH (<0.01 mU/L) and elevated Free T4, confirming Grave's disease. Treatment with carbimazole and propranolol led to the resolution of hyperhidrosis as thyroid function normalised.

hyperhidrosis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe axillary hyperhidrosis
  presenting_complaint: Constant underarm sweating requiring multiple changes of clothes daily.
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old woman reports severe axillary sweating since puberty that has failed to respond to high-strength topical antiperspirants. She scores 4 on the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS), indicating her sweating is intolerable and always interferes with daily activities. She was referred for Botulinum toxin A injections, which provided relief for six months.

hyperhidrosis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Compensatory hyperhidrosis post-ETS
  presenting_complaint: Drenching sweat on the trunk and thighs following surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male underwent endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS) for palmar hyperhidrosis two years ago. While his hands remain dry, he now suffers from severe compensatory sweating on his chest, back, and legs. He is currently being managed with oral oxybutynin 5mg twice daily, which has moderately reduced the volume of sweat.

hyperhidrosis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Gustatory hyperhidrosis (Frey's syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Sweating and flushing on the cheek while eating.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male presents with localised sweating on the right parotid region triggered by mastication, specifically with acidic foods. This follows a parotidectomy performed eighteen months prior for a pleomorphic adenoma. Diagnosis was confirmed with a Minor's starch-iodine test, and he is managed with topical glycopyrrolate cream.

hyperhidrosis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Nocturnal hyperhidrosis secondary to Hodgkin lymphoma
  presenting_complaint: Drenching night sweats and unexplained weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male reports a four-week history of severe night sweats requiring him to change his bedsheets. Clinical examination reveals painless cervical lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. A lymph node biopsy confirmed Hodgkin lymphoma, and the hyperhidrosis resolved following the initiation of ABVD chemotherapy.

hyperhidrosis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Medication-induced generalised hyperhidrosis
  presenting_complaint: Increased sweating since starting new antidepressant.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female with major depressive disorder reports generalised diaphoresis shortly after increasing her dose of Sertraline to 100mg. The sweating is most prominent on the forehead and neck and occurs regardless of activity level. Switching the medication to Mirtazapine resulted in a cessation of the excessive sweating.

hyperhidrosis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary plantar hyperhidrosis with secondary tinea pedis
  presenting_complaint: Extremely sweaty feet and itchy, peeling skin between toes.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male athlete presents with chronic plantar hyperhidrosis and a secondary fungal infection (tinea pedis) due to the moist environment. He was treated with topical terbinafine for the infection and advised on moisture-wicking socks and aluminium chloride for the hyperhidrosis. Iontophoresis was later introduced for long-term maintenance.

hyperhidrosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Craniofacial hyperhidrosis
  presenting_complaint: Embarrassing facial sweating during social interactions.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old businessman presents with severe sweating of the forehead and scalp during meetings, causing significant social anxiety. Medical history is unremarkable, and secondary causes were ruled out via blood panels. He was started on oral glycopyrrolate 1mg daily, which successfully controlled the symptoms with minimal side effects of dry mouth.

hyperhidrosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary hyperhidrosis due to pheochromocytoma
  presenting_complaint: Episodic sweating, headaches, and racing heart.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presents with paroxysmal episodes of profuse sweating and hypertension. 24-hour urinary metanephrines were significantly elevated, and a CT scan identified a 4cm adrenal mass. Following alpha and beta-blockade, the patient underwent a successful adrenalectomy, which cured the hyperhidrosis.

hyperhidrosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Menopausal vasomotor symptoms (Hyperhidrosis)
  presenting_complaint: Frequent hot flushes and night sweats.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female presents with subacute onset of "hot flushes" and associated drenching sweats that disrupt her sleep. She has no other systemic symptoms, and her FSH levels are elevated, consistent with menopause. She was started on Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT), which led to a dramatic reduction in the frequency and severity of the sweating episodes.

hyperhidrosis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary focal axillary hyperhidrosis with bromhidrosis
  presenting_complaint: Excessive sweating and offensive body odour.
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old male presents with axillary hyperhidrosis complicated by bromhidrosis (foul-smelling sweat). Despite good hygiene, the odour persists, leading to social isolation. Management included topical erythromycin for bacterial overgrowth and MiraDry (microwave thermolysis) to permanently reduce the number of sweat glands.

hyperhidrosis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Harlequin syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Unilateral facial sweating and flushing during exercise.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female noticed that during gym sessions, only the left side of her face flushes and sweats, while the right side remains pale and dry. Neurological examination and MRI of the neck and thorax were performed to rule out Horner's syndrome or structural lesions. The diagnosis of Harlequin syndrome was made, and as the symptoms were benign, she chose conservative management.

hyperhidrosis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary hyperhidrosis due to nocturnal hypoglycaemia
  presenting_complaint: Waking up in the middle of the night feeling sweaty and shaky.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with Type 2 Diabetes on insulin reports recurrent episodes of drenching night sweats. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) revealed significant nocturnal hypoglycaemic events. Adjusting his basal insulin dose and timing of his evening meal resolved the nocturnal hyperhidrosis.

hyperhidrosis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute hyperhidrosis due to alcohol withdrawal
  presenting_complaint: Severe sweating, tremors, and agitation.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male was admitted to the hospital for an unrelated fracture but developed profuse sweating and tachycardia 24 hours after admission. He confessed to heavy daily alcohol use. He was started on a Chlordiazepoxide weaning protocol for alcohol withdrawal, and his diaphoresis subsided over five days.

hyperhidrosis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary palmar hyperhidrosis (Treatment failure)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent hand sweating despite multiple treatments.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female has tried topical aluminium chloride, oral anticholinergics, and home iontophoresis for her palmar hyperhidrosis without success. She reports significant psychological distress and career limitations. She is currently being assessed for Botulinum toxin injections under the NHS, as she meets the criteria for severe, refractory focal hyperhidrosis.

hyperhidrosis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Generalised hyperhidrosis secondary to obesity
  presenting_complaint: Constant sweating with minimal exertion.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male with a BMI of 42 kg/m² reports generalised hyperhidrosis that is worse in skin folds, leading to recurrent intertrigo. Investigations for endocrine causes were negative. Management focused on weight loss through a structured diet and exercise programme, alongside topical antifungals for the skin fold complications.

hyperhidrosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Childhood-onset primary focal hyperhidrosis
  presenting_complaint: Wetting paper while drawing and damp socks.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old girl presents with bilateral palmar and plantar sweating since the age of five. Her parents are concerned about her social development as she avoids holding hands. Conservative management with mild antiperspirants and psychological support was initiated, with a plan to consider iontophoresis when she is older.

hyperhidrosis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary hyperhidrosis due to Parkinson's disease
  presenting_complaint: Episodic drenching sweats and "off" periods.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with established Parkinson's disease experiences bouts of profuse sweating, often coinciding with the wearing-off of his levodopa doses. This autonomic dysfunction is a known non-motor symptom of his condition. Optimising his dopaminergic therapy and adding low-dose propantheline bromide helped stabilise his thermoregulation.

hyperhidrosis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic hyperhidrosis (Sepsis)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of sweating, fever, and confusion.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old resident of a care home with chronic mild hyperhidrosis presents with acute, drenching diaphoresis, rigors, and hypotension. Blood cultures grew E. coli, confirming urosepsis. The acute hyperhidrosis was a physiological response to systemic infection and resolved following intravenous antibiotic therapy and fluid resuscitation.
