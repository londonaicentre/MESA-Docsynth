  presenting_complaint: Morning limb jerks and "drops"
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old male complained of "electric shock" sensations in his arms shortly after waking, occasionally causing him to drop his toothbrush. After a night of sleep deprivation, he suffered a full GTCS. EEG showed polyspike-wave complexes, and he was started on Sodium Valproate following extensive counselling regarding lifestyle and medication.

seizure_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-traumatic epilepsy
  presenting_complaint: Focal twitching of the left hand
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male who sustained a severe traumatic brain injury in a road traffic accident two years ago presented with focal motor seizures. The seizures involved rhythmic jerking of the left hand without loss of awareness. MRI showed an area of encephalomalacia in the right frontal cortex, and he was managed with Lacosamide.

seizure_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Metabolic seizure secondary to hypoglycaemia
  presenting_complaint: Confusion and shaking in a known diabetic
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with Type 1 Diabetes was found by his partner in a confused state followed by a brief generalised seizure. Paramedics recorded a capillary blood glucose of 1.6 mmol/L. The seizure resolved immediately following administration of IV 10% Dextrose, and no long-term anticonvulsants were required.

seizure_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Frontal lobe epilepsy
  presenting_complaint: Nocturnal episodes of bipedal cycling and shouting
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female's partner reported frequent, brief, and violent nocturnal movements where she would kick her legs and scream. Initially misdiagnosed as night terrors, sleep-deprived EEG and home video monitoring suggested frontal lobe origin. She showed a significant reduction in event frequency after starting Topiramate.

seizure_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Seizure secondary to intracranial malignancy
  presenting_complaint: First-ever seizure in an elderly patient
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male presented with a new-onset GTCS and a three-week history of progressive left-sided weakness. Contrast-enhanced MRI revealed a large, ring-enhancing lesion in the right parietal lobe suspicious for glioblastoma multiforme. He was started on Dexamethasone to reduce peritumoural oedema and Levetiracetam for seizure prophylaxis.

seizure_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory status epilepticus
  presenting_complaint: Non-convulsive status in the ICU
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female remained comatose following a cardiac arrest. Continuous EEG monitoring revealed ongoing subclinical electrographic seizures despite Midazolam and Levetiracetam. The condition was managed as refractory status epilepticus with a Propofol infusion titrated to burst-suppression on EEG, though the ultimate prognosis remained poor.

seizure_016:

  primary_diagnosis: Hyponatraemic seizure
  presenting_complaint: Seizure in the context of profound electrolyte imbalance
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female on Indapamide for hypertension was admitted with confusion and a GTCS. Blood tests revealed a serum sodium of 110 mmol/L. She was treated with a cautious bolus of 3% hypertonic saline to stop the seizure activity, followed by slow correction of the hyponatraemia to avoid osmotic demyelination syndrome.

seizure_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Neonatal seizures
  presenting_complaint: Subtle "cycling" movements in a newborn
  summary_of_course: A 2-day-old neonate born via emergency ventouse for fetal distress began exhibiting repetitive "bicycling" leg movements and apnoea.
