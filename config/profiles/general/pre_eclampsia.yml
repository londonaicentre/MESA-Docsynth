pre_eclampsia_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild pre-eclampsia
  presenting_complaint: Routine antenatal check with elevated blood pressure and trace proteinuria.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old primigravida at 34 weeks gestation presented to her community midwife with a blood pressure of 145/95 mmHg. Urinalysis showed 1+ proteinuria and a subsequent protein-creatinine ratio (PCR) was 35 mg/mmol. She remains asymptomatic and is being managed in the outpatient maternity assessment unit with twice-weekly monitoring and oral labetalol 100mg BD.

pre_eclampsia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe pre-eclampsia
  presenting_complaint: Frontal headache and blurred vision at 31 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old woman presented acutely to the delivery suite with a blood pressure of 175/115 mmHg and 3+ proteinuria. She reported persistent scotomata and a severe headache unresponsive to paracetamol. She was commenced on IV magnesium sulphate for seizure prophylaxis and IV hydralazine for blood pressure control, with plans for urgent caesarean section due to maternal clinical deterioration.

pre_eclampsia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: HELLP syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Severe epigastric pain and nausea in the third trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old G2P1 at 33 weeks gestation presented with acute right upper quadrant pain and vomiting. Blood results revealed a platelet count of 65 x 10^9/L, elevated AST of 250 U/L, and evidence of haemolysis on blood film. She was diagnosed with HELLP syndrome, a life-threatening variant of pre-eclampsia, and underwent emergency delivery following stabilising doses of corticosteroids and magnesium sulphate.

pre_eclampsia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Postpartum pre-eclampsia
  presenting_complaint: New onset headache and peripheral oedema five days after delivery.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old woman, whose pregnancy was uncomplicated, presented to the emergency department five days postpartum with a severe throbbing headache. Her blood pressure was 168/104 mmHg with 2+ proteinuria on dipstick. She was readmitted for blood pressure management with nifedipine and monitoring for late-onset pre-eclampsia, eventually stabilising after 48 hours.

pre_eclampsia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Superimposed pre-eclampsia on chronic hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Sudden increase in blood pressure and new-onset proteinuria at 30 weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old woman with pre-existing essential hypertension managed on methyldopa presented with a sudden rise in BP to 165/110 mmHg. Investigations confirmed a new urine PCR of 120 mg/mmol and rising serum uric acid levels. This acute-on-chronic presentation required an increase in antihypertensive therapy and close inpatient surveillance for fetal growth restriction.

pre_eclampsia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Eclampsia
  presenting_complaint: Tonic-clonic seizure at 37 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old primigravida was brought to the hospital via ambulance following a witnessed tonic-clonic seizure at home. On arrival, she was post-ictal with a BP of 180/120 mmHg and significant facial oedema. She was immediately treated with a loading dose of magnesium sulphate and underwent an emergency category 1 caesarean section; she remained in the ICU for 24 hours post-delivery.

pre_eclampsia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Early-onset severe pre-eclampsia
  presenting_complaint: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and elevated Doppler resistance at 26 weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old woman (IVF pregnancy) was found to have a small-for-gestational-age fetus on a growth scan. Subsequent maternal assessment revealed a BP of 160/105 mmHg and a urine PCR of 250 mg/mmol. Due to the high risk of fetal distress and maternal complications at this early gestation, she was admitted for intensive monitoring and betamethasone for fetal lung maturity.

pre_eclampsia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Pre-eclampsia with pulmonary oedema
  presenting_complaint: Acute shortness of breath and orthopnoea at 34 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old woman with known moderate pre-eclampsia developed sudden respiratory distress while on the ward. Oxygen saturations dropped to 89% on room air, and chest auscultation revealed bilateral basal crackles. An urgent echocardiogram and chest X-ray confirmed pulmonary oedema secondary to severe pre-eclampsia, necessitating IV furosemide and immediate delivery.

pre_eclampsia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Pre-eclampsia with acute kidney injury (AKI)
  presenting_complaint: Reduced urine output and generalized swelling.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old at 31 weeks gestation presented with significant pretibial and hand oedema. Labs showed a serum creatinine of 155 umol/L (up from a baseline of 60) and oliguria of <20ml/hr. Diagnosed with severe pre-eclampsia complicated by AKI stage 2, she required careful fluid balance management and urgent obstetric intervention to prevent permanent renal damage.

pre_eclampsia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Non-proteinuric pre-eclampsia
  presenting_complaint: Persistent scotoma and BP of 162/112 mmHg.
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old at 35 weeks gestation presented with visual disturbances but repeatedly had negative urine dipsticks for protein. However, her blood pressure remained severely elevated and she developed new-onset thrombocytopenia (90 x 10^9/L). This atypical presentation was managed as severe pre-eclampsia despite the absence of proteinuria, leading to induction of labour.

pre_eclampsia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Pre-eclampsia with placental abruption
  presenting_complaint: Sharp abdominal pain and dark vaginal bleeding at 35 weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old woman with poorly controlled gestational hypertension presented with a woody, tender uterus and moderate vaginal bleeding. Her BP was 170/110 mmHg and fetal heart rate monitoring showed late decelerations. The clinical picture of placental abruption secondary to acute pre-eclampsia necessitated an emergency caesarean section and blood transfusion for maternal haemorrhage.

pre_eclampsia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate pre-eclampsia in twin pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Rapid weight gain and excessive leg swelling at 32 weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old with a DCDA twin pregnancy presented with a 4kg weight gain in one week and significant pitting oedema. BP was 155/100 mmHg and urine PCR was 60 mg/mmol. Given the increased metabolic demand of twins, she was admitted for bed rest and blood pressure titration, with a planned delivery at 34 weeks.

pre_eclampsia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Pre-eclampsia with hepatic subcapsular haematoma
  presenting_complaint: Sudden collapse and severe right-sided pleuritic chest pain.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old at 29 weeks gestation with known severe pre-eclampsia suffered a sudden haemodynamic collapse. Urgent CT imaging revealed a ruptured hepatic subcapsular haematoma. This rare and life-threatening complication required massive transfusion protocol activation and multidisciplinary surgical intervention alongside emergency delivery.

pre_eclampsia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Late-term pre-eclampsia
  presenting_complaint: Routine 40-week check-up found high blood pressure.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old healthy multiparous woman presented at term for a routine check. BP was 160/100 mmHg with 2+ proteinuria; she was previously normotensive throughout the pregnancy. She was admitted for induction of labour, which resulted in a healthy vaginal delivery, and her blood pressure normalised within 72 hours.

pre_eclampsia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent pre-eclampsia
  presenting_complaint: Rising blood pressure at 32 weeks despite aspirin prophylaxis.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old woman with a history of severe pre-eclampsia in her first pregnancy was started on 150mg aspirin daily from 12 weeks. Despite this, her BP rose to 150/98 mmHg at 32 weeks with emerging proteinuria. She was started on nifedipine and monitored closely as an outpatient to prolong the pregnancy toward 36 weeks.

pre_eclampsia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Pre-eclampsia with neurological irritability
  presenting_complaint: Hyperreflexia and clonus noted on routine exam.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old primigravida at 38 weeks gestation was found to have a BP of 155/105 mmHg. Physical examination revealed 4 beats of clonus and brisk patellar reflexes, suggesting significant central nervous system irritability. She was admitted for magnesium sulphate infusion to prevent eclamptic seizures and underwent successful induction of labour.

pre_eclampsia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Pre-eclampsia superimposed on CKD
  presenting_complaint: Worsening proteinuria in a patient with known renal disease.
  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old with CKD stage 3 (baseline creatinine 130 umol/L) at 24 weeks gestation showed a rise in PCR from 150 mg/mmol to 400 mg/mmol. Distinguishing between CKD progression and superimposed pre-eclampsia proved challenging, but rising BP and low PLGF levels confirmed the diagnosis. She was managed in a tertiary renal-obstetric clinic.

pre_eclampsia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Pre-eclampsia with gestational diabetes
  presenting_complaint: Routine screening for pre-eclampsia in a high-risk patient.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old on insulin for GDM was identified as having a BP of 152/96 mmHg at 35 weeks. Her proteinuria was 1+ and she had mild swelling of the hands. The combination of metabolic and hypertensive risk factors led to an elective delivery at 37 weeks to mitigate the risk of stillbirth and maternal complications.

pre_eclampsia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute pre-eclampsia
  presenting_complaint: Persistent nausea and "feeling unwell" at 36 weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old woman presented with vague symptoms of malaise and nausea. Initial BP was borderline at 142/92 mmHg, but serial bloods showed a doubling of ALT and a creeping PCR of 45 mg/mmol over three days. She was diagnosed with a subacute presentation of pre-eclampsia and scheduled for induction of labour at 37 weeks.

pre_eclampsia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe pre-eclampsia with cerebral haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset "thunderclap" headache and loss of consciousness.
  summary_of_course: A 37-year-old woman at 32 weeks gestation with untreated hypertension presented in a coma. CT head showed a large intraparenchymal haemorrhage; her BP on admission was 220/140 mmHg. This catastrophic presentation of severe pre-eclampsia required neurosurgical decompression and emergency delivery, leaving the patient with significant long-term neurological deficits.
