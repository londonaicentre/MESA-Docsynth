  presenting_complaint: Sudden-onset, tearing chest pain radiating to the back.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old male with known Marfan syndrome presented acutely to the ED with hypertensive crisis and severe retrosternal pain. CT aortogram confirmed a Stanford Type A dissection involving the ascending aorta. He underwent emergency Bentall procedure with a mechanical valve conduit and remains in ICU for post-operative monitoring.

marfan_syndrome_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Ectopia Lentis
  presenting_complaint: Progressive blurring of vision and worsening myopia.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female with a family history of Marfan syndrome presented to ophthalmology with bilateral visual disturbance. Slit-lamp examination revealed superior-temporal subluxation of the crystalline lenses. She underwent bilateral lensectomy and intraocular lens implantation with significant improvement in visual acuity.

marfan_syndrome_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Neonatal Marfan Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Respiratory distress and multiple congenital contractures at birth.
  summary_of_course: A neonate presented with severe valvular regurgitation, redundant skin, and long, thin fingers. Echocardiography showed massive dilatation of the aortic root and mitral valve prolapse with severe regurgitation. Despite aggressive medical management in the NICU, the infant succumbed to progressive heart failure at three months of age.

marfan_syndrome_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Marfan Syndrome with Spontaneous Pneumothorax
  presenting_complaint: Acute pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old tall, thin male presented to A&E with sudden-onset unilateral chest pain. Chest X-ray confirmed a 30% primary spontaneous pneumothorax; CT thorax revealed apical bullae characteristic of Marfan-related lung disease. He was treated with a chest drain and subsequently underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for pleurodesis.

marfan_syndrome_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Dural Ectasia
  presenting_complaint: Chronic lower back pain and intermittent radiculopathy.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old woman with Marfan syndrome, previously stable, reported worsening lumbosacral pain and headaches that improved when lying down. MRI of the spine demonstrated significant widening of the neural canal and scalloping of the posterior vertebral bodies, confirming dural ectasia. Management was conservative with specialist pain team input and physiotherapy.

marfan_syndrome_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Marfan Syndrome in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Pre-conception counselling and monitoring during third trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old pregnant female with Marfan syndrome and a baseline aortic root of 3.9cm was monitored closely with monthly echocardiograms. At 36 weeks, the aortic root remained stable, and she underwent a planned elective Caesarean section under regional anaesthesia to avoid the haemodynamic stress of labour. Both mother and neonate remained stable post-partum.

marfan_syndrome_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Scoliosis in Marfan Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Progressive spinal deformity and difficulty sitting upright.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old girl with Marfan syndrome presented with a Cobb angle of 55 degrees on spinal radiography. Despite bracing, the curvature progressed rapidly during her pubic growth spurt, necessitating posterior spinal fusion. Post-operative recovery was complicated by slow wound healing but resulted in improved posture and respiratory function.

marfan_syndrome_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Mitral Valve Prolapse with Severe Regurgitation
  presenting_complaint: Exertional dyspnoea and palpitations.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with a known FBN1 mutation presented with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III heart failure symptoms. Echocardiography showed bileaflet mitral valve prolapse with a "flail" segment and severe eccentric regurgitation. He underwent successful mitral valve repair with an annuloplasty ring and has since returned to baseline activity.

marfan_syndrome_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Marfan Syndrome with Chronic Aortic Dissection
  presenting_complaint: Routine follow-up for a known Type B dissection.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with Marfan syndrome and a history of a Type B dissection managed medically for five years presented for review. Serial CT imaging showed the false lumen was stable at 4.2cm, but he developed new-onset atrial fibrillation. He was commenced on Bisoprolol and Apixaban, with continued strict blood pressure targets below 120/80 mmHg.

marfan_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Late-onset Marfan Syndrome Diagnosis
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of aortic aneurysm on CT for abdominal pain.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with no prior significant history was found to have a 4.8cm ascending aortic aneurysm on a CT scan performed for suspected cholecystitis. Clinical examination revealed mild pectus carinatum and a positive wrist sign, leading to a late diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. Genetic testing confirmed a de novo FBN1 mutation, and he was referred for elective aortic root replacement.

marfan_syndrome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Marfan Syndrome with Recurrent Inguinal Hernias
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral groin lumps and discomfort.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old man with Marfan syndrome presented with his third recurrence of bilateral inguinal hernias despite previous mesh repairs. His clinical profile highlighted the significant connective tissue fragility associated with FBN1 mutations. He underwent a complex tension-free repair with a larger biological mesh and was advised on strict lifting restrictions.

marfan_syndrome_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Marfan Syndrome with Sleep Apnoea
  presenting_complaint: Excessive daytime somnolence and heavy snoring.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male with Marfan syndrome and retrognathia was referred to the sleep clinic. Polysomnography confirmed severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) with an AHI of 35. He was successfully treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, which also helped in managing his nocturnal blood pressure surges.

marfan_syndrome_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Marfan Syndrome with Rapid Aortic Root Expansion
  presenting_complaint: Significant increase in aortic diameter on surveillance echo.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old female on Losartan therapy showed an increase in aortic root diameter from 4.1cm to 4.6cm within 12 months. Due to the rapid rate of expansion (>0.5cm/year) and a strong family history of dissection, she was fast-tracked for a valve-sparing aortic root replacement (David procedure). The surgery was successful, preserving her native aortic valve.

marfan_syndrome_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Marfan Syndrome with Striae Atrophicae
  presenting_complaint: Extensive skin markings on shoulders and lower back.
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old male presented with significant psychological distress regarding widespread, unexplained stretch marks. Clinical evaluation noted these were striae atrophicae occurring in the absence of weight gain or steroid use, which, alongside his 205cm height, prompted a Marfan syndrome workup. Diagnosis was confirmed via systemic score (>7) and subsequent genetic testing.

marfan_syndrome_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Marfan Syndrome with Infective Endocarditis
  presenting_complaint: Fever, night sweats, and a new heart murmur.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female with Marfan syndrome and a known mitral valve prolapse presented with subacute bacterial endocarditis. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridans, likely following recent dental work without antibiotic prophylaxis. She required a six-week course of IV Benzylpenicillin and Gentamicin, narrowly avoiding the need for emergency valve replacement.

marfan_syndrome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Marfan Syndrome with Chronic Pain Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Widespread musculoskeletal pain and joint hypermobility.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old woman with Marfan syndrome struggled with chronic polyarthralgia and frequent joint subluxations. Her Beighton score was 8/9, indicating significant hypermobility. She was managed through a multidisciplinary approach involving hydrotherapy, orthotics for pes planus, and low-dose Amitriptyline for neuropathic pain.

marfan_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Marfan Syndrome with Carotid Artery Dissection
  presenting_complaint: Sudden-onset headache and Horner's syndrome.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with Marfan syndrome presented with a painful right-sided miosis and ptosis. MRA of the neck confirmed a spontaneous internal carotid artery dissection. He was treated with anticoagulation and strict blood pressure control, with no subsequent neurological deficits or stroke.

marfan_syndrome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Marfan Syndrome with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm
  presenting_complaint: Pulsatile abdominal mass found during routine physical.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with Marfan syndrome, who had previously undergone a Bentall procedure, was found to have a 5.5cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Given his Marfan status, the threshold for intervention was lowered, and he underwent an open AAA repair. His recovery was prolonged by an incisional hernia, common in this patient group.

marfan_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Marfan Syndrome with High-Arched Palate and Dental Crowding
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty with speech and severe dental malocclusion.
  summary_of_course: An 11-year-old girl was referred to orthodontics for a narrow, high-arched palate and significant crowding. The orthodontist suspected an underlying connective tissue disorder due to her long limbs and referred her to clinical genetics. She was subsequently diagnosed with Marfan syndrome and commenced on a long-term orthodontic plan alongside cardiac monitoring.
