iron_deficiency_anaemia_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild iron deficiency anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female presented to her GP with a six-month history of worsening lethargy and menorrhagia. Blood tests revealed a haemoglobin (Hb) of 105 g/L and ferritin of 8 μg/L, confirming mild microcytic anaemia. She was started on oral ferrous fumarate 322mg twice daily and advised on menstrual management, resulting in Hb normalisation within three months.

iron_deficiency_anaemia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe iron deficiency anaemia secondary to malignancy
  presenting_complaint: Rectal bleeding and profound weakness
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male presented with a three-month history of altered bowel habit and weight loss. Investigations showed a Hb of 62 g/L and iron studies consistent with severe depletion (ferritin 4 μg/L). Urgent colonoscopy identified a caecal adenocarcinoma; he received two units of packed red cells and IV iron (ferric carboxymaltose) prior to hemicolectomy.

iron_deficiency_anaemia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric nutritional iron deficiency anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Pallor and irritability
  summary_of_course: An 18-month-old toddler was brought to the paediatric assessment unit due to excessive tiredness and poor appetite. History revealed a diet dominated by cow's milk (>1 litre/day) with minimal solids; Hb was 74 g/L with significant microcytosis. Treatment involved dietary modification and oral iron supplementation (Sytron), with rapid improvement in energy levels and haematological parameters.

iron_deficiency_anaemia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Iron deficiency anaemia post-gastric bypass
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent dizziness and pica
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female, five years post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, reported a persistent craving for chewing ice (pagophagia). Despite oral iron supplements, her Hb remained 98 g/L and ferritin was 10 μg/L, suggesting malabsorption. She was transitioned to six-monthly IV iron infusions, which successfully maintained her Hb within the reference range.

iron_deficiency_anaemia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Iron deficiency anaemia of pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Routine screening at 28 weeks gestation
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant woman in her third trimester was found to have a Hb of 102 g/L during routine antenatal checks. Although asymptomatic, her ferritin was low at 12 μg/L, indicating depleted stores due to increased foetal demand. She was prescribed oral ferrous sulfate and monitored closely, avoiding the need for peripartum transfusion.

iron_deficiency_anaemia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic iron deficiency anaemia secondary to Coeliac disease
  presenting_complaint: Unexplained anaemia and bloating
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male was referred to haematology for refractory microcytic anaemia (Hb 110 g/L) that failed to respond to oral iron. Further screening showed positive anti-TTG antibodies, and a duodenal biopsy confirmed Coeliac disease (Marsh 3c). A gluten-free diet combined with initial IV iron replacement resolved the anaemia and gastrointestinal symptoms.

iron_deficiency_anaemia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic iron deficiency anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Melena and syncope
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with known chronic low-grade anaemia presented to A&E after passing black, tarry stools. Admission Hb was 55 g/L, down from a baseline of 95 g/L, with a ferritin of 6 μg/L. Endoscopy revealed a bleeding peptic ulcer secondary to long-term NSAID use; he was treated with endoscopic clipping, IV PPI, and blood transfusion.

iron_deficiency_anaemia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Functional iron deficiency in Chronic Kidney Disease
  presenting_complaint: Progressive exertional dyspnoea
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old patient with Stage 4 CKD and anaemia of chronic disease developed functional iron deficiency (ferritin 150 μg/L but TSAT 15%) while on Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents (ESA). The lack of available iron limited the effectiveness of ESA therapy. Regular IV iron sucrose was initiated to optimise erythropoiesis, successfully raising Hb from 88 g/L to 112 g/L.

iron_deficiency_anaemia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening iron deficiency anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Chest pain and high-output heart failure
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female presented with orthopnoea and tachycardia; admission Hb was critically low at 38 g/L due to chronic occult GI loss from angiodysplasia. She was admitted to the High Dependency Unit for cautious top-up transfusions and IV iron to avoid fluid overload. Following stabilisation, her cardiac symptoms resolved and Hb was maintained with oral supplements.

iron_deficiency_anaemia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Iron deficiency anaemia secondary to IBD
  presenting_complaint: Bloody diarrhoea and fatigue
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female with a known flare of Ulcerative Colitis presented with a Hb of 92 g/L. Oral iron was avoided as it often exacerbates IBD symptoms and is poorly absorbed during active inflammation. She received IV ferric carboxymaltose (1000mg), which was well-tolerated and improved both her anaemia and quality of life scores.

iron_deficiency_anaemia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Iron deficiency anaemia due to hookworm infestation
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal pain and lethargy post-travel
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male returned from a six-month humanitarian trip to rural Southeast Asia with eosinophilia and a microcytic anaemia (Hb 85 g/L). Stool microscopy confirmed Necator americanus infection causing chronic intestinal blood loss. He was treated with a course of albendazole and oral iron, leading to complete haematological recovery.

iron_deficiency_anaemia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Iron deficiency anaemia secondary to frequent blood donation
  presenting_complaint: Persistent tiredness
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old regular blood donor (4 times/year) was found to have a Hb of 118 g/L and a ferritin of 9 μg/L during a donor screening session. Despite a healthy diet, the frequency of donation exceeded his iron absorption capacity. He was advised to cease donations for six months and complete a course of oral iron to replenish stores.

iron_deficiency_anaemia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Iron-Refractory Iron Deficiency Anaemia (IRIDA)
  presenting_complaint: Childhood-onset anaemia unresponsive to iron
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy had a lifelong history of mild microcytic anaemia (Hb 90-100 g/L) and very low TSAT, despite high-dose oral and repeated IV iron. Genetic testing identified a mutation in the TMPRSS6 gene, confirming IRIDA. Management focused on maintaining a functional Hb level via specialist haematology input, acknowledging the limited response to conventional iron therapy.

iron_deficiency_anaemia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Iron deficiency anaemia secondary to angiodysplasia
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent melena and anaemia
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old female with aortic stenosis (Heyde's syndrome) presented with recurrent episodes of IDA (Hb 80 g/L, ferritin 11 μg/L). Capsule endoscopy identified multiple small bowel angiodysplasias. Due to her frailty, she was managed with regular outpatient IV iron infusions and tranexamic acid to control the chronic blood loss.

iron_deficiency_anaemia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate iron deficiency anaemia (dietary)
  presenting_complaint: Brittle nails and hair loss
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old vegan university student presented with thinning hair and koilonychia (spoon-shaped nails). Bloods confirmed IDA with a Hb of 94 g/L and ferritin of 5 μg/L, attributed to a poorly planned plant-based diet. She was referred to a dietitian and started on ferrous sulfate, with significant symptomatic improvement within six weeks.

iron_deficiency_anaemia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-operative iron deficiency anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Delayed recovery following total hip replacement
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with a pre-operative Hb of 130 g/L experienced significant intra-operative blood loss, resulting in a post-op Hb of 82 g/L. To avoid the risks of transfusion and accelerate recovery, he was given a single dose of IV iron on the ward. By his six-week follow-up, his Hb had risen to 115 g/L and his mobility was progressing well.

iron_deficiency_anaemia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Iron deficiency anaemia with restless legs syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Disturbed sleep and leg discomfort
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female presented primarily with severe restless legs syndrome (RLS) and mild fatigue. Investigations revealed a borderline Hb of 118 g/L but a significantly low ferritin of 14 μg/L. Iron supplementation was initiated specifically to treat the RLS; once her ferritin rose above 75 μg/L, her neurological symptoms resolved completely.

iron_deficiency_anaemia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Iron deficiency anaemia secondary to hiatus hernia (Cameron ulcers)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic iron deficiency and dyspepsia
  summary_of_course: A 76-year-old male with a large sliding hiatus hernia presented with persistent IDA (Hb 90 g/L) despite oral iron. Gastroscopy identified linear erosions (Cameron ulcers) within the hernia sac. He was treated with high-dose PPIs and IV iron, and eventually underwent laparoscopic hiatus hernia repair, which cured the chronic blood loss.

iron_deficiency_anaemia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute iron deficiency anaemia (non-compliance)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent anaemia and GI intolerance
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female with menorrhagia failed to improve her Hb (remained at 92 g/L) because she stopped oral ferrous sulfate due to severe constipation and nausea. She was switched to an alternate-day dosing regimen of ferrous gluconate, which was better tolerated. This approach successfully increased her Hb to 122 g/L over four months.

iron_deficiency_anaemia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Iron deficiency anaemia secondary to Schistosomiasis
  presenting_complaint: Haematuria and fatigue
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old male who recently emigrated from Malawi presented with terminal haematuria and a Hb of 108 g/L. Urine microscopy showed Schistosoma haematobium eggs, and iron studies confirmed deficiency (ferritin 15 μg/L). He was treated with praziquantel and a short course of oral iron, leading to resolution of both the infection and the anaemia.
