gestational_diabetes_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild gestational diabetes mellitus
  presenting_complaint: Routine screening at 26 weeks gestation
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old primigravida with a BMI of 24 underwent a routine oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Results showed a 2-hour plasma glucose of 8.2 mmol/L, meeting NICE criteria for GDM. She was managed successfully with dietary modifications and regular physical activity, maintaining capillary blood glucose levels within target throughout the remainder of her pregnancy.

gestational_diabetes_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Early-onset gestational diabetes mellitus
  presenting_complaint: Booking bloods showing elevated HbA1c
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old woman with a history of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and a BMI of 34 presented at 12 weeks gestation. Booking HbA1c was 44 mmol/mol, and a subsequent OGTT confirmed early GDM. She was commenced on Metformin 500mg BD, which effectively stabilised her glycaemic profile until delivery at 38 weeks.

gestational_diabetes_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe gestational diabetes with polyhydramnios
  presenting_complaint: Increased symphysis-fundal height (SFH) at 32 weeks
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old multiparous patient presented with an SFH measuring 4cm ahead of dates. Ultrasound confirmed polyhydramnios and fetal macrosomia (abdominal circumference >95th centile). Despite Metformin, her fasting glucose remained >6.0 mmol/L, necessitating the introduction of subcutaneous Isophane insulin at bedtime.

gestational_diabetes_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Gestational diabetes presenting as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
  presenting_complaint: Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain at 28 weeks
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old woman with no prior history presented acutely to the emergency department in a confused state. Investigations revealed a capillary blood glucose of 22.0 mmol/L, pH 7.1, and ketones of 5.2 mmol/L. She was managed on the UK DKA protocol and transitioned to a basal-bolus insulin regimen for the duration of her pregnancy.

gestational_diabetes_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Gestational diabetes complicated by pre-eclampsia
  presenting_complaint: New-onset hypertension and proteinuria at 36 weeks
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old patient with GDM previously controlled on Metformin developed a blood pressure of 155/98 mmHg and 2+ proteinuria. Due to the combined risks of pre-eclampsia and escalating glucose levels, she was admitted for stabilisation and underwent an elective induction of labour at 37 weeks.

gestational_diabetes_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Diagnostic challenge in borderline gestational diabetes
  presenting_complaint: Large for gestational age (LGA) fetus on growth scan
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old woman had a borderline OGTT at 24 weeks (fasting 5.1 mmol/L, 2-hour 7.6 mmol/L). Despite negative screening, serial scans at 30 weeks showed accelerated fetal growth. Home glucose monitoring was initiated, revealing significant post-prandial spikes, leading to a late diagnosis of GDM and commencement of insulin.

gestational_diabetes_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Treatment-resistant gestational diabetes
  presenting_complaint: Persistent hyperglycaemia despite maximum oral therapy
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old woman with a BMI of 42 failed to achieve glycaemic targets on maximum doses of Metformin and Glibenclamide. Her fasting sugars remained consistently above 7.0 mmol/L. She required high-dose soluble insulin (Actrapid) with meals and long-acting analogue insulin (Levemir) to achieve control.

gestational_diabetes_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Gestational diabetes in high-risk ethnicity
  presenting_complaint: Routine 24-week OGTT screening
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old South Asian woman with a BMI of 22 (low for GDM risk) tested positive on OGTT with a 2-hour result of 9.5 mmol/L. Due to the high ethnic predisposition, she was monitored closely. Her glucose levels were highly sensitive to carbohydrate intake, requiring strict dietetic input and eventually low-dose Metformin.

gestational_diabetes_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Gestational diabetes in twin pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly increasing insulin requirements at 30 weeks
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old carrying dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) twins was diagnosed with GDM at 24 weeks. Due to the increased placental mass and hormonal antagonism, her insulin requirements tripled over a four-week period. She was managed by the joint obstetric-endocrine clinic with weekly dose adjustments.

gestational_diabetes_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent gestational diabetes
  presenting_complaint: Early self-monitoring in third pregnancy
  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old with two previous GDM pregnancies began home glucose monitoring at 8 weeks gestation. Persistent fasting hyperglycaemia (>5.3 mmol/L) was noted by 10 weeks. She was started on insulin earlier than in previous pregnancies, resulting in a healthy birth weight infant and no neonatal hypoglycaemia.

gestational_diabetes_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Steroid-induced gestational diabetes
  presenting_complaint: Hyperglycaemia following asthma exacerbation
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old at 24 weeks gestation was prescribed a five-day course of Prednisolone for acute asthma. Subsequent capillary glucose readings rose to 15.0 mmol/L. She required a temporary sliding scale insulin infusion in hospital and remained on Metformin for the rest of the pregnancy as her glucose levels did not return to baseline.

gestational_diabetes_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Gestational diabetes in elderly primigravida
  presenting_complaint: Routine screening at 28 weeks
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old woman who conceived via IVF was diagnosed with GDM following an OGTT (2-hour 8.9 mmol/L). Given her age and increased risk of stillbirth, she was managed conservatively with diet but underwent elective induction of labour at 38+0 weeks.

gestational_diabetes_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Gestational diabetes uncovering Type 2 Diabetes
  presenting_complaint: Persistent postpartum hyperglycaemia
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old was diagnosed with severe GDM at 20 weeks requiring 60 units of insulin daily. Following delivery, her insulin was stopped, but a 6-week postpartum OGTT showed a fasting glucose of 7.8 mmol/L and HbA1c of 50 mmol/mol. She was formally diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and continued on Metformin.

gestational_diabetes_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Gestational diabetes with nocturnal hypoglycaemia
  presenting_complaint: Night sweats and tremors at 32 weeks
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old on bedtime Isophane insulin for GDM reported frequent episodes of nocturnal diaphoresis. 3 AM blood glucose checks confirmed hypoglycaemia (2.9 mmol/L). Her insulin dose was reduced, and she was advised on a late-night complex carbohydrate snack, which resolved the symptoms.

gestational_diabetes_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute gestational diabetes with glycosuria
  presenting_complaint: 3+ glycosuria on routine antenatal dipstick
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old at 20 weeks gestation presented with persistent glycosuria despite a normal booking HbA1c. An urgent OGTT confirmed GDM (2-hour 11.2 mmol/L). She was immediately started on a combination of Metformin and insulin due to the early presentation and degree of hyperglycaemia.

gestational_diabetes_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Late-presentation gestational diabetes
  presenting_complaint: Late booking at 29 weeks gestation
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old woman with limited access to healthcare booked late in her third trimester. Screening OGTT was significantly abnormal (2-hour 13.0 mmol/L). Despite the late start to treatment, intensive insulin therapy was used to reduce the risk of macrosomia, though the infant was born at the 91st centile.

gestational_diabetes_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Gestational diabetes in morbid obesity
  presenting_complaint: High-risk pregnancy management
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old with a BMI of 48 and previous bariatric surgery presented at 16 weeks. OGTT was avoided due to risk of dumping syndrome; instead, home glucose monitoring was used. She demonstrated significant insulin resistance requiring a U-500 highly concentrated insulin regimen to maintain euglycaemia.

gestational_diabetes_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Gestational diabetes with shoulder dystocia
  presenting_complaint: Difficult vaginal delivery at 40 weeks
  summary_of_course: A 37-year-old with diet-controlled GDM opted for expectant management. During labour at 40+2 weeks, she experienced a significant shoulder dystocia requiring the McRoberts manoeuvre and internal rotations. The neonate weighed 4.6kg and required admission to the SCBU for monitoring of transient neonatal hypoglycaemia.

gestational_diabetes_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Gestational diabetes presenting with candidiasis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent vaginal thrush at 24 weeks
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old woman complained of persistent vaginal itching and discharge unresponsive to over-the-counter Clotrimazole. Clinical suspicion of underlying hyperglycaemia led to an OGTT, which returned a 2-hour result of 10.1 mmol/L. Once her GDM was controlled with diet and Metformin, the candidiasis resolved completely.

gestational_diabetes_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Gestational diabetes in Cystic Fibrosis
  presenting_complaint: Worsening glycaemic control in known CF patient
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old with Cystic Fibrosis and previously normal glucose tolerance became pregnant. By 20 weeks, she developed GDM (CFRD-GDM overlap). Management was complex due to her high caloric requirements for CF, necessitating a flexible insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio regimen to balance maternal nutrition and fetal growth.
