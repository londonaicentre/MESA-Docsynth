Subsequent GP investigations revealed a serum creatinine of 135 µmol/L (eGFR 48 mL/min/1.73m²) and mild albuminuria (ACR 15 mg/mmol). He was started on Ramipril and Amlodipine, resulting in stabilised renal function over 12 months in the community setting.

  primary_diagnosis: Refractory hypertension with progressive renal decline
  presenting_complaint: Persistent high BP despite four antihypertensive agents
  summary_of_course: A 49-year-old male remained hypertensive (170/105 mmHg) despite taking Ramipril, Amlodipine, Indapamide, and Doxazosin. His eGFR declined from 60 to 42 mL/min/1.73m² over 18 months. Secondary causes were ruled out, and he was referred to a specialist hypertension clinic for consideration of Spironolactone and further renal protection.

  primary_diagnosis: Hypertensive renal disease with superimposed NSAID-induced AKI
  presenting_complaint: Oliguria and epigastric pain
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old with chronic hypertension and OA was taking Ibuprofen daily. He presented with a BP of 190/95 mmHg and a creatinine of 380 µmol/L (baseline 120). The combination of hypertensive damage and NSAID-related vasoconstriction led to acute tubular necrosis, requiring hospitalisation for IV fluids and drug cessation.

  primary_diagnosis: Hypertensive encephalopathy and acute renal dysfunction
  presenting_complaint: Seizures and altered consciousness
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male with previously undiagnosed hypertension was brought to ICU following a tonic-clonic seizure. BP was 250/140 mmHg and MRI brain showed posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).

  presenting_complaint: Weight gain and swollen legs
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male with Stage 4 hypertensive CKD presented to the renal clinic with a 5kg weight gain. He was found to be in fluid overload due to excessive salt intake and suboptimal BP control (165/88 mmHg). His Furosemide dose was increased and he was counselled on dietary sodium restriction to manage his cardiorenal symptoms.

  primary_diagnosis: Post-preeclampsia hypertensive renal disease
  presenting_complaint: Persistent hypertension 6 months postpartum
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old female who had severe preeclampsia during pregnancy remained hypertensive (150/95 mmHg) post-delivery. Persistence of proteinuria (ACR 40 mg/mmol) and an eGFR of 70 mL/min/1.73m² suggested underlying hypertensive renal damage unmasked by pregnancy. She was started on Enalapril with close nephrology follow-up.

  primary_diagnosis: Hypertensive nephrosclerosis with uraemic pericarditis
  presenting_complaint: Pleuritic chest pain and friction rub
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male who had avoided medical care for years presented with severe chest pain. BP was 225/120 mmHg and bloods showed a creatinine of 1100 µmol/L. An ECG and echocardiogram confirmed uraemic pericarditis, a life-threatening complication of neglected hypertensive renal disease, requiring emergency dialysis.

  presenting_complaint: Early-onset hypertension in a young adult
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female was found to have a BP of 180/110 mmHg and suppressed renin/aldosterone levels. Genetic testing confirmed Liddle syndrome. Despite her young age, renal ultrasound showed cortical thinning and a creatinine of 110 µmol/L, indicating early hypertensive renal damage, which responded specifically to Amiloride.

hypertensive_renal_disease_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Scleroderma renal crisis mimicking hypertensive emergency
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly worsening renal function and skin thickening
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female with Raynaud's presented with a BP of 210/115 mmHg and a creatinine of 250 µmol/L. Although initially appearing as primary hypertensive renal disease, the presence of sclerodactyly led to a diagnosis of scleroderma renal crisis. She was treated with high-dose ACE inhibitors, which are critical in this specific hypertensive renal emergency.
