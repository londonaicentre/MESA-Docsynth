hydrocephalus_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Congenital Aqueductal Stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly increasing head circumference and bulging fontanelle.
  summary_of_course: A 4-month-old male infant presented to the paediatric clinic with macrocephaly and a "setting-sun" eye sign. Cranial ultrasound and subsequent MRI confirmed severe triventricular ventriculomegaly with a narrow aqueduct of Sylvius. The patient underwent a successful ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion, resulting in stabilisation of head growth and normalisation of intracranial pressure.

hydrocephalus_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (iNPH)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive gait instability, urinary incontinence, and cognitive decline.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old female presented with a 12-month history of "magnetic gait" and mild memory impairment. A CT head showed ventriculomegaly out of proportion to cortical atrophy (Evans index 0.35). Following a positive lumbar drain trial which showed significant gait improvement, a programmable ventriculoperitoneal shunt was fitted, leading to marked improvement in mobility.

hydrocephalus_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Post-Haemorrhagic Hydrocephalus
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset "thunderclap" headache followed by declining GCS.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male was admitted to A&E with a ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm. CT scan revealed Fisher Grade 4 subarachnoid haemorrhage with acute obstructive hydrocephalus. An emergency external ventricular drain (EVD) was placed in the ICU to manage intracranial hypertension before definitive coiling of the aneurysm.

hydrocephalus_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Tuberculous Meningitis with Communicating Hydrocephalus
  presenting_complaint: Chronic headache, low-grade fever, and neck stiffness.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male recently arrived from a TB-endemic region presented with subacute meningitis. CSF analysis showed lymphocytosis, low glucose, and high protein, while MRI demonstrated basal meningeal enhancement and communicating hydrocephalus. He was started on anti-tuberculous chemotherapy and dexamethasone, with a temporary lumbar drain required for CSF diversion.

hydrocephalus_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Malfunction
  presenting_complaint: Severe headache, projectile vomiting, and photophobia.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old female with a history of spina bifida and a long-standing VP shunt presented acutely unwell.

She underwent emergency shunt revision surgery with immediate resolution of symptoms.

hydrocephalus_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Obstructive Hydrocephalus due to Colloid Cyst
  presenting_complaint: Episodic "drop attacks" and paroxysmal headaches.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male presented with sudden-onset severe headaches that were relieved by lying flat. MRI Brain revealed a 12mm colloid cyst at the foramen of Monro causing acute obstructive hydrocephalus of the lateral ventricles. He underwent urgent endoscopic resection of the cyst, which restored normal CSF flow and prevented further episodes.

hydrocephalus_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Slit Ventricle Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Chronic intermittent headaches worsened by standing.
  summary_of_course: An 18-year-old female with a childhood VP shunt for hydrocephalus presented with debilitating headaches. Imaging showed very small, "slit-like" ventricles despite clinical features of raised intracranial pressure. Management involved upgrading her shunt to include an anti-siphon valve and a higher-pressure setting to prevent over-drainage.

hydrocephalus_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Chiari I Malformation with Syringomyelia and Hydrocephalus
  presenting_complaint: Occipital headaches and progressive hand weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old male was referred for neurosurgical assessment after an MRI for headaches showed cerebellar tonsillar herniation of 12mm. The imaging also revealed associated hydrocephalus and a large cervical syrinx. He underwent posterior fossa decompression and duraplasty, which successfully reduced the ventricular size and improved his neurological symptoms.

hydrocephalus_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-Traumatic Hydrocephalus
  presenting_complaint: Failure to progress during neuro-rehabilitation following head injury.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male sustained a severe traumatic brain injury in a road traffic accident. Three months into recovery, his GCS plateaued and he developed new-onset urinary incontinence. A repeat CT head showed progressive ventriculomegaly with periventricular lucency, and he was successfully treated with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.

hydrocephalus_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Obstructive Hydrocephalus due to Medulloblastoma
  presenting_complaint: Early morning vomiting and truncal ataxia.
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old girl presented with a two-week history of worsening balance and nausea. MRI revealed a large midline posterior fossa mass compressing the fourth ventricle, causing significant upstream hydrocephalus. She received emergency dexamethasone and an EVD followed by surgical resection of the medulloblastoma.

hydrocephalus_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Infection
  presenting_complaint: Fever, abdominal pain, and lethargy.
  summary_of_course: A 9-month-old infant, shunted for post-haemorrhagic hydrocephalus, presented with a low-grade fever and erythema over the shunt tract. CSF sampled from the shunt reservoir showed Staphylococcus epidermidis growth. The entire shunt system was externalised, the patient was treated with intravenous vancomycin, and a new shunt was inserted once CSF cultures were clear.

hydrocephalus_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Arrested Hydrocephalus
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding on CT following minor head trauma.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male underwent a CT head after a fall, which showed significant ventriculomegaly but no acute pathology. Detailed history revealed no gait, cognitive, or urinary issues, and ophthalmoscopy showed no papilloedema. He was diagnosed with arrested hydrocephalus from childhood and managed conservatively with annual clinical reviews.

hydrocephalus_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus
  presenting_complaint: Worsening cognitive impairment and shuffling gait.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old female with a history of a subarachnoid haemorrhage ten years prior developed progressive mobility issues. MRI showed ventriculomegaly with a disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space (DESH). A lumbar infusion test confirmed high outflow resistance, and she responded well to the placement of a fixed-pressure VP shunt.

hydrocephalus_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-Haemorrhagic Hydrocephalus of Prematurity
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly increasing head circumference in a neonate.
  summary_of_course: A preterm infant born at 27 weeks gestation developed a Grade IV intraventricular haemorrhage on day 3 of life. Serial cranial ultrasounds showed progressive ventricular dilatation despite conservative management. A ventricular access device was initially used for CSF tapping before a formal VP shunt was placed once the infant reached 2.5kg.

hydrocephalus_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-Meningitic Communicating Hydrocephalus
  presenting_complaint: Persistent headache and blurred vision following recovery from meningitis.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female was treated for Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis. Two weeks after discharge, she returned with symptoms of raised intracranial pressure and papilloedema. Imaging confirmed communicating hydrocephalus due to impaired CSF absorption at the arachnoid granulations, necessitating the insertion of a lumboperitoneal shunt.

hydrocephalus_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Obstructive Hydrocephalus due to Pineal Germinoma
  presenting_complaint: Upward gaze palsy and headaches.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male presented with Parinaud’s syndrome and signs of raised intracranial pressure. MRI showed a pineal region tumour obstructing the cerebral aqueduct. He underwent an endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) to bypass the obstruction and a biopsy of the lesion, which confirmed a germinoma.

hydrocephalus_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Shunt Over-drainage with Subdural Haematomas
  presenting_complaint: Severe postural headache and new-onset confusion.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with a VP shunt for NPH presented with headaches that were worse when upright. A CT scan revealed bilateral chronic subdural haematomas and "brain sag." The management involved temporary bed rest, burr-hole drainage of the haematomas, and replacing the shunt valve with a programmable one set to a higher opening pressure.

hydrocephalus_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Multiloculated Hydrocephalus
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent shunt failures and focal neurological deficits.
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old boy with a history of neonatal E. coli ventriculitis presented with complex hydrocephalus consisting of multiple isolated CSF compartments. MRI demonstrated extensive intraventricular septations. He required neuro-endoscopic fenestration of the loculi to create a single cavity, followed by the placement of a multi-perforated ventricular catheter.

hydrocephalus_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Dandy-Walker Malformation with Hydrocephalus
  presenting_complaint: Developmental delay and enlarging head size.
  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old girl was diagnosed with a Dandy-Walker malformation, characterised by a large posterior fossa cyst and cerebellar vermis hypoplasia. Progressive hydrocephalus was noted on serial imaging along with increasing irritability. She was treated with a cystoperitoneal shunt, which successfully reduced the cyst volume and ventricular size.

hydrocephalus_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic Hydrocephalus due to ETV Failure
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of drowsiness and vomiting.
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old boy who had undergone an endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) three years prior for aqueductal stenosis presented acutely lethargic. A CT head showed acute ventricular dilatation compared to post-operative films. Emergency surgery revealed that the ETV stoma had closed with a thin membrane; a repeat ETV was performed with good clinical recovery.
