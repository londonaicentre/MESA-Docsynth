retinal_haemorrhage_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, painless loss of vision in the right eye.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with poorly controlled hypertension presented to A&E with a "blood and thunder" fundus appearance. Fundoscopy revealed extensive flame-shaped retinal haemorrhages in all four quadrants and optic disc oedema. He was started on intravitreal anti-VEGF injections with moderate visual recovery over six months.

retinal_haemorrhage_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of numerous dark floaters and blurred vision.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female with a 20-year history of Type 1 Diabetes presented to the eye clinic. Examination confirmed vitreous haemorrhage secondary to neovascularisation at the disc (NVD). She underwent urgent pan-retinal photocoagulation (PRP) to stabilise the ischaemic retina and prevent further bleeding.

retinal_haemorrhage_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Malignant Hypertension with Retinopathy
  presenting_complaint: Severe headache, nausea, and bilateral blurred vision.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male was admitted to the medical assessment unit with a blood pressure of 230/140 mmHg. Ophthalmoscopy showed Grade IV hypertensive retinopathy with bilateral papilloedema and multiple flame haemorrhages. His BP was cautiously lowered in the ICU, leading to a gradual resolution of the retinal findings.

retinal_haemorrhage_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Valsalva Retinopathy
  presenting_complaint: Large central blind spot after a bout of heavy lifting.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old weightlifter presented with a sudden scotoma in the left eye. Clinical examination revealed a large, well-circumscribed sub-hyaloid premacular haemorrhage. Due to the size of the bleed, Nd:YAG laser membranotomy was performed to drain the blood into the vitreous, resulting in rapid visual improvement.

retinal_haemorrhage_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Non-Accidental Injury (NAI)
  presenting_complaint: Lethargy and reduced responsiveness in an infant.
  summary_of_course: A 6-month-old infant was brought to the paediatric emergency department with suspected encephalopathy. Dilated fundoscopy revealed multi-layered retinal haemorrhages extending to the periphery in both eyes, raising suspicion of shaken baby syndrome. A CT head confirmed a subdural haematoma, and safeguarding protocols were initiated.

retinal_haemorrhage_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Retinal Artery Macroaneurysm (RAM)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, dense central vision loss in the right eye.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with chronic hypercholesterolaemia presented with a ruptured macroaneurysm along the superior temporal arcade. The rupture caused significant subretinal and intraretinal haemorrhage involving the fovea. She was managed conservatively with observation, but permanent macular scarring resulted in poor visual acuity.

retinal_haemorrhage_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Terson's Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Comatose state following a sudden severe headache.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female was admitted to neurosurgery with a Grade 4 subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) from a ruptured berry aneurysm. Bedside ophthalmoscopy identified bilateral vitreous and sub-hyaloid haemorrhages. Following neurosurgical clipping, she underwent a pars plana vitrectomy to clear the non-clearing vitreous blood.

retinal_haemorrhage_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Proliferative Sickle Cell Retinopathy
  presenting_complaint: Flashes and floaters in the peripheral vision.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male with Sickle Cell Disease (HbSC) presented for a routine ophthalmic screen. Examination showed peripheral "sea-fan" neovascularisation with associated localized retinal haemorrhages and tractional changes. Sectoral laser photocoagulation was applied to the ischaemic peripheral retina to prevent progression to a vitreous bleed.

retinal_haemorrhage_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration (nAMD)
  presenting_complaint: Distortion of straight lines (metamorphopsia) and central blurring.
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old female reported a rapid decline in her reading vision. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) confirmed a subretinal haemorrhage and pigment epithelial detachment (PED) secondary to choroidal neovascularisation. She was commenced on a "treat and extend" regimen of intravitreal Aflibercept.

retinal_haemorrhage_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Purtscher's Retinopathy
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral vision loss following a severe crushing chest injury.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male was involved in a road traffic accident resulting in thoracic trauma. Within 24 hours, he complained of reduced vision; fundoscopy showed multiple Purtscher flecks (ischaemic whitening) and scattered retinal haemorrhages around the optic discs. The condition was managed supportively, with partial visual recovery over several months.

retinal_haemorrhage_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Leukaemic Retinopathy
  presenting_complaint: Generalised malaise, easy bruising, and mild visual blurring.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female was referred from haematology following a new diagnosis of Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML). Fundus examination revealed multiple Roth spots (haemorrhages with white centres) and preretinal bleeds. The retinal findings resolved following successful induction chemotherapy and stabilisation of her full blood count.

retinal_haemorrhage_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO)
  presenting_complaint: A "smudge" in the upper field of vision in the left eye.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with a history of smoking and glaucoma presented with a segmental distribution of flame haemorrhages and cotton wool spots in the inferior temporal quadrant. Diagnosis of BRVO was made at the arteriovenous crossing. Macular oedema subsequently developed and was treated with a Dexamethasone intravitreal implant.

retinal_haemorrhage_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Infective Endocarditis
  presenting_complaint: Fever, night sweats, and a small spot in the vision.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old intravenous drug user was admitted with suspected sepsis and a new heart murmur. Ophthalmic review identified classic Roth spots in the mid-periphery of the left retina. Blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus, and the retinal haemorrhages served as a clinical marker for systemic embolization until the infection was cleared with antibiotics.

retinal_haemorrhage_014:
  primary_diagnosis: High Altitude Retinal Haemorrhage (HARH)
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic spots noted during a high-altitude expedition.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old mountaineer underwent a fundus check at a base camp (5,000m) as part of a research study. Multiple small, dot-and-blot haemorrhages were noted in the mid-periphery despite no visual symptoms. Upon descent to sea level, a follow-up examination four weeks later showed complete spontaneous resolution of the haemorrhages.

retinal_haemorrhage_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Anaemic Retinopathy
  presenting_complaint: Profound fatigue and blurred vision.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female with chronic menorrhagia presented with a haemoglobin level of 52 g/L. Fundoscopy revealed a pale fundus background with scattered flame-shaped haemorrhages and a few dot haemorrhages. Following a red cell transfusion and iron supplementation, her vision returned to baseline and the haemorrhages absorbed.

retinal_haemorrhage_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Eales Disease
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of floaters in a young adult.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male of South Asian descent presented with peripheral retinal perivasculitis and associated vitreous haemorrhage. Investigations for tuberculosis and sarcoidosis were negative, leading to a diagnosis of Eales disease. He was treated with systemic corticosteroids and peripheral laser photocoagulation to manage the recurrent bleeding.

retinal_haemorrhage_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Coat's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Noticed a "white glow" (leukocoria) in the left eye of a child.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy was referred by his school optician. Examination under anaesthesia revealed extensive telangiectatic retinal vessels with massive lipid exudation and scattered deep retinal haemorrhages. He underwent cryotherapy and laser photocoagulation to the abnormal vessels to prevent total exudative retinal detachment.

retinal_haemorrhage_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-Vitrectomy Recurrent Haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Sudden "red-out" of vision two days after eye surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male underwent a pars plana vitrectomy for a non-clearing vitreous haemorrhage. On post-operative day 2, he experienced a sudden recurrence of dense haemorrhage in the vitreous cavity. He was managed with head-of-bed elevation and temporary cessation of his aspirin, with the blood clearing over three weeks.

retinal_haemorrhage_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Ocular Ischaemic Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Dull aching pain in the eye and gradual vision loss.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male with known carotid artery disease presented with mid-peripheral dot-and-blot haemorrhages and dilated, non-tortuous retinal veins. Carotid Doppler confirmed 95% stenosis of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery. He was referred for urgent carotid endarterectomy to prevent further ocular and cerebral ischaemia.

retinal_haemorrhage_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Radiation Retinopathy
  presenting_complaint: Gradual decline in vision two years after cancer treatment.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female had previously undergone plaque brachytherapy for a choroidal melanoma. She presented with radiation-induced microangiopathy, characterised by telangiectasia, capillary non-perfusion, and multiple retinal haemorrhages. Despite intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, the ischaemia progressed, leading to significant permanent visual impairment.
