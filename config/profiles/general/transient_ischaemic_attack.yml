  primary_diagnosis: TIA Mimic (Hypoglycaemia)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset hemiparesis and slurred speech.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female with Type 1 Diabetes was brought in as a "Stroke Alert". Paramedics found a capillary blood glucose of 1.8 mmol/L; symptoms fully resolved within 5 minutes of IV glucose administration. Although initially suspected as a TIA, the rapid reversal with glucose confirmed a hypoglycaemic mimic.

transient_ischaemic_attack_010:
  primary_diagnosis: TIA with High-Grade Carotid Stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent transient expressive aphasia.
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old male experienced three episodes of speech arrest in one week. Carotid duplex revealed 90% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery. He underwent an urgent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) within 48 hours of the last TIA episode to prevent a major stroke.

transient_ischaemic_attack_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute TIA Presentation
  presenting_complaint: History of "clumsy hand" occurring three days ago.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female attended her GP reporting a 10-minute episode of right-hand weakness on Monday. By the time of the Friday appointment, she was asymptomatic. She was referred to the rapid-access TIA clinic, started on Aspirin 300mg immediately, and scheduled for an MRI brain.

transient_ischaemic_attack_012:
  primary_diagnosis: TIA in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Sudden loss of right-sided peripheral vision.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female in her third trimester presented with a transient homonymous hemianopia. Investigations focused on excluding pre-eclampsia and thrombophilia. MRI was clear, and she was managed with low-dose Aspirin and close obstetric monitoring for the remainder of her pregnancy.

transient_ischaemic_attack_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Capsular Warning Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Fluctuating episodes of pure motor hemiparesis.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male with poorly controlled hypertension had eight episodes of right-sided weakness over 12 hours, with full recovery between each. This was identified as Capsular Warning Syndrome, a high-risk variant of TIA involving small vessel lacunar ischaemia. He was managed with aggressive BP control and DAPT.

transient_ischaemic_attack_014:
  primary_diagnosis: TIA secondary to Infective Endocarditis
  presenting_complaint: Fever and transient left-sided weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male with a history of IV drug use presented with a 15-minute TIA. Examination revealed a new systolic murmur and splinter haemorrhages. Echocardiography showed a vegetation on the mitral valve, and he was started on IV antibiotics for infective endocarditis with embolic TIA.

transient_ischaemic_attack_015:
  primary_diagnosis: TIA on Anticoagulation
  presenting_complaint: Transient dysarthria despite taking Warfarin.
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old male with a metallic mitral valve presented with a 20-minute TIA. Admission INR was 1.6 (subtherapeutic target 2.5-3.5). He was bridged with LMWH until his INR was back in the therapeutic range, and his Warfarin dose was adjusted.

transient_ischaemic_attack_016:
  primary_diagnosis: TIA with Chronic Kidney Disease
  presenting_complaint: Transient right-sided sensory loss.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with Stage 4 CKD and multiple TIAs presented with a new sensory episode. Due to renal impairment, CTA was avoided, and MRA was used for vascular imaging. Antiplatelet therapy was carefully balanced against his high bleeding risk and renal function.

transient_ischaemic_attack_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-Operative TIA
  presenting_complaint: Transient right-sided weakness following CABG.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male experienced a 30-minute episode of hemiparesis on day 2 post-coronary artery bypass graft. CT head showed no acute bleed or infarct. The episode was attributed to a perioperative micro-embolism, and his post-surgical antiplatelet regimen was optimised.

transient_ischaemic_attack_018:
  primary_diagnosis: TIA vs Focal Seizure (Todd's Paresis)
  presenting_complaint: Right-sided jerking followed by 2 hours of weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female presented with transient weakness. The history of preceding limb jerking suggested a focal seizure with Todd's Paresis rather than a TIA. However, given her vascular risk factors, she underwent a full TIA workup, which was negative, and was subsequently referred to neurology for EEG.

transient_ischaemic_attack_019:
  primary_diagnosis: TIA in the setting of Giant Cell Arteritis
  presenting_complaint: Transient monocular vision loss and scalp tenderness.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old female presented with amaurosis fugax and a new headache. Elevated ESR (85 mm/hr) and CRP suggested Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA). She was started on high-dose Prednisolone immediately to prevent permanent visual loss from ischaemic optic neuropathy.
