Diagnosed with septicaemia secondary to burn wound infection; treated with IV flucloxacillin and silver sulfadiazine (Flamazine).

burn_or_scald_injury_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Friction burn (Road rash)
  presenting_complaint: Extensive skin loss on the lateral torso and limbs after a motorcycle accident.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male sustained deep friction burns involving 12% TBSA. Wounds were heavily contaminated with road debris and grit. Underwent formal debridement under GA to remove ingrained particles and prevent "traumatic tattooing," followed by application of Suprathel.

burn_or_scald_injury_012:

  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant female sustained a 4% TBSA partial-thickness burn. Management required multidisciplinary input from obstetrics to monitor foetal heart rate and ensure no distress. Wound care was performed using silver-free dressings (e.g., Mepitel) to avoid potential silver systemic absorption.

  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female developed a reaction to Lamotrigine, resulting in >30% TBSA skin detachment (Nikolsky sign positive). Managed in the burns unit as a "chemical-like" burn injury with intensive fluid replacement, skin protection with Allevyn, and IV Immunoglobulin (IVIG).

  primary_diagnosis: Post-burn contracture
  presenting_complaint: Restricted movement of the neck following an old burn injury.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male presented with a tight scar band (cicatrix) on the neck from a childhood scald. The contracture limited extension and rotation. Underwent elective scar release and a Z-plasty procedure to improve functional range of motion and cosmesis.
