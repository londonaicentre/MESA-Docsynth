systemic_sclerosis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (lcSSc)
  presenting_complaint: Raynaud’s phenomenon and skin thickening of the fingers
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented with a 2-year history of worsening Raynaud’s and recent onset of puffy fingers (dactylitis). Clinical examination revealed sclerodactyly and telangiectasia on the face and chest. Serology was positive for anti-centromere antibodies (ACA), and nailfold capillaroscopy showed dilated loops. She was commenced on nifedipine for vasospasm and remains stable in the outpatient clinic.

systemic_sclerosis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc)
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive skin tightening and shortness of breath
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old male presented with a 6-month history of skin thickening extending proximal to the elbows and onto the trunk. HRCT chest confirmed early interstitial lung disease (ILD) with a non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) pattern. He was initiated on mycophenolate mofetil and referred for specialist respiratory physiotherapy.

systemic_sclerosis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC)
  presenting_complaint: Acute headache, blurred vision, and oliguria
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female with known dcSSc and RNA polymerase III antibodies presented acutely with a blood pressure of 210/115 mmHg and rising creatinine. She was admitted to the HDU for urgent blood pressure control with ACE inhibitors (ramipril). Despite initial AKI stage 3, her renal function partially recovered after two weeks of intensive management.

systemic_sclerosis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Systemic sclerosis-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (SSc-PAH)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive exertional dyspnoea and peripheral oedema
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with a 20-year history of lcSSc (CREST syndrome) reported worsening exercise tolerance over 12 months. Transthoracic echocardiogram suggested high pulmonary pressures, and right heart catheterisation confirmed PAH (mPAP 35 mmHg). She was commenced on dual oral therapy with bosentan and sildenafil with symptomatic improvement.

systemic_sclerosis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Juvenile systemic sclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Joint contractures and skin hardening in a child
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old girl presented with restricted movement in her hands and knees. Examination showed diffuse skin thickening and positive anti-Scl-70 antibodies. This rare paediatric presentation was managed with methotrexate and intensive occupational therapy to maintain joint range of motion.

systemic_sclerosis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) in SSc
  presenting_complaint: Chronic fatigue and iron deficiency anaemia
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male with long-standing SSc presented with symptomatic anaemia (Hb 72 g/L). OGD revealed characteristic "watermelon stomach" appearances consistent with GAVE. He underwent multiple sessions of argon plasma coagulation (APC) and required iron sucrose infusions to maintain haemoglobin levels.

systemic_sclerosis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Digital ischaemia and gangrene
  presenting_complaint: Excruciating pain and blackening of the right index finger tip
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female with lcSSc presented with acute-on-chronic digital ischaemia. Despite oral vasodilators, the right second digit progressed to dry gangrene. She was admitted for a 5-day course of intravenous iloprost and required surgical debridement of the necrotic tissue.

systemic_sclerosis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: SSc-Polymyositis overlap syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Proximal muscle weakness and dysphagia
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with cutaneous features of SSc developed progressive difficulty climbing stairs and swallowing solids. Investigations showed an elevated creatine kinase (CK 2500 U/L) and electromyography confirmed a primary myopathic process. Serology was positive for anti-PM/Scl antibodies, and she responded well to a combination of prednisolone and azathioprine.

systemic_sclerosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent dry cough and oxygen desaturation on exertion
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male with dcSSc showed rapid decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) on serial spirometry. HRCT demonstrated extensive traction bronchiectasis and honeycombing involving >30% of lung volume. After failing mycophenolate, he was started on nintedanib and referred for lung transplant assessment.

systemic_sclerosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent reflux and unexplained pulmonary fibrosis
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female presented with severe GORD and ILD but notably lacked any detectable skin thickening. High-titre anti-Scl-70 antibodies and abnormal nailfold capillaries supported the diagnosis of SSc sine scleroderma. She is managed with high-dose proton pump inhibitors and immunosuppression for her pulmonary involvement.

systemic_sclerosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Calcinosis cutis
  presenting_complaint: Painful, chalky discharge from lumps on the elbows
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female with lcSSc presented with multiple subcutaneous nodules over pressure points. Several nodules had ulcerated, leaking a white, calcium-rich paste, leading to secondary cellulitis. Management involved prolonged antibiotics, diltiazem for calcinosis, and surgical excision of the most debilitating lesions.

systemic_sclerosis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: SSc-associated cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations and episodes of syncope
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male with dcSSc underwent cardiac MRI which revealed patchy mid-wall myocardial fibrosis. 24-hour Holter monitoring detected non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. He was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and started on beta-blockers to manage the arrhythmic risk.

systemic_sclerosis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Paraneoplastic systemic sclerosis-like syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset skin tightening and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female presented with rapid skin thickening and positive RNA polymerase III antibodies. Given the temporal relationship and age, an underlying malignancy was suspected; CT imaging identified an early-stage breast adenocarcinoma. Following tumour resection, her skin symptoms significantly improved, suggesting a paraneoplastic phenomenon.

systemic_sclerosis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe gastrointestinal dysmotility
  presenting_complaint: Severe bloating, diarrhoea, and malnutrition
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female with SSc developed pseudo-obstruction and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). She suffered from significant weight loss and malabsorption despite rotating antibiotics and prokinetics. She eventually required total parenteral nutrition (TPN) via a Hickman line for long-term nutritional support.

systemic_sclerosis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: SSc with secondary Sjögren’s syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Severe dry eyes and dry mouth (sicca symptoms)
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female with established lcSSc developed progressive keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia. Schirmer’s test was positive, and biopsy of the minor salivary glands confirmed lymphocytic sialadenitis. She was managed with topical ciclosporin drops and pilocarpine to stimulate saliva production.

systemic_sclerosis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Silica-associated systemic sclerosis (Erasmus syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath and skin hardening in a stonemason
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with 30 years of occupational silica exposure presented with dcSSc and silicosis. The combination, known as Erasmus syndrome, resulted in a particularly aggressive pulmonary course. He was treated with cyclophosphamide infusions but had a poor prognosis due to the underlying silicotic nodules.

systemic_sclerosis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) SSc
  presenting_complaint: Monitoring following stem cell transplantation
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female with rapidly progressive dcSSc and early internal organ involvement underwent HSCT after failing conventional therapy. At 12 months post-transplant, her modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS) had decreased from 28 to 12. She continues on close surveillance for late transplant complications and disease relapse.

systemic_sclerosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Systemic sclerosis in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Routine obstetric review in a patient with lcSSc
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant female (24 weeks gestation) with lcSSc was monitored closely by a multidisciplinary team. The primary concern was the risk of Scleroderma Renal Crisis, so home blood pressure monitoring was mandated. She delivered a healthy infant at 37 weeks via elective C-section without significant maternal complications.

systemic_sclerosis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: SSc-associated trigeminal neuralgia
  presenting_complaint: Sharp, stabbing facial pain
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old female with lcSSc presented with paroxysmal pain in the V2 distribution of the trigeminal nerve. Neurological imaging was unremarkable, and the symptom was attributed to SSc-related connective tissue changes affecting the nerve. The pain was successfully managed with carbamazepine.

systemic_sclerosis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Late-onset limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Mild Raynaud's and stable telangiectasia in an elderly patient
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female was referred after developing mild Raynaud's phenomenon for the first time. Examination showed a few telangiectasias on the palms and a positive anti-centromere antibody. Given her age and the very indolent nature of her disease, she is managed conservatively with lifestyle measures for Raynaud's.
