  presenting_complaint: Painless supraclavicular lump and drenching night sweats
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male presented with a firm, non-tender 3cm left supraclavicular lymph node that had gradually increased in size over two months. CT imaging revealed bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and an excisional biopsy confirmed Reed-Sternberg cells. He commenced ABVD chemotherapy with a good initial metabolic response on PET-CT.

  primary_diagnosis: Metastatic breast carcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Hard lump in the right armpit
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female presented with a solitary, fixed, 2.5cm right axillary lymph node. Mammography and subsequent ultrasound-guided core biopsy identified a primary invasive ductal carcinoma in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. She underwent a mastectomy and axillary node clearance, which confirmed macrometastases in four out of twelve nodes.

lymphadenopathy_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Cat scratch disease (Bartonellosis)
  presenting_complaint: Painful swelling in the elbow and armpit
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old girl presented with subacute epitrochlear and axillary lymphadenopathy ten days after a kitten scratch to her forearm. The nodes were erythematous and exquisitely tender; Bartonella henselae serology was positive. She was treated with a course of azithromycin, resulting in gradual resolution of the lymphadenitis.

  presenting_complaint: Fever, rash, and generalised swollen glands
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male presented with an acute febrile illness, a maculopapular rash, and generalised lymphadenopathy involving cervical, axillary, and inguinal chains. Initial HIV antibody testing was negative, but HIV viral load was extremely high (>1 million copies/ml). He was counselled and commenced on antiretroviral therapy (ART) immediately.

lymphadenopathy_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Sarcoidosis
  presenting_complaint: Dry cough and incidental findings on chest X-ray
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female of Afro-Caribbean descent was investigated for a persistent dry cough and erythema nodosum. Chest radiography revealed bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and serum ACE levels were significantly elevated. Transbronchial needle aspiration confirmed non-caseating granulomas, and she was managed with oral corticosteroids for symptomatic pulmonary sarcoidosis.

lymphadenopathy_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)
  presenting_complaint: Joint pains, facial rash, and swollen glands
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old female presented with chronic generalised lymphadenopathy associated with polyarthritis and a malar rash. Investigations revealed leucopenia, proteinuria, and highly positive ANA and anti-dsDNA titres. The lymphadenopathy was attributed to active SLE and improved significantly following the initiation of hydroxychloroquine and prednisolone.

lymphadenopathy_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Kawasaki disease
  presenting_complaint: High fever, red eyes, and a large neck lump
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old boy presented with a five-day history of high fever (39.5°C) and a unilateral 2cm cervical lymph node. He subsequently developed "strawberry tongue", cracked lips, and truncal rash. He was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and high-dose aspirin to prevent coronary artery aneurysm formation.

lymphadenopathy_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
  presenting_complaint: Hard, painless lump in the upper neck
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male smoker presented with a six-week history of a hard, fixed 4cm Level II cervical lymph node. Flexible nasendoscopy revealed an ulcerated lesion at the base of the tongue. Biopsy confirmed p16-positive SCC, and he was referred for radical chemoradiotherapy for oropharyngeal cancer.

lymphadenopathy_013:

  presenting_complaint: Fever, rash, and widespread lymphadenopathy
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male recently started on phenytoin for epilepsy presented with acute generalised lymphadenopathy, fever, and a diffuse skin eruption. Laboratory tests showed significant eosinophilia and deranged liver function tests (DRESS syndrome). Phenytoin was discontinued, and high-dose systemic steroids were administered, leading to a slow recovery.

lymphadenopathy_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Mesenteric adenitis
  presenting_complaint: Right lower quadrant abdominal pain
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old boy presented with acute abdominal pain mimicking appendicitis following a recent viral upper respiratory infection. Ultrasound revealed multiple enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes (>8mm short axis) in the right iliac fossa with a normal appendix. He was managed conservatively with fluids and analgesia, and symptoms resolved within 48 hours.

lymphadenopathy_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Toxoplasmosis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent swollen glands in the back of the neck
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old female presented with subacute, isolated occipital and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. She reported recent exposure to cat litter and consumption of undercooked meat. Toxoplasma gondii IgM and IgG were positive; as she was not immunocompromised or pregnant, the condition was managed expectantly, and the nodes resolved.

lymphadenopathy_016:

  presenting_complaint: New lump in the groin near an old scar
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with a history of a Clark level IV melanoma excised from his lower leg three years ago presented with a firm inguinal lymph node. PET-CT confirmed isolated nodal recurrence. He underwent an inguinal lymphadenectomy followed by adjuvant immunotherapy with nivolumab.

lymphadenopathy_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Multicentric Castleman disease
  presenting_complaint: Generalised lymphadenopathy, fever, and anaemia
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male presented with chronic generalised lymphadenopathy, significant weight loss, and hepatosplenomegaly. Investigations showed elevated IL-6 levels, anaemia of chronic disease, and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia. Lymph node biopsy showed "lollipop" follicles and interfollicular vascularity, confirming the plasma cell variant of Castleman disease.

lymphadenopathy_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV)
  presenting_complaint: Painful groin swelling with overlying skin redness
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male presented with acute, painful unilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy and a visible "groove sign" created by the inguinal ligament. He had a history of unprotected sexual intercourse and a transient genital ulcer. NAAT testing confirmed Chlamydia trachomatis (L2 serovar), and he was treated with a 21-day course of doxycycline.

lymphadenopathy_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of multiple small neck lumps
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male was found to have multiple, small, "bullet-like" cervical and axillary lymph nodes during a routine check-up. Full blood count revealed an isolated lymphocytosis of 25 x 10^9/L. Flow cytometry confirmed a clonal B-cell population (CD5+, CD19+, CD23+), and he was placed on a "watch and wait" monitoring strategy.

lymphadenopathy_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease
  presenting_complaint: Fever and painful neck lumps unresponsive to antibiotics
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female of East Asian descent presented with subacute, painful cervical lymphadenopathy and prolonged fever.
