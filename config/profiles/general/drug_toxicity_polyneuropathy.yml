  primary_diagnosis: Isoniazid-induced pyridoxine deficiency neuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Burning sensation in the soles of the feet
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male treated for pulmonary tuberculosis with quadruple therapy (RIPE) presented with painful distal paraesthesia after eight weeks. He had not been prescribed pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) supplementation alongside his isoniazid. Upon starting 50mg pyridoxine daily and continuing TB treatment, his neurological symptoms resolved within four weeks.

drug_toxicity_polyneuropathy_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Severe "pins and needles" and numbness in fingers and toes
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer received weekly paclitaxel infusions. By cycle eight, she developed Grade 3 sensory neuropathy affecting her fine motor skills and balance. Treatment was suspended and she was started on duloxetine 60mg for neuropathic pain, which provided moderate symptomatic relief despite persistent numbness.

drug_toxicity_polyneuropathy_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Amiodarone-induced polyneuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Progressive leg weakness and difficulty climbing stairs
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male on long-term amiodarone for refractory atrial fibrillation developed subacute proximal and distal weakness. Examination showed generalized areflexia and a large-fibre sensory loss. Discontinuation of amiodarone led to a slow but steady improvement in mobility over one year, confirmed by improving amplitudes on repeat NCS.

drug_toxicity_polyneuropathy_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Linezolid-induced optic and peripheral neuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Blurred vision and tingling in the extremities
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male treated for MRSA osteomyelitis with linezolid for twelve weeks reported progressive visual blurring and distal paraesthesia. Fundoscopy revealed bilateral optic disc swelling, and NCS showed a length-dependent axonal neuropathy. Linezolid was immediately discontinued, resulting in visual recovery, though the peripheral sensory loss remained permanent.

drug_toxicity_polyneuropathy_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Thalidomide-induced sensory neuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Constant numbness in a "stocking and glove" distribution
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with multiple myeloma was treated with thalidomide-based therapy. He developed a cumulative dose-dependent sensory neuropathy characterized by profound loss of vibration and light touch. Despite stopping the drug, he experienced "coasting," where symptoms continued to worsen for two months before eventually stabilizing.

drug_toxicity_polyneuropathy_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Disulfiram-induced polyneuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive weakness in hands and feet
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with alcohol dependence syndrome started disulfiram 500mg daily. Within three months, she developed significant distal motor weakness and sensory loss. Clinical suspicion of disulfiram toxicity was confirmed by symptom reversal following drug cessation, distinguishing it from alcoholic neuropathy which typically presents more chronically.

drug_toxicity_polyneuropathy_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Phenytoin-induced chronic polyneuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Mild numbness in toes and occasional tripping
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with a 20-year history of phenytoin use for epilepsy presented with mild distal sensory impairment. Serum phenytoin levels were consistently at the high end of the therapeutic range. NCS demonstrated a mild, chronic axonal polyneuropathy likely secondary to long-term exposure; his antiepileptic regimen was switched to levetiracetam to prevent further deterioration.

drug_toxicity_polyneuropathy_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Stavudine-induced toxic neuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Excruciating burning pain in the feet
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male with HIV on a regimen containing stavudine (d4T) presented with subacute, severe distal neuropathic pain and weight loss. Laboratory tests showed elevated serum lactate, suggesting mitochondrial toxicity. The antiretroviral therapy was switched to a tenofovir-based regimen, leading to gradual resolution of the lactic acidosis and pain over several months.

drug_toxicity_polyneuropathy_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Cisplatin-induced sensory neuronopathy
  presenting_complaint: Severe instability when walking and loss of coordination
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female treated for ovarian cancer with high-dose cisplatin developed a profound sensory ataxia. Examination revealed a complete loss of proprioception and vibration sense in the lower limbs, with preserved motor strength. This was diagnosed as a cisplatin-induced dorsal root ganglionopathy (neuronopathy), which unfortunately left her wheelchair-dependent despite stopping the drug.

drug_toxicity_polyneuropathy_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Bortezomib-induced autonomic and peripheral neuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Dizziness upon standing and painful tingling in hands
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male with multiple myeloma received subcutaneous bortezomib. He developed painful small-fibre neuropathy symptoms alongside significant orthostatic hypotension (a drop of 30mmHg systolic). Management included switching to a weekly dosing schedule and introducing fludrocortisone for autonomic support, which allowed for the completion of his oncological treatment.

drug_toxicity_polyneuropathy_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Colchicine-induced myoneuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Severe muscle pain and distal numbness
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with gout and stage 3 CKD was prescribed colchicine 500mcg twice daily. He presented with proximal muscle weakness and distal sensory loss; bloods showed a significantly elevated Creatine Kinase (CK) of 4000 U/L. The combination of renal impairment and colchicine led to toxic accumulation, causing a mixed myoneuropathy that resolved rapidly upon drug withdrawal.

drug_toxicity_polyneuropathy_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Dapsone-induced motor neuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Weakness in the hands and wasting of thumb muscles
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female treated for dermatitis herpetiformis with dapsone presented with progressive bilateral hand weakness. Examination showed wasting of the thenar eminences and weakness of finger extension, with minimal sensory involvement. NCS confirmed a predominantly motor axonal neuropathy; stopping dapsone halted the progression, though muscle bulk took over a year to recover.

drug_toxicity_polyneuropathy_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Loss of balance and "numb" feeling all over the body
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female had been self-medicating with high-dose Vitamin B6 supplements (500mg/day) for "hormonal balance" for three years. She developed a non-length-dependent sensory neuronopathy with severe proprioceptive loss. Investigations ruled out other causes, and her serum B6 levels were five times the upper limit of normal; recovery was slow and incomplete after stopping the supplements.

drug_toxicity_polyneuropathy_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Docetaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Numbness in feet and difficulty with buttons
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male with castrate-resistant prostate cancer received docetaxel chemotherapy. He developed a moderate (Grade 2) sensory-motor neuropathy after six cycles, impacting his activities of daily living. Dose delay and subsequent 20% dose reduction allowed him to continue treatment while preventing progression to life-threatening functional impairment.

drug_toxicity_polyneuropathy_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Leflunomide-induced polyneuropathy
  presenting_complaint: New onset tingling and numbness in both feet
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female with rheumatoid arthritis started leflunomide six months prior. She reported a subacute onset of distal paraesthesia that interfered with sleep. NCS confirmed an axonal sensory neuropathy; leflunomide was discontinued and a cholestyramine washout was performed to accelerate drug clearance, resulting in symptom stabilization within weeks.

drug_toxicity_polyneuropathy_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Suramin-induced acute inflammatory-like polyneuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly ascending paralysis and respiratory distress
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male participating in a clinical trial for suramin developed acute, symmetrical ascending weakness mimicking Guillain-Barré Syndrome. He required ICU admission and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory muscle involvement. High-dose corticosteroids and drug cessation led to a gradual recovery, identifying this as a rare but severe acute toxic neurotoxicity.
