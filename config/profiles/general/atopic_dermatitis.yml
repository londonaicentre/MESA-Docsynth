Managed successfully in the community with liberal use of white soft paraffin and short-term 1% hydrocortisone ointment.

atopic_dermatitis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Impetiginised atopic dermatitis
  presenting_complaint: Worsening itch with honey-coloured crusting and oozing.
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old girl with known flexural eczema presented with an acute flare characterised by golden crusting and painful erosions in the popliteal fossae. Swabs confirmed Staphylococcus aureus infection. Treatment involved a one-week course of oral flucloxacillin, potassium permanganate soaks, and topical fusidic acid combined with betamethasone valerate.

atopic_dermatitis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe refractory atopic dermatitis
  presenting_complaint: Generalised pruritus and sleep disturbance despite potent topicals.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy with a history of severe AD failed to respond to topical mometasone and narrow-band UVB phototherapy. Clinical examination showed extensive lichenification and excoriations covering 40% of body surface area. He was successfully transitioned to subcutaneous Dupilumab after failing a trial of oral Ciclosporin due to hypertension.

atopic_dermatitis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Eczema herpeticum
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly spreading painful blisters and high fever.
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old male with chronic AD presented to A&E with a 2-day history of "punched-out" erosions and vesicles on the face and neck. He was febrile (38.9C) with submandibular lymphadenopathy. Admitted for intravenous Aciclovir and ophthalmology review to rule out dendritic corneal ulcers; he made a full recovery.

atopic_dermatitis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Occupational irritant-aggravated atopic dermatitis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic fissuring and erythema of the hands and wrists.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female nurse with a childhood history of eczema reported severe hand flares since starting ward work. Patch testing was negative for common allergens, suggesting irritant contact dermatitis on a background of atopic diathesis. Managed with Alitretinoin 30mg daily and strict use of soap substitutes and cotton glove liners.

atopic_dermatitis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Erythrodermic atopic dermatitis
  presenting_complaint: Universal skin redness, shivering, and severe skin pain.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male presented with erythroderma involving >90% body surface area and peripheral oedema. Laboratory tests showed significant eosinophilia and elevated IgE (15,000 kU/L). He required inpatient management with supportive fluid resuscitation, temperature regulation, and systemic Methotrexate to stabilise the inflammatory state.

atopic_dermatitis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Head and neck variant atopic dermatitis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent red, scaly rash on the face, eyelids, and neck.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female presented with flares predominantly affecting the "V" of the neck and forehead, poorly responsive to standard steroids. Clinical suspicion of Malassezia sensitivity led to a trial of topical Ketoconazole alongside pimecrolimus cream. This combination resulted in significant clearance where previous monotherapy had failed.

atopic_dermatitis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate atopic dermatitis with comorbid atopic march
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent itchy skin flares associated with seasonal hay fever.
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old male with known asthma and allergic rhinitis presented with subacute flexural eczema. Skin prick testing was positive for house dust mite and grass pollen. Management focused on environmental triggers, daily cetirizine, and proactive "weekend therapy" with topical fluticasone propionate to prevent relapses.

atopic_dermatitis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic lichenified atopic dermatitis
  presenting_complaint: Thickened, leathery patches of skin on ankles and wrists.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with long-standing AD presented with hyperkeratotic, lichenified plaques caused by chronic scratching. He reported significant anxiety and "itch-scratch" cycles. Treatment included potent topical steroids under occlusion (wet wraps) and a referral for habit-reversal habituation therapy.

atopic_dermatitis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Netherton syndrome (Atopic Dermatitis mimic)
  presenting_complaint: Generalised scaling and failure to thrive since birth.
  summary_of_course: A 5-month-old infant was referred for "severe eczema" that failed to respond to standard care. Examination revealed ichthyosis linearis circumflexa and "bamboo hair" (trichorrhexis invaginata) on light microscopy. Genetic testing confirmed a SPINK5 mutation, redirecting management toward specialized emollients and monitoring for metabolic complications.

atopic_dermatitis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Atopic dermatitis with ocular complications
  presenting_complaint: Itchy eyelids and blurred vision.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female with severe facial AD presented with persistent blepharitis and keratoconus. Slit-lamp examination revealed vernal keratoconjunctivitis and early cataract formation likely secondary to long-term periocular steroid use. Management was coordinated with ophthalmology, switching to topical Ciclosporin drops and Tacrolimus 0.03% ointment for the eyelids.

atopic_dermatitis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe atopic dermatitis treated with JAK inhibitors
  presenting_complaint: Intense, unrelenting pruritus and extensive skin involvement.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male failed multiple systemic agents including Azathioprine and Ciclosporin. He was commenced on Abrocitinib 200mg daily following normal baseline haematology and shingles vaccination. He achieved a 75% reduction in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score within four weeks with no adverse events.

atopic_dermatitis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute atopic dermatitis in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Worsening eczema flare during the second trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant woman experienced a significant flare of her pre-existing AD. Management was restricted to avoid systemic immunosuppressants; she was treated with moderate-potency topical steroids and narrow-band UVB phototherapy, which is considered safe in pregnancy. The condition improved, and she delivered a healthy neonate at term.

atopic_dermatitis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild atopic dermatitis (Community-managed)
  presenting_complaint: Occasional itchy patches in the elbow creases.
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old girl presented to her GP with mild, intermittent erythema in the antecubital fossae. The patient was educated on the "soak and smear" technique and the importance of avoiding fragranced soaps. Her symptoms were well-controlled with occasional use of Eumovate cream and daily Epaderm ointment.

atopic_dermatitis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening erythrodermic AD with septicaemia
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, rigors, and total body skin exfoliation.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with neglected severe AD was admitted to the ICU with hypothermia and hypotension. Blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus, and he was diagnosed with septicaemia secondary to skin barrier failure. Treatment required aggressive IV antibiotics, thermoregulation, and nutritional support alongside intensive topical therapy.

atopic_dermatitis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Nummular (discoid) atopic dermatitis
  presenting_complaint: Coin-shaped itchy red discs on the lower legs.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male presented with well-demarcated circular erythematous plaques, initially misdiagnosed as tinea corporis. Skin scrapings were negative for fungal elements, and the distribution was consistent with a discoid variant of AD. He responded well to potent topical steroids (Betnovate) and soap substitutes.

atopic_dermatitis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Atopic dermatitis with dermatopathic lymphadenopathy
  presenting_complaint: Large, painless lumps in the groin and armpits during a flare.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy with severe generalised AD presented with prominent axillary and inguinal lymph nodes. An ultrasound-guided biopsy was performed to rule out lymphoma, showing reactive hyperplasia consistent with dermatopathic lymphadenopathy. The nodes regressed significantly once his skin inflammation was controlled with oral Prednisolone.

atopic_dermatitis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Atopic dermatitis with secondary allergic contact dermatitis
  presenting_complaint: Flare of eczema specifically under a watch strap and belt buckle.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male with a background of mild AD developed acute vesicular lesions on his wrists. Patch testing revealed a strong positive reaction to Nickel sulfate. His management plan was updated to include allergen avoidance and the use of dermovate for acute contact flares.

atopic_dermatitis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate atopic dermatitis with psychosocial impact
  presenting_complaint: Low mood and school refusal due to skin appearance.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old girl with visible eczema on her hands and face reported being bullied and feeling depressed. Her EASI score indicated moderate disease, but the impact on her Quality of Life (DLQI) was disproportionately high. Management included a combination of topical Tacrolimus and a referral to paediatric psychology for support.

atopic_dermatitis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Infantile atopic dermatitis with food allergy
  presenting_complaint: Immediate facial swelling and eczema flare after eating egg.
  summary_of_course: A 9-month-old male infant with moderate AD experienced an acute urticarial reaction upon his first exposure to scrambled eggs. IgE testing confirmed a Type 1 hypersensitivity to egg white. Management involved strict dietary avoidance, an adrenaline auto-injector prescription, and optimized topical management for his underlying dermatitis.
