  presenting_complaint: Severe generalised bone pain, primarily affecting the femurs and lower back.
  summary_of_course: an 8-year-old girl with HbSS disease was admitted with an acute pain crisis triggered by a viral infection. She required aggressive hydration and a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump with morphine to manage the pain. Her symptoms resolved over five days with supportive care and incentive spirometry to prevent acute chest syndrome.

  presenting_complaint: Sharp, electric shock-like facial pain triggered by brushing teeth or light touch.
  summary_of_course: A 71-year-old female presented with recurrent, brief episodes of lancinating pain in the right V2 distribution. Initial management with carbamazepine provided partial relief but caused significant ataxia. She was referred to neurosurgery for consideration of microvascular decompression after failing secondary medical management with lamotrigine.

severe_pain_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (Type 1)
  presenting_complaint: Continuous burning pain in the right hand, disproportionate to the original injury, with associated swelling.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female developed severe, persistent pain six weeks following a Colles' fracture. Examination revealed allodynia, hyperalgesia, and vasomotor instability in the affected limb. She was managed through a multidisciplinary pain clinic involving physiotherapy, desensitisation techniques, and gabapentin.

  presenting_complaint: Widespread musculoskeletal pain, chronic fatigue, and "brain fog" for over twelve months.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old female reported moderate-to-severe pain across multiple body regions with no evidence of inflammatory arthropathy. Extensive blood tests, including ESR and RF, were normal. Management focused on a biopsychosocial approach, including aerobic exercise, sleep hygiene, and low-dose amitriptyline.

severe_pain_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Mesenteric Ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Severe central abdominal pain "out of proportion" to clinical findings on palpation.
  summary_of_course: An 83-year-old female with atrial fibrillation presented with sudden, generalised abdominal agony and metabolic acidosis (lactate 6.2 mmol/L). An urgent CT angiogram showed an occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery. Given her frailty and extensive bowel necrosis found at laparotomy, a palliative approach was agreed upon with the family.

severe_pain_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-herpetic Neuralgia
  presenting_complaint: Persistent burning and stabbing pain in the T4 dermatome following a shingles rash three months ago.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male presented with severe cutaneous sensitivity where the previous vesicles had healed. The pain significantly interfered with his sleep and daily activities. He was treated with lidocaine 5% medicated plasters and a titrated dose of pregabalin, which achieved a 50% reduction in pain scores.

severe_pain_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Limb Ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of a cold, pale, and intensely painful right lower leg.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male smoker presented with the "6 Ps" of limb ischaemia. Examination revealed an absent popliteal and pedal pulse. He underwent emergency femoral embolectomy and fasciotomies to treat compartment syndrome, followed by long-term anticoagulation.

severe_pain_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Cluster Headache
  presenting_complaint: Unilateral, excruciating retro-orbital pain occurring daily at the same time, associated with eye watering.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male presented with "suicide headaches" lasting 45 minutes, occurring three times daily for the past fortnight. He responded well to 100% high-flow oxygen via a non-rebreather mask and subcutaneous sumatriptan. Verapamil was initiated for prophylaxis during the cluster period.

severe_pain_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Endometriosis
  presenting_complaint: Severe dysmenorrhoea and chronic pelvic pain, often resulting in absence from work.
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old female had a five-year history of worsening cyclical pain and dyspareunia. Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed Stage III endometriosis with significant adhesions and "powder-burn" lesions. She was managed with laparoscopic ablation and a GnRH agonist to suppress the menstrual cycle.

severe_pain_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Phantom Limb Pain
  presenting_complaint: Shooting, cramping sensations perceived in a limb that was amputated six months ago.
  summary_of_course: A 56-year-old male, post-above-knee amputation for diabetic gangrene, reported severe pain in the "ghost" foot. Traditional analgesics were ineffective. He was enrolled in a mirror therapy programme and started on duloxetine, which gradually reduced the frequency and intensity of the phantom sensations.

severe_pain_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Testicular Torsion
  presenting_complaint: Acute, severe left scrotal pain and swelling, accompanied by lower abdominal pain and nausea.
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old boy presented with a four-hour history of sudden testicular pain. Physical exam showed a high-riding testis with a horizontal lie and an absent cremasteric reflex. He was taken immediately to theatre for bilateral orchidopexy; the left testis was salvaged despite 360-degree torsion.

severe_pain_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Metastatic Spinal Cord Compression (MSCC)
  presenting_complaint: New-onset, severe band-like thoracic pain and bilateral leg heaviness.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old female with a history of breast cancer presented with "red flag" spinal symptoms. MRI of the whole spine demonstrated a collapse at T8 with posterior element involvement. She was started on high-dose dexamethasone (16mg) and underwent urgent posterior decompression and stabilisation.

severe_pain_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Gouty Arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Rapid onset of extreme pain, redness, and swelling in the first metatarsophalangeal joint.
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male with hypertension and chronic kidney disease (Stage 3) presented with a hot, exquisitely tender big toe. Joint aspiration confirmed negatively birefringent needle-shaped crystals. Due to his renal impairment, NSAIDs were avoided; he was treated with a short course of oral prednisolone and subsequent allopurinol.

severe_pain_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia
  presenting_complaint: Paradoxical worsening of generalised pain despite escalating doses of oxycodone.
  summary_of_course: A 49-year-old female with chronic low back pain had been titrated up to 120mg of oxycodone daily by her GP. She reported that her pain was more diffuse and intense than ever before. Under specialist supervision, she underwent a successful opioid rotation to buprenorphine patches and a gradual dose reduction, resulting in improved functional status.

severe_pain_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Cauda Equina Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Severe lower back pain associated with saddle anaesthesia and recent urinary incontinence.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male presented with acute disc prolapse symptoms. Examination revealed reduced anal tone and numbness in the perineal region. An emergency MRI confirmed a massive central disc sequestration at L4/L5, and he underwent a microdiscectomy within 6 hours of presentation to prevent permanent neurological deficit.

severe_pain_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)
  presenting_complaint: Heavy, crushing central chest pain radiating to the left arm and jaw, associated with diaphoresis.
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old male presented to the paramedics with "elephant on the chest" pain. The 12-lead ECG showed ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V4. He was transferred directly to the primary PCI centre, where a total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery was stented, leading to immediate pain resolution.
