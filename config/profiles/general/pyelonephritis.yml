  presenting_complaint: Swinging pyrexia and a persistent loin lump.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male smoker with a history of intravenous drug use was treated for acute pyelonephritis but remained febrile after 5 days of appropriate IV antibiotics. Repeat CT imaging identified a 5cm fluid collection in the perinephric space. He underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage, which grew Staphylococcus aureus, and required a 4-week course of targeted antibiotics.

pyelonephritis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute pyelonephritis with septic shock
  presenting_complaint: Hypotension, tachycardia, and obtundation.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female was brought to the ICU by ambulance with a blood pressure of 80/40mmHg and a temperature of 39.8°C. She required noradrenaline support and invasive ventilation for multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) secondary to Klebsiella pyelonephritis. After a 14-day stay involving renal replacement therapy for AKI, she was successfully stepped down to the renal ward.

  primary_diagnosis: Acute pyelonephritis mimicking acute abdomen
  presenting_complaint: Severe right iliac fossa pain and guarding.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male presented with symptoms highly suggestive of acute appendicitis. Surgical review noted atypical radiation of pain to the back and a positive urine dipstick for nitrites and leucocytes. CT abdomen/pelvis ruled out appendicitis but showed focal enhancement and swelling of the right lower pole of the kidney, confirming pyelonephritis.

pyelonephritis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Pyelonephritis in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD)
  presenting_complaint: Fever and localized pain over a palpable renal cyst.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with ADPKD presented with a localized "cyst-like" pain and systemic infection. Distinguishing between an infected cyst and parenchymal pyelonephritis was challenging; however, MRI showed restricted diffusion in the renal parenchyma. He was treated with prolonged lipophilic antibiotics (ciprofloxacin) known to penetrate cysts effectively.
