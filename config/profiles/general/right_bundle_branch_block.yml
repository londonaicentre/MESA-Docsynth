  primary_diagnosis: Post-surgical right bundle branch block
  presenting_complaint: Routine paediatric cardiology follow-up
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old male with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair in infancy attended his annual review. ECG shows a persistent, stable RBBB with a QRS duration of 140ms, which is a common sequela of the ventriculotomy used during his initial repair. He remains asymptomatic with good exercise tolerance. Annual monitoring continues to screen for potential progression to bifascicular block or ventricular arrhythmias.

right_bundle_branch_block_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with cor pulmonale
  presenting_complaint: Worsening peripheral oedema and exertional breathlessness
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old heavy smoker with known COPD presented with bilateral pitting leg oedema and increased sputum production. ECG revealed RBBB, right axis deviation, and peaked P waves in lead II, suggesting right heart strain. Echocardiography confirmed right ventricular hypertrophy and dilatation with significant pulmonary hypertension. Management focused on optimising bronchodilators, long-term oxygen therapy, and cautious diuretic use.

right_bundle_branch_block_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute anterior myocardial infarction with new RBBB
  presenting_complaint: Severe retrosternal chest pain and diaphoresis
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented with 2 hours of crushing chest pain. The initial ECG showed ST-elevation in leads V1-V4 and a new-onset RBBB, indicating a proximal LAD occlusion and high-risk status. He underwent emergency primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with a drug-eluting stent. Despite successful reperfusion, the RBBB persisted, and he required temporary pacing for transient high-grade AV block during the ICU stay.

right_bundle_branch_block_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Brugada Syndrome (Type 1)
  presenting_complaint: Unexplained nocturnal syncope
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male of Southeast Asian descent was brought to A&E after a syncopal episode while sleeping. The ECG showed a "coved" ST-segment elevation >2mm followed by a negative T-wave in V1-V2, mimicking a right bundle branch block pattern. Provocative testing with ajmaline confirmed the diagnosis of Brugada Syndrome. He was subsequently fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death.

right_bundle_branch_block_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Secundum atrial septal defect (ASD)
  presenting_complaint: Reduced exercise tolerance and palpitations
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female presented with progressive fatigue during gym sessions. Physical examination revealed a fixed split second heart sound and a systolic flow murmur. ECG showed an incomplete RBBB pattern with a QRS of 114ms and right axis deviation. Transoesophageal echocardiography confirmed a large secundum ASD with significant left-to-right shunting. She underwent successful percutaneous closure of the defect.

right_bundle_branch_block_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent palpitations and lightheadedness
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male athlete presented with palpitations triggered by running. ECG showed RBBB and T-wave inversion in V1-V3, with a characteristic epsilon wave visible at the end of the QRS complex. Cardiac MRI demonstrated fibrofatty replacement of the right ventricular myocardium and regional wall motion abnormalities. He was advised to cease competitive sports and commenced on beta-blocker therapy.

right_bundle_branch_block_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-TAVI conduction disturbance
  presenting_complaint: New-onset RBBB following aortic valve replacement
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female underwent a transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Post-procedural ECG showed a new RBBB and first-degree AV block (bifascicular block). Given the high risk of progression to complete heart block, she was monitored via telemetry for 72 hours. As the conduction delay remained stable and she remained asymptomatic, she was discharged with a 14-day Holter monitor for safety.

right_bundle_branch_block_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Lenegre-Lev disease
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent dizzy spells and near-syncope
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old male with no significant history presented with intermittent presyncope. Serial ECGs over three years showed progressive conduction disease, starting with RBBB and later developing left anterior fascicular block (LAFB). A 24-hour tape captured episodes of paroxysmal complete heart block. He was diagnosed with Lenegre-Lev disease (idiopathic fibrosis of the conduction system) and received a permanent dual-chamber pacemaker.

right_bundle_branch_block_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute viral myocarditis
  presenting_complaint: Flu-like illness followed by sharp chest pain
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male presented with pleuritic chest pain one week after a viral upper respiratory tract infection. ECG showed RBBB and diffuse ST-segment elevation. Troponin T was significantly elevated at 450 ng/L. Cardiac MRI confirmed subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement consistent with myocarditis. He was treated with ibuprofen and colchicine, and the RBBB resolved completely as the myocardial inflammation subsided over the following month.

right_bundle_branch_block_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe hyperkalaemia (Pseudo-RBBB)
  presenting_complaint: Profound weakness and oliguria
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with end-stage renal disease missed two dialysis sessions. He presented with generalized muscle weakness and an ECG showing a very wide QRS (>160ms) with an RBBB-like morphology and "tented" T waves. Serum potassium was 7.4 mmol/L. He received urgent calcium gluconate, insulin-dextrose, and emergency haemodialysis. Post-dialysis ECG showed complete resolution of the QRS widening and restoration of his baseline sinus rhythm.

right_bundle_branch_block_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Cardiac contusion following blunt chest trauma
  presenting_complaint: Chest wall pain and bruising after road traffic accident
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male was involved in a high-speed collision with steering wheel impact to the chest. Initial ECG in the trauma bay showed a new RBBB. Troponin I was elevated at 1.2 ng/mL. He was admitted for 24-hour cardiac monitoring due to the risk of arrhythmias. The RBBB persisted for 48 hours before resolving spontaneously, and serial echocardiograms showed no structural damage or pericardial effusion.

right_bundle_branch_block_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (Group 1)
  presenting_complaint: Severe dyspnoea and syncope on exertion
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with systemic sclerosis presented with worsening functional capacity (WHO Class III). ECG demonstrated RBBB and right ventricular strain. Right heart catheterisation confirmed a mean pulmonary artery pressure of 45 mmHg with a normal wedge pressure. She was commenced on dual oral therapy with bosentan and sildenafil, which improved her haemodynamics, though the RBBB remained a chronic feature of her ECG.

right_bundle_branch_block_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Physiological incomplete RBBB in an athlete
  presenting_complaint: Pre-participation screening for elite rowing
  summary_of_course: A 20-year-old asymptomatic male rower underwent screening. ECG showed an incomplete RBBB pattern (QRS 108ms) and voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy. Given his high level of training, these were interpreted as normal physiological adaptations of the "athlete's heart." An echocardiogram confirmed normal cardiac structure and function with no evidence of ASD or cardiomyopathy. He was cleared for competitive sports.

right_bundle_branch_block_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe tricuspid regurgitation with right heart failure
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal bloating and leg swelling
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female with a history of permanent atrial fibrillation presented with signs of right heart failure. ECG showed AF with a rapid ventricular response and a co-existing RBBB. Echocardiography revealed severe functional tricuspid regurgitation due to massive annular dilatation. She was managed with high-dose loop diuretics and rate control, but the RBBB persisted, reflecting chronic right ventricular remodelling.

right_bundle_branch_block_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Cardiac sarcoidosis
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations and dry cough
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male with known pulmonary sarcoidosis presented with new-onset palpitations. ECG revealed RBBB and frequent ventricular ectopics. A PET-CT scan showed increased FDG uptake in the basal septum, and cardiac MRI confirmed patchy late gadolinium enhancement. He was started on high-dose prednisolone and methotrexate, and an ICD was implanted due to the high risk of sudden cardiac death associated with sarcoid-related conduction disease.

right_bundle_branch_block_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Bifascicular block (RBBB and Left Posterior Fascicular Block)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent syncope and bradycardia
  summary_of_course: A 76-year-old male presented after a fall. ECG showed RBBB with a right axis deviation (+150 degrees), consistent with LPFB. This combination of RBBB and LPFB is a high-risk bifascicular block. While in the emergency department, he had a witnessed syncopal episode with telemetry showing transient 3:1 AV block. He was urgently fitted with a permanent dual-chamber pacemaker.

right_bundle_branch_block_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Ebstein's anomaly
  presenting_complaint: Cyanosis and fatigue in a child
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old girl was referred for evaluation of a heart murmur and mild cyanosis. ECG showed a very wide RBBB with "bizarre" fragmented QRS complexes and giant P waves (Himalayan P waves). Echocardiography confirmed Ebstein's anomaly with apical displacement of the tricuspid valve and "atrialisation" of the right ventricle. She was scheduled for a Cone procedure to repair the tricuspid valve.

right_bundle_branch_block_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Massive pulmonary embolism with haemodynamic collapse
  presenting_complaint: Sudden collapse and hypotension
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male, 10 days post-orthopaedic surgery, collapsed in the ward. He was hypotensive (BP 80/40) and hypoxic. ECG showed sinus tachycardia at 130 bpm with a new RBBB and ST-depression in V1-V3. Bedside echo showed a dilated, akinetic right ventricle (McConnell's sign). He received emergency thrombolysis with alteplase in the ICU, resulting in rapid haemodynamic improvement and gradual narrowing of the QRS complex.
