  primary_diagnosis: Open fracture of the humeral shaft (Gustilo-Anderson Grade IIIA)
  presenting_complaint: Bleeding and visible bone in the right upper arm following an industrial machinery accident.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male sustained a crush injury resulting in a heavily contaminated open humeral fracture. He received immediate IV antibiotics and underwent emergency debridement and external fixation. Following soft tissue stabilisation, the external fixator was converted to an internal plate, and the wound healed without signs of osteomyelitis.

fracture_of_shoulder_upper_arm_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Floating shoulder (Ipsilateral clavicle and scapular neck fractures)
  presenting_complaint: Left shoulder girdle pain and instability after a fall from a horse.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female presented with polytrauma including a displaced mid-shaft clavicle fracture and a scapular neck fracture. This "floating shoulder" injury required surgical stabilisation of the clavicle to restore the suspensory mechanism of the shoulder. Post-operative recovery was uneventful with a return to equestrian activities at six months.

fracture_of_shoulder_upper_arm_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Humeral neck fracture with axillary artery injury
  presenting_complaint: Cold, pale right hand and severe shoulder pain following a high-velocity RTA.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male presented with a displaced proximal humerus fracture and absent distal pulses. Emergency angiography confirmed an axillary artery occlusion. He underwent urgent vascular bypass surgery and concurrent internal fixation of the fracture; despite initial ischaemia, limb salvage was successful.

  primary_diagnosis: Neonatal humeral shaft fracture
  presenting_complaint: Lack of movement in the left arm and swelling noted 12 hours after a difficult delivery.
  summary_of_course: A full-term neonate born via vacuum extraction for shoulder dystocia was noted to have pseudoparalysis of the left arm. Radiographs confirmed a mid-shaft humeral fracture. The arm was immobilised against the chest for two weeks, and rapid callus formation was noted, with no long-term growth plate disturbance.

fracture_of_shoulder_upper_arm_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Hardware failure following humeral ORIF
  presenting_complaint: Sudden "snap" and return of pain in the upper arm while reaching for a shelf.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female with rheumatoid arthritis had undergone ORIF for a humeral fracture four months prior. Radiographs showed a broken locking plate at the fracture site, suggestive of delayed union. She was managed with revision surgery using a longer plate and BMP-7 (bone morphogenetic protein) to stimulate healing.

fracture_of_shoulder_upper_arm_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute compartment syndrome of the upper arm
  presenting_complaint: Intense, disproportionate pain and paraesthesia in the right arm following a crush injury.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male was pinned under a heavy vehicle, sustaining a comminuted humeral shaft fracture. Despite splinting, he developed tense swelling and pain on passive finger extension. Emergency fasciotomy was performed alongside humeral nailing, preventing permanent ischaemic contracture.

fracture_of_shoulder_upper_arm_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Spiral stress fracture of the humerus
  presenting_complaint: Sharp, sudden pain in the mid-humerus during a competitive javelin throw.
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old elite athlete had been experiencing prodromal aching in the arm for weeks. During a high-effort throw, he felt a "crack." Radiographs revealed a spiral fracture through the mid-shaft, likely originating from a chronic stress injury. He was treated with a functional brace and a tailored rehabilitation programme.

fracture_of_shoulder_upper_arm_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Comminuted proximal humerus fracture in renal osteodystrophy
  presenting_complaint: Left shoulder pain after a minor slip.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male on long-term haemodialysis for end-stage renal failure sustained a Neer 4-part fracture from a low-energy fall. Due to poor bone quality (renal osteodystrophy), internal fixation was deemed high risk for failure. He underwent a primary reverse shoulder arthroplasty, allowing for early mobilisation and improved pain control.

fracture_of_shoulder_upper_arm_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Bilateral humeral shaft fractures
  presenting_complaint: Multiple injuries including bilateral arm deformity following a fall from height (4 storeys).
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male was admitted to the ICU with a traumatic brain injury and bilateral humeral fractures. Once stabilised, he underwent bilateral retrograde intramedullary nailing. This allowed for easier nursing care and early weight-bearing through the arms to assist with future mobilisation.

fracture_of_shoulder_upper_arm_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Neglected proximal humerus fracture with dementia
  presenting_complaint: Extensive bruising of the chest wall and upper arm noted by care home staff.
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old male with advanced dementia was found on the floor but could not provide a history. Three days later, significant ecchymosis was noted. Imaging showed a displaced 2-part surgical neck fracture. Treatment was focused on comfort and analgesia, as he was not a candidate for surgery or intensive physiotherapy.

fracture_of_shoulder_upper_arm_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Displaced greater tuberosity fracture
  presenting_complaint: Inability to abduct the right arm after falling onto the shoulder.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female presented with what appeared to be a rotator cuff tear. However, radiographs and subsequent CT showed a 1cm displaced fracture of the greater tuberosity. To prevent impingement and restore cuff function, she underwent arthroscopic-assisted suture anchor fixation.

fracture_of_shoulder_upper_arm_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Malunion of humeral shaft fracture
  presenting_complaint: Significant bowing of the upper arm and limited elbow flexion.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male had a humeral fracture treated in a plaster cast abroad 10 years ago. He presented with a 25-degree varus malunion that caused aesthetic concern and functional limitation. He underwent a corrective closing-wedge osteotomy and plating, which successfully restored the mechanical axis of the humerus.

fracture_of_shoulder_upper_arm_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Avascular necrosis (AVN) of the humeral head following fracture
  presenting_complaint: Progressive, deep-seated shoulder pain and stiffness one year after a proximal humerus fracture.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female had previously been treated for a 4-part proximal humerus fracture. Despite initial healing, she developed worsening pain. MRI confirmed stage IV avascular necrosis of the humeral head with collapse. She was successfully treated with a total shoulder replacement, resulting in significant pain relief.
