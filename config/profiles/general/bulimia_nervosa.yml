bulimia_nervosa_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Bulimia Nervosa
  presenting_complaint: Sore throat and persistent acid reflux.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female university student presented to her GP with a chronic sore throat and dyspepsia. Physical examination revealed mild dental enamel erosion and bilateral parotid gland enlargement. She admitted to twice-weekly binge eating followed by self-induced vomiting for six months. She was referred for guided self-help based on CBT-ED principles and showed significant improvement at 3-month follow-up.

bulimia_nervosa_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Bulimia Nervosa with Hypokalaemia
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations and generalised muscle weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female was brought to A&E after a near-syncopal episode. Initial investigations revealed a serum potassium of 2.1 mmol/L and U waves on ECG, consistent with severe hypokalaemia. The patient disclosed daily binge-purge cycles (5-10 times per day) and significant laxative misuse. She was admitted for urgent intravenous potassium replacement and psychiatric consultation for intensive inpatient eating disorder management.

bulimia_nervosa_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Bulimia Nervosa with Dental Complications
  presenting_complaint: Referral from dentist regarding severe tooth sensitivity and loss of enamel.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old woman with a 20-year history of fluctuating eating pathology presented with extensive perimylolysis. Despite a BMI of 23.5 kg/m2, she reported secretive purging behaviours that had persisted since her teens. Blood tests showed a compensated metabolic alkalosis (bicarbonate 32 mmol/L). She was started on high-dose fluoxetine and referred to a specialist community eating disorder service for long-term psychotherapy.

bulimia_nervosa_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Bulimia Nervosa in an Adolescent Male
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent fainting during rugby practice.
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old male athlete presented with orthostatic hypotension and bradycardia. Initially suspected to be overtraining, further history revealed episodes of consuming large quantities of food followed by excessive compensatory exercise and self-induced vomiting to "make weight" for sports. He was diagnosed with BN and commenced on a family-based treatment (FBT) protocol adapted for adolescents, focusing on nutritional rehabilitation and reducing exercise compulsions.

bulimia_nervosa_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening Bulimia Nervosa with Boerhaave Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset, excruciating retrosternal chest pain following a binge.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female with a known history of severe BN presented in extremis with surgical emphysema in the neck and signs of septic shock. A CT thorax with oral contrast confirmed an oesophageal perforation (Boerhaave syndrome) following a violent episode of vomiting. She underwent emergency thoracotomy and primary repair, followed by a prolonged ICU stay. Post-stabilisation, she was transitioned to a high-dependency psychiatric unit for weight and behaviour monitoring.

bulimia_nervosa_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Bulimia Nervosa comorbid with Type 1 Diabetes (Diabulimia)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent hospital admissions for Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA).
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female with Type 1 Diabetes presented with a HbA1c of 102 mmol/mol and frequent DKA episodes. Clinical interviews revealed she was intentionally omitting insulin doses to lose weight following binge eating episodes. This complex presentation required a multidisciplinary approach involving endocrinology and specialist eating disorder teams. Treatment focused on "insulin education" and CBT-ED to address the underlying fear of weight gain associated with glycaemic control.

bulimia_nervosa_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Bulimia Nervosa in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Excessive "morning sickness" and poor weight gain at 14 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old pregnant woman was referred by her midwife due to concerns that her vomiting was not typical hyperemesis gravidarum. She eventually disclosed a relapse of BN triggered by the body changes of pregnancy. Bloods showed mild hypokalaemia (3.2 mmol/L) and ketonuria. She received intensive outpatient support from a perinatal mental health team and specialist dietetics to ensure foetal growth and maternal stability.

bulimia_nervosa_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Late-onset Bulimia Nervosa
  presenting_complaint: Unexplained weight fluctuations and chronic constipation.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female presented with new-onset gastrointestinal distress. After excluding malignancy via colonoscopy, a detailed psychological assessment revealed she had developed binge-purge behaviours following retirement and the death of her spouse. This "late-onset" BN was treated with age-modified CBT, focusing on bereavement and life transitions, alongside stool softeners to manage laxative withdrawal.

bulimia_nervosa_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Bulimia Nervosa with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)
  presenting_complaint: Self-harm and impulsive bingeing/purging.
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old male with a history of emotional dysregulation presented to the crisis team. He described binge eating as a method of emotional numbing, followed by purging as self-punishment. His presentation was complicated by frequent non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). He was enrolled in Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) specifically adapted for eating disorders (DBT-ED) to address both the BN symptoms and underlying affective instability.

bulimia_nervosa_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate Bulimia Nervosa with Russell’s Sign
  presenting_complaint: Callouses on the knuckles and swelling of the cheeks.
  summary_of_course: A 20-year-old female student was noted by her GP to have prominent callouses on her right hand (Russell's sign) during a routine vaccination. When questioned, she admitted to daily self-induced vomiting to control her weight. Physical exam confirmed bilateral sialadenosis. She was started on a 20-session course of CBT-ED and provided with dental hygiene advice to minimize acid damage while working toward abstinence from purging.

bulimia_nervosa_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Bulimia Nervosa with Mallory-Weiss Tear
  presenting_complaint: Haematemesis following a binge episode.
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old female presented to A&E with bright red blood in her vomit. Endoscopy revealed a mucosal tear at the gastro-oesophageal junction (Mallory-Weiss tear) caused by forceful vomiting. She was haemodynamically stable and the bleeding stopped spontaneously. She was subsequently referred to the eating disorder service, where her BN was classified as severe due to the frequency of purging and physical complications.

bulimia_nervosa_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Bulimia Nervosa
  presenting_complaint: Persistent symptoms despite multiple courses of therapy.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old woman with a 15-year history of BN had failed two courses of CBT-ED and one course of Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT). She continued to binge and purge daily, with significant impact on her social and occupational functioning. She was transitioned to a more intensive day-patient programme focusing on meal support and supervised post-meal periods, alongside a trial of topiramate as an adjunct to reduce binge frequency.

bulimia_nervosa_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Bulimia Nervosa with Laxative Abuse Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Chronic diarrhoea, abdominal cramping, and oedema.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female presented with peripheral oedema and "lazy bowel" symptoms. She admitted to consuming over 50 stimulant laxatives daily to "flush out" binges. Investigations showed a metabolic acidosis and significant dehydration. Treatment involved a slow, supervised laxative taper to avoid rebound oedema and severe constipation, paired with nutritional rehabilitation.

bulimia_nervosa_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Bulimia Nervosa with Alcohol Use Disorder
  presenting_complaint: Frequent blackouts and vomiting.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old male presented with a dual diagnosis of BN and alcohol dependence. He reported "drunkorexia" tendencies—restricting food and then bingeing/purging while intoxicated. His liver function tests showed elevated GGT and macrocytosis. He required a dual-track treatment plan involving community alcohol detox followed by residential eating disorder treatment to address the interconnected nature of his substance use and BN.

bulimia_nervosa_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Early-onset Bulimia Nervosa (Paediatric)
  presenting_complaint: Parental concern regarding disappearing food and secretiveness.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old girl was brought to the paediatrician after her parents found hidden food wrappers and heard her vomiting in the bathroom. She expressed intense body dissatisfaction and fear of puberty. Clinical assessment confirmed BN with a normal BMI for age. She was treated via the Maudsley Model (FBT-BN), which empowered the parents to supervise all meals and bathroom access, leading to symptom remission within 6 months.

bulimia_nervosa_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Atypical Bulimia Nervosa (Normal Weight)
  presenting_complaint: Low mood and feeling "out of control" with eating.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old female with a BMI of 22.5 kg/m2 (within healthy range) presented with significant psychological distress. Despite her "healthy" appearance, she was bingeing on 5,000+ calories and purging 4 times daily. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge where the severity of the eating disorder is masked by a normal BMI. She was prioritised for specialist CBT-ED due to the high frequency of compensatory behaviours and associated suicide risk.

bulimia_nervosa_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Bulimia Nervosa with Ipecac-induced Cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath on exertion and peripheral oedema.
  summary_of_course: A 23-year-old female with long-standing BN presented with signs of congestive heart failure. History revealed she had been using Ipecac syrup to induce vomiting for several months. Echocardiography showed a reduced ejection fraction of 35% and global hypokinesis. She was admitted to cardiology for heart failure management and urgently transferred to an eating disorder unit for medical stabilisation and cessation of Ipecac use.

bulimia_nervosa_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Bulimia Nervosa (Non-purging subtype/Exercise compensatory)
  presenting_complaint: Stress fractures and amenorrhoea.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female cross-country runner presented with a tibial stress fracture. While she denied vomiting or laxative use, she admitted to 4-hour "punishment" runs after episodes of objective binge eating. Investigations showed low oestradiol and reduced bone mineral density on DEXA scan. She was diagnosed with BN (exercise as primary compensatory mechanism) and required a strict "no-exercise" contract as part of her initial recovery phase.

bulimia_nervosa_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Bulimia Nervosa with Stage 3 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
  presenting_complaint: Routine bloods showing elevated creatinine.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old woman with chronic, severe BN was found to have an eGFR of 45 mL/min/1.73m2. This was attributed to years of chronic dehydration and recurrent hypokalaemia causing interstitial nephritis. Management required close collaboration between nephrology and the eating disorder team to stabilise her fluid status and prevent further renal decline while addressing the underlying purging behaviours.

bulimia_nervosa_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Bulimia Nervosa comorbid with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
  presenting_complaint: Rigid rituals surrounding eating and purging.
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old female presented with BN where her binge-purge cycles were dictated by complex OCD rituals (e.g., eating foods in a specific colour order, purging exactly 15 minutes after the first bite). Her treatment was particularly challenging as the BN was inextricably linked to her OCD symptoms. She was treated with Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) for the OCD alongside CBT-ED for the bulimia.
