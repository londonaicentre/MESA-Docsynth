neurosyphilis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic neurosyphilis
  presenting_complaint: Routine screening following a diagnosis of latent syphilis of unknown duration.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old HIV-positive male underwent a lumbar puncture despite being neurologically intact due to high serum RPR titres (1:128). CSF analysis revealed a lymphocytic pleocytosis (25 cells/μL) and a positive CSF-VDRL, confirming asymptomatic neurosyphilis. He was treated with 14 days of intravenous benzylpenicillin, resulting in a normalised CSF profile at six-month follow-up.

neurosyphilis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute syphilitic meningitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe headache, photophobia, and neck stiffness over three days.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male presented to A&E with meningism and a maculopapular rash on his palms. Lumbar puncture showed elevated opening pressure and a positive Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) assay in the CSF. He was admitted for IV antibiotics and showed rapid clinical improvement within 48 hours.

neurosyphilis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Meningovascular neurosyphilis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset right-sided weakness and expressive aphasia.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with no cardiovascular risk factors presented with an acute ischaemic stroke in the left MCA territory. Further investigation revealed positive serum syphilis serology and CSF pleocytosis with positive VDRL, suggesting endarteritis. She received IV penicillin and intensive physiotherapy, achieving partial recovery of motor function.

neurosyphilis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: General paresis (paretic neurosyphilis)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive memory loss, personality changes, and delusions of grandeur.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male was referred by psychiatry after presenting with a six-month history of irritability and cognitive decline mimicking early-onset dementia. Neurological examination noted a fine tremor of the tongue and hands; CSF testing confirmed neurosyphilis. Despite IV penicillin treatment, he was left with permanent cognitive deficits requiring long-term residential care.

neurosyphilis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Tabes dorsalis
  presenting_complaint: Sharp, stabbing "lightning pains" in the legs and an unsteady gait.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male presented with sensory ataxia and a positive Romberg's sign. Examination revealed absent lower limb reflexes and impaired vibration sense, alongside classic Argyll Robertson pupils. He was treated for late-stage neurosyphilis, which halted progression, though the neuropathic pains required ongoing management with gabapentin.

neurosyphilis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Syphilitic uveitis and optic neuritis
  presenting_complaint: Blurred vision and pain in the left eye for two weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old male was referred by an optician after fundoscopy showed optic disc swelling and vitreous cells. Serum syphilis screens were reactive, and CSF analysis confirmed CNS involvement. He received a full course of IV benzylpenicillin and a tapering course of oral steroids, resulting in significant visual acuity recovery.

neurosyphilis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Otosyphilis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden sensorineural hearing loss and persistent vertigo.
  summary_of_course: A 51-year-old female presented with unilateral deafness and tinnitus. Audiometry confirmed high-frequency hearing loss, and syphilis serology was strongly positive. She was treated with the neurosyphilis protocol of IV antibiotics, which stabilised her hearing but did not fully restore the lost auditory threshold.

neurosyphilis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Late congenital neurosyphilis
  presenting_complaint: Developmental delay and interstitial keratitis in a paediatric patient.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy presented with inflammatory eye disease and Hutchinson's teeth. Maternal history was significant for untreated syphilis during pregnancy. Lumbar puncture confirmed neurosyphilis, and he was treated with a 14-day course of IV penicillin G, requiring multidisciplinary support for educational needs.

neurosyphilis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Syphilitic gumma
  presenting_complaint: New-onset focal seizures and persistent nocturnal headaches.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male's MRI head scan showed a peripherally enhancing mass lesion in the right parietal lobe, initially suspected to be a high-grade glioma. Subsequent serology and biopsy confirmed a syphilitic gumma. The lesion resolved completely following intensive antibiotic therapy, avoiding the need for neurosurgical resection.

neurosyphilis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Syphilitic meningomyelitis
  presenting_complaint: Progressive lower limb weakness and urinary incontinence.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male presented with a subacute spastic paraparesis and a sensory level at T10. Spinal MRI showed longitudinal T2 hyperintensity, and CSF VDRL was reactive. He was diagnosed with syphilitic meningomyelitis and treated with IV penicillin, resulting in a slow but steady improvement in mobility over several months.

neurosyphilis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Neurosyphilis with Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction
  presenting_complaint: High fever, tachycardia, and worsening neurological symptoms shortly after starting treatment.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male with known meningovascular syphilis was started on IV penicillin. Within six hours, he developed rigors and a transient worsening of his hemiparesis. This was managed supportively with paracetamol and fluids; the reaction subsided within 24 hours, and he completed the antibiotic course successfully.

neurosyphilis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Neurosyphilis mimicking Alzheimer's disease
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive dementia and urinary frequency.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female was initially diagnosed with atypical Alzheimer's due to prominent frontal lobe symptoms. Routine screening revealed a positive RPR (1:32) and Treponema pallidum enzyme immunoassay (EIA). CSF analysis confirmed neurosyphilis, and while penicillin arrested the decline, her cognitive function remained significantly impaired.

neurosyphilis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute syphilitic encephalitis
  presenting_complaint: Status epilepticus and fluctuating consciousness.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male was admitted to the ICU following prolonged seizure activity. CSF PCR for HSV was negative, but VDRL was reactive at 1:16. He was treated with IV benzylpenicillin and levetiracetam, eventually being discharged with no focal neurological deficits but requiring long-term anti-epileptic medication.

neurosyphilis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Neurosyphilis with multiple cranial nerve palsies
  presenting_complaint: Double vision and right-sided facial drooping.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female presented with concurrent III and VII cranial nerve palsies. Serological testing for HIV was negative, but syphilis screening was positive. CSF pleocytosis confirmed neurosyphilis, and the nerve palsies resolved fully after a 14-day course of procaine penicillin and probenecid.

neurosyphilis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Neurosyphilis treatment failure
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent headaches and rising RPR titres six months post-treatment.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old HIV-positive male previously treated for neurosyphilis with IV penicillin presented with a relapse of symptoms. Repeat CSF analysis showed a persistent pleocytosis and a four-fold increase in VDRL titre. He was re-treated with a more prolonged course of IV antibiotics and higher doses, eventually achieving serological and clinical stability.

neurosyphilis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Syphilitic polyradiculopathy
  presenting_complaint: Severe lower back pain and bilateral foot drop.
  summary_of_course: A 57-year-old male presented with symptoms mimicking Guillain-Barré syndrome. Electromyography (EMG) showed a polyradiculopathy pattern, and CSF studies revealed high protein and a positive syphilis screen. He was treated for neurosyphilis, leading to a gradual recovery of motor function over the following year.

neurosyphilis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Neurosyphilis presenting as acute psychosis
  presenting_complaint: Auditory hallucinations and aggressive behaviour.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male with no psychiatric history was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. Physical examination revealed hyperreflexia, and subsequent bloods showed a reactive RPR. CSF-VDRL was positive, and his psychotic symptoms resolved completely following neurosyphilis treatment, allowing for discharge without antipsychotic medication.

neurosyphilis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Taboparesis
  presenting_complaint: Combined symptoms of dementia and sensory ataxia.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male presented with a complex picture of cognitive decline, personality changes, and a broad-based gait. Investigations confirmed features of both general paresis and tabes dorsalis. He was treated with IV penicillin, which stabilised his condition, though he remained dependent for activities of daily living.

neurosyphilis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Neurosyphilis with intracranial hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Chronic headache, nausea, and pulsatile tinnitus.
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old female was initially suspected of having idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) due to papilloedema and high opening pressure (35 cm H2O). However, CSF analysis showed a lymphocytic pleocytosis and positive syphilis serology. Her symptoms and papilloedema resolved following treatment for neurosyphilis and a temporary course of acetazolamide.

neurosyphilis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: End-stage neurosyphilis
  presenting_complaint: Severe cachexia, mutism, and tetraplegia.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male was admitted from a nursing home with advanced neurological devastation. Historical records suggested untreated syphilis in his youth. Despite a course of IV penicillin, there was no clinical improvement due to extensive cortical atrophy and chronic gliosis, and the focus of care was shifted to palliation.
