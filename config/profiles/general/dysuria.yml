  primary_diagnosis: Fournier's Gangrene
  presenting_complaint: Severe dysuria and rapidly progressing perineal swelling.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with poorly controlled diabetes presented in septic shock with necrotic changes to the scrotum.

  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Urinary Tract Infection
  presenting_complaint: Irritability, crying during micturition, and unexplained fever.
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old girl was brought to A&E with a 39°C fever and secondary enuresis. A clean-catch urine sample grew >10^5 CFU/mL of Klebsiella species, and she was treated with oral cefalexin. An ultrasound of the renal tract was scheduled to exclude vesicoureteric reflux.

dysuria_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Interstitial Cystitis (Bladder Pain Syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic suprapubic pain relieved by voiding and severe dysuria.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female reported a two-year history of pelvic pain and extreme urinary frequency (up to 30 times per day). Extensive investigations, including repeated cultures and cystoscopy with biopsy, ruled out infection and malignancy. Management involved dietary modifications, bladder instillations, and amitriptyline for neuropathic pain.

dysuria_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Distal Ureteric Stone
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of colicky loin-to-groin pain and terminal dysuria.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male presented with excruciating pain and visible haematuria. A non-contrast CT KUB identified a 4mm calculus at the vesicoureteric junction. The patient was managed conservatively with tamsulosin and NSAIDs, successfully passing the stone three days later.

dysuria_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Catheter-Associated UTI (CAUTI)
  presenting_complaint: Cloudy urine and new-onset rigors in a catheterised patient.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male in the ICU post-laparotomy developed a fever and increased oxygen requirements. Urine culture from the long-term indwelling catheter grew multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The catheter was replaced, and sensitivities guided a course of IV meropenem.

dysuria_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Urethral Stricture
  presenting_complaint: Straining to void, poor stream, and chronic mild dysuria.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with a history of pelvic trauma ten years prior reported worsening obstructive symptoms. Uroflowmetry demonstrated a 'plateau' flow rate of 5ml/s, and retrograde urethrography confirmed a 2cm bulbar stricture. He underwent a successful optical urethrotomy to restore luminal patency.

dysuria_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Urinary Schistosomiasis
  presenting_complaint: Terminal haematuria and dysuria following foreign travel.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male presented three months after swimming in Lake Malawi with persistent urinary irritation. Terminal urine microscopy revealed characteristic terminal-spined eggs of Schistosoma haematobium. He was treated with two doses of praziquantel, leading to a full clinical recovery.

dysuria_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Cyclophosphamide-induced Haemorrhagic Cystitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe bladder pain and gross haematuria with clots.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female receiving high-dose cyclophosphamide for vasculitis developed acute dysuria and bleeding.

dysuria_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Genitourinary Tuberculosis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic dysuria, weight loss, and sterile pyuria.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male from an endemic region presented with persistent urinary symptoms unresponsive to standard antibiotics. Repeated urine cultures showed leucocytes but no bacterial growth (sterile pyuria), but three early-morning urines were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis on PCR. He commenced a six-month course of quadruple anti-tuberculous therapy.

dysuria_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Vulvovaginal Candidiasis
  presenting_complaint: External dysuria and thick, white vaginal discharge.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female presented with intense vulval itching and 'stinging' when urine touched the inflamed skin. Clinical examination showed a typical 'cottage cheese' discharge and vulval erythema. A single dose of oral fluconazole 150mg resulted in rapid symptom resolution.

  primary_diagnosis: Urethral Foreign Body
  presenting_complaint: Acute urethral pain and inability to pass urine.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male with a history of borderline personality disorder presented to A&E in significant distress. An X-ray of the pelvis revealed a metallic sewing needle lodged in the penile urethra. The object was removed under general anaesthesia via endoscopic retrieval.

  primary_diagnosis: Radiation Cystitis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic dysuria and recurrent haematuria post-radiotherapy.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male who underwent pelvic radiotherapy for prostate cancer five years ago presented with persistent bladder irritation. Cystoscopy showed multiple telangiectatic vessels and a pale, scarred bladder wall. He was managed with hyperbaric oxygen therapy to improve tissue vascularity and reduce bleeding episodes.

dysuria_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Chemical Cystitis
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of dysuria and urethral stinging.
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old female developed sudden urinary discomfort shortly after using a new brand of scented bubble bath and vaginal deodorants.
