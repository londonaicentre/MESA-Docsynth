bell_palsy_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic Bell's palsy
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset right-sided facial drooping and inability to close the eye.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female presented to her GP with a 12-hour history of unilateral facial weakness and loss of taste. Clinical examination confirmed a lower motor neurone lesion (House-Brackmann grade III) with no other neurological deficits. She was prescribed a 10-day course of prednisolone and lubricating eye drops, resulting in a complete recovery at the six-week follow-up.

bell_palsy_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Bell's palsy in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Sudden left-sided facial paralysis and retroauricular pain.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old woman in her third trimester of pregnancy presented to A&E with House-Brackmann grade V paralysis. Due to the increased risk of permanent deficit in pregnancy-related cases, she was started on high-dose prednisolone immediately. Despite initial concerns, she showed gradual improvement post-partum, though retained mild residual synkinesis.

bell_palsy_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Bell's palsy with corneal ulceration
  presenting_complaint: Right facial weakness and a red, painful eye.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with severe Bell's palsy failed to use eye protection or nocturnal taping as advised. He presented to the ophthalmology clinic one week later with significant conjunctival injection and a central corneal ulcer due to lagophthalmos. He required intensive topical antibiotics and a temporary tarsorrhaphy alongside his steroid treatment for the facial nerve.

bell_palsy_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Bell's palsy
  presenting_complaint: Drooping of the left side of the mouth and dribbling.
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old boy was brought to the paediatric assessment unit by his parents after waking up with facial asymmetry. A diagnosis of idiopathic Bell's palsy was made after excluding middle ear infection and Lyme disease. He was treated with a weight-adjusted dose of prednisolone and achieved a full House-Brackmann grade I recovery within one month.

bell_palsy_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent idiopathic Bell's palsy
  presenting_complaint: Recurrence of right-sided facial weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with a previous history of left-sided Bell's palsy three years ago presented with new right-sided weakness. Investigations including an MRI of the internal auditory meatus and parotid gland were normal, ruling out structural lesions. She was treated with prednisolone and antiviral medication (aciclovir) due to the severity, with slow but steady improvement.

bell_palsy_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Bell's palsy mimicking acute stroke
  presenting_complaint: Sudden facial droop and slurred speech.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with hypertension and atrial fibrillation was brought to the hyperacute stroke unit. Examination revealed forehead involvement (lower motor neurone pattern) and no limb weakness, distinguishing it from an upper motor neurone stroke. He was diagnosed with Bell's palsy and discharged with prednisolone and eye care instructions.

bell_palsy_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Bell's palsy with synkinesis
  presenting_complaint: Involuntary eye closing when smiling.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old patient presented 12 months after a severe episode of Bell's palsy that had not fully resolved. She complained of "crocodile tears" and significant facial spasms during voluntary movements. She was referred to a specialist facial palsy clinic for botulinum toxin injections and neuromuscular retraining.

bell_palsy_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Bell's palsy in a diabetic patient
  presenting_complaint: Complete left-sided facial paralysis.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 88 mmol/mol) presented with House-Brackmann grade VI palsy. His recovery was significantly delayed and incomplete compared to non-diabetic cohorts, likely due to underlying microvascular disease. He remained at grade III at six months despite early steroid intervention.

bell_palsy_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Bell's palsy secondary to Lyme disease
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral facial weakness and malaise.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old girl presented with sequential bilateral facial nerve palsy after a camping trip in the Scottish Highlands. Serology confirmed Borrelia burgdorferi infection, and she was treated with a 21-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone. Her facial function returned to normal over three months, and the diagnosis was revised from idiopathic Bell's to Lyme-associated palsy.

bell_pals_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Bell's palsy with hyperacusis
  presenting_complaint: Left facial droop and painful sensitivity to loud noises.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old musician presented with acute facial palsy and distressing hyperacusis in the ipsilateral ear, indicating involvement of the nerve to stapedius. Clinical examination confirmed Bell's palsy, and he was started on prednisolone. The hyperacusis resolved within two weeks, followed by the facial weakness by week eight.

bell_palsy_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Ramsay Hunt Syndrome (initially misdiagnosed as Bell's)
  presenting_complaint: Severe right facial palsy and ear pain.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male was initially diagnosed with Bell's palsy and started on steroids. Two days later, a painful vesicular rash appeared in the external auditory canal and on the soft palate. The diagnosis was updated to Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, and aciclovir was added to his regimen; however, he was left with permanent moderate facial weakness.

bell_palsy_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Bell's palsy
  presenting_complaint: Slight asymmetry of the smile and difficulty whistling.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old student noticed mild weakness of the left side of her face during a video call. Examination showed House-Brackmann grade II palsy with minimal functional deficit. Given the mild presentation and patient preference, she opted for conservative management without steroids and achieved full resolution within three weeks.

bell_palsy_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Bell's palsy in an immunocompromised patient
  presenting_complaint: Rapid onset left facial paralysis.
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old male undergoing chemotherapy for lymphoma developed acute facial palsy. Due to his immunocompromised state, he was admitted for intravenous aciclovir and oral prednisolone to prevent complications. His recovery was monitored closely by both neurology and oncology teams, achieving a grade II recovery.

bell_palsy_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute Bell's palsy (Atypical presentation)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive facial weakness over seven days.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female presented with facial weakness that had gradually worsened over a week, rather than the typical 48-72 hour window. This atypical tempo prompted an MRI of the head and parotid ultrasound to exclude a slow-growing neoplasm. Imaging was clear, and she was treated for an atypical Bell's palsy with a good eventual outcome.

bell_palsy_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Bell's palsy with retroauricular pain
  presenting_complaint: Sharp pain behind the ear followed by facial drooping.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old male experienced 24 hours of intense mastoid pain before the onset of right-sided facial paralysis. The presence of pre-paralytic pain is a known feature of Bell's palsy and often correlates with a more severe course. He was treated with prednisolone and required strong analgesia for the first week.

bell_palsy_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Bell's palsy with complete denervation
  presenting_complaint: Total loss of movement on the left side of the face.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female presented with House-Brackmann grade VI palsy. Electromyography (EMG) performed at day 14 showed >90% denervation, suggesting a poor prognosis for spontaneous recovery. She was offered surgical decompression of the facial nerve but opted for intensive physiotherapy and pharmacological management, resulting in partial recovery.

bell_palsy_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Bell's palsy following viral prodrome
  presenting_complaint: Facial weakness following a "flu-like" illness.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male developed left-sided facial palsy four days after recovering from an upper respiratory tract infection. This common association with viral triggers supported the diagnosis of Bell's palsy. He responded rapidly to a standard course of steroids and returned to baseline within 14 days.

bell_palsy_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Bell's palsy with psychological distress
  presenting_complaint: Inability to close the right eye and severe anxiety regarding appearance.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old model presented with acute Bell's palsy, which caused significant psychological impact and withdrawal from social activities. Alongside prednisolone and eye care, she was referred for psychological support to manage the distress associated with facial disfigurement. Her physical symptoms resolved in two months, but she required longer-term counselling for body dysmorphia.

bell_palsy_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Bilateral idiopathic Bell's palsy
  presenting_complaint: Simultaneous loss of movement on both sides of the face.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male presented with a rare case of simultaneous bilateral facial palsy. Extensive investigations, including lumbar puncture for Guillain-Barré syndrome and bloods for sarcoidosis and HIV, were negative. He was diagnosed with idiopathic bilateral Bell's palsy and treated with high-dose steroids, showing symmetrical improvement over four months.

bell_palsy_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Bell's palsy in a patient with Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent facial swelling and new facial paralysis.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male with a history of a fissured tongue and recurrent lip swelling presented with his third episode of facial palsy. The triad of symptoms confirmed Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome rather than simple idiopathic Bell's palsy. He was managed with steroids and referred to a specialist multidisciplinary team for long-term management of his recurrent craniofacial swelling.
