  presenting_complaint: Fever, neck stiffness, and photophobia
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old university student presented with a purpuric rash and a GCS of 10. Lumbar puncture confirmed Neisseria meningitidis, and CT showed effacement of the sulci suggesting inflammatory cerebral oedema. He was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and dexamethasone to reduce the inflammatory response and intracranial pressure.

cerebral_oedema_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Hepatic encephalopathy with cerebral oedema in acute liver failure
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice and grade IV encephalopathy
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with paracetamol overdose developed hyperacute liver failure. She progressed to deep coma with signs of increased ICP due to ammonia-induced astrocyte swelling. Despite aggressive management with lactulose, rifaximin, and continuous veno-venous haemofiltration, she succumbed to brainstem herniation.

cerebral_oedema_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Cerebral oedema secondary to cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST)
  presenting_complaint: Thunderclap headache and papilloedema
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female on the combined oral contraceptive pill presented with a severe, progressive headache. MR venogram confirmed thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus with associated venous infarction and focal cerebral oedema. She was started on low-molecular-weight heparin, which prevented further venous congestion and allowed the oedema to subside.

cerebral_oedema_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Global hypoxic-ischaemic cerebral oedema
  presenting_complaint: Comatose post-cardiac arrest
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male suffered an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with a 15-minute downtime before ROSC. CT brain at 24 hours showed loss of grey-white matter differentiation and diffuse sulcal effacement consistent with global cytotoxic oedema. Prognosis was deemed poor based on clinical examination and neuroimaging, and care was eventually withdrawn.
