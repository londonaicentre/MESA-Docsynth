psoriatic_or_enteropathic_arthropathy_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymmetric Psoriatic Oligoarthritis
  presenting_complaint: Painful swelling of the right knee and left second toe.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with a 10-year history of plaque psoriasis presented to the outpatient clinic with subacute onset of a swollen knee and "sausage-like" swelling of the toe (dactylitis). Clinical examination and ultrasound confirmed synovitis and tenosynovitis; ESR was mildly elevated at 28 mm/hr. He was commenced on Methotrexate 15mg weekly and Naproxen, showing significant improvement in joint mobility within eight weeks.

psoriatic_or_enteropathic_arthropathy_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Arthritis Mutilans
  presenting_complaint: Severe deformity and loss of function in both hands.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female with long-standing, poorly controlled psoriatic arthritis presented with chronic, debilitating pain. Radiographs revealed extensive osteolysis and "pencil-in-cup" deformities of the distal interphalangeal joints, characteristic of arthritis mutilans. Despite historical treatment failures, she was initiated on a TNF-alpha inhibitor (Adalimumab), which stabilised the inflammatory markers but required occupational therapy for functional adaptation.

psoriatic_or_enteropathic_arthropathy_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 1 Enteropathic Arthropathy
  presenting_complaint: Acute flare of bloody diarrhoea and painful swollen ankles.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) was admitted with a severe bowel flare and concomitant bilateral ankle synovitis. The joint symptoms mirrored the intestinal activity, consistent with Type 1 pauciarticular enteropathic arthritis. Management involved intravenous hydrocortisone for the UC, which led to rapid resolution of both gastrointestinal and articular symptoms.

psoriatic_or_enteropathic_arthropathy_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 2 Enteropathic Arthropathy
  presenting_complaint: Persistent pain in the small joints of the hands and wrists.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female with Crohn's disease in clinical remission complained of chronic, symmetrical polyarthritis. Unlike her previous bowel flares, these joint symptoms persisted independently of her GI status, diagnostic of Type 2 polyarticular enteropathic arthritis. She was successfully transitioned from Sulfasalazine to Methotrexate, achieving better control of her peripheral joint disease.

psoriatic_or_enteropathic_arthropathy_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Juvenile Psoriatic Arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Limp and swollen finger in a 12-year-old.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old girl presented with a persistent limp due to right hip pain and a dactylitic third finger on the left hand. Her mother has extensive psoriasis, though the child only had minor retro-auricular scaling. Investigations showed an elevated CRP and positive HLA-B27; she was diagnosed with paediatric-onset psoriatic arthritis and started on Etanercept with excellent clinical response.

psoriatic_or_enteropathic_arthropathy_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Psoriatic Spondylitis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic lower back pain and morning stiffness.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male presented with a 2-year history of inflammatory back pain that improved with exercise but not rest. Physical exam noted reduced lumbar flexion (Schober's test 3cm) and scalp psoriasis. MRI of the sacroiliac joints showed bilateral sacroiliitis, confirming axial psoriatic arthritis; he was managed with Secukinumab after failing two different NSAIDs.

psoriatic_or_enteropathic_arthropathy_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Psoriatic Arthritis with Acute Anterior Uveitis
  presenting_complaint: Red, painful right eye and swollen distal joints.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female with known psoriasis presented to A&E with photophobia and blurred vision alongside pain in her DIP joints. Slit-lamp examination confirmed acute anterior uveitis, an extra-articular manifestation of her psoriatic arthropathy. She received topical steroids for the eye and was escalated to Infliximab to manage both her ocular and joint inflammation.

psoriatic_or_enteropathic_arthropathy_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Psoriatic Arthritis with Metabolic Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Multiple joint pains, obesity, and poorly controlled hypertension.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with a BMI of 34 and Type 2 Diabetes presented with polyarticular joint pain. Bloods showed hyperuricaemia, complicating the diagnosis between gout and psoriatic arthritis; however, nail pitting and dactylitis confirmed the latter. Treatment was complex due to fatty liver disease contraindicating Methotrexate, necessitating the use of Apremilast.

psoriatic_or_enteropathic_arthropathy_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Enteropathic Sacroiliitis
  presenting_complaint: Deep buttock pain and nocturnal awakening.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male with Crohn's disease reported worsening buttock pain and stiffness. X-rays showed Grade 2 sacroiliitis, and HLA-B27 testing was positive. He was diagnosed with enteropathic axial spondyloarthritis; because his bowel disease was quiescent, he was treated with targeted physiotherapy and Celecoxib, with close monitoring for GI symptom relapse.

psoriatic_or_enteropathic_arthropathy_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Symmetrical Psoriatic Polyarthritis
  presenting_complaint: Symmetrical hand and wrist swelling mimicking Rheumatoid Arthritis.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female presented with symmetrical small joint involvement of the MCPs and PIPs. While initially suspected to be RA, she was rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP negative, and a skin survey revealed hidden gluteal cleft psoriasis. This "RA-like" presentation of psoriatic arthritis was treated with Leflunomide, resulting in a moderate reduction in DAS28 score.

psoriatic_or_enteropathic_arthropathy_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Psoriatic Onycho-pachydermo-periostitis (POPP)
  presenting_complaint: Painful swelling of the great toes and severe nail changes.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male presented with a rare variant of psoriatic arthritis involving the hallux. Examination showed severe onychodystrophy, soft tissue swelling of the distal phalanx, and radiographic evidence of periosteal reaction. Diagnosis of POPP was made, and due to the severity of pain and functional impact, he was started on Ustekinumab.

psoriatic_or_enteropathic_arthropathy_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-Colectomy Enteropathic Arthropathy
  presenting_complaint: New onset knee and wrist pain following bowel surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female who underwent a total proctocolectomy for Ulcerative Colitis two years ago presented with new peripheral arthritis. Despite the removal of the colon, her enteropathic arthropathy manifested, demonstrating that joint symptoms can occur post-surgery. She was treated with Sulfasalazine, which provided good control of her peripheral synovitis.

psoriatic_or_enteropathic_arthropathy_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Psoriatic Arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent joint flares despite multiple biologic therapies.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male with severe PsA failed sequential trials of Etanercept and Adalimumab. He presented with high disease activity (DAPSA score 45) and worsening skin plaques. He was switched to a JAK inhibitor (Tofacitinib), which finally achieved a low disease activity state and improved his quality of life scores significantly.

psoriatic_or_enteropathic_arthropathy_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Psoriatic Arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Occasional stiffness in the fingers and mild skin patches.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female presented to her GP with intermittent stiffness in her distal joints and small patches of psoriasis on her elbows. Inflammatory markers were normal, and there was no erosive change on X-ray. She was managed conservatively in the community with topical Vitamin D analogues for her skin and PRN Ibuprofen for joint symptoms.

psoriatic_or_enteropathic_arthropathy_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Enteropathic Arthropathy with Pyoderma Gangrenosum
  presenting_complaint: Large, painful leg ulcer and swollen knees.
  summary_of_course: A 47-year-old male with known Crohn's disease presented with a rapidly enlarging, necrotic ulcer on his pretibial area and bilateral knee effusions. The ulcer was diagnosed as pyoderma gangrenosum, associated with an extra-intestinal flare of his enteropathic arthritis. He required admission for high-dose systemic corticosteroids and Ciclosporin to manage the dermatological and articular crisis.

psoriatic_or_enteropathic_arthropathy_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Psoriatic Arthritis in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Planning pregnancy with active joint disease.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old female with PsA wished to conceive but was currently taking Methotrexate. Her medication was switched to Certolizumab Pegol (a TNF inhibitor safe in pregnancy) and high-dose folic acid. Her arthritis remained stable throughout the second and third trimesters, though she required a brief course of Prednisolone for a postpartum flare.

psoriatic_or_enteropathic_arthropathy_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic Psoriatic Arthritis Flare
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, severe worsening of joint pain after stopping medication.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with chronic PsA stopped his Methotrexate abruptly due to a misunderstanding of COVID-19 vaccine guidance. He presented with an acute polyarticular flare and erythrodermic psoriasis. He was hospitalised for intensive topical therapy and re-initiation of systemic treatment under close monitoring of his renal and hepatic function.

psoriatic_or_enteropathic_arthropathy_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Sinus Psoriatic Arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Unexplained knee effusion without obvious skin disease.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male presented with a large, sterile right knee effusion (pauciarticular). He denied any history of psoriasis, but a detailed examination revealed subtle pitting of the fingernails and a small patch of psoriasis in the umbilicus. This "psoriasis sine psoriasis" presentation led to a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis, confirmed by MRI evidence of enthesitis at the Achilles tendon.

psoriatic_or_enteropathic_arthropathy_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Psoriatic Arthritis with Cervical Spine Involvement
  presenting_complaint: Neck pain and tingling in the hands.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female with long-standing PsA presented with progressive neck stiffness and paraesthesia in a glove-and-stocking distribution. Lateral flexion-extension X-rays of the cervical spine revealed atlanto-axial subluxation, a rare but serious complication of axial PsA. She was referred for urgent neurosurgical assessment and stabilization to prevent spinal cord compression.

psoriatic_or_enteropathic_arthropathy_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Enteropathic Arthropathy (Type 1)
  presenting_complaint: Swollen right knee and acute abdominal pain.
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old male with a new diagnosis of Crohn's disease presented with an acute, hot, swollen right knee. Joint aspiration ruled out sepsis (culture negative, no crystals), and the synovial fluid showed inflammatory cells. The arthritis was identified as Type 1 enteropathic arthropathy coinciding with his initial IBD presentation; both responded well to a course of oral Prednisolone and Mesalazine.
