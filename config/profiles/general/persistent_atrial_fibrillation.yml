  primary_diagnosis: Persistent Atrial Fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations following heavy alcohol consumption.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male presented with "holiday heart syndrome" that failed to revert spontaneously. The AF persisted for 12 days, necessitating pharmacological cardioversion in the medical assessment unit. He was advised on alcohol cessation and monitored for recurrence.

persistent_atrial_fibrillation_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic Persistent Atrial Fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Irregular pulse detected during routine flu vaccination.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male was found to have an irregular pulse by a practice nurse. ECG confirmed AF, and the patient denied any symptoms, stating he felt "perfectly fine." Given his age and hypertension (CHA2DS2-VASc 3), he was commenced on Rivaroxaban despite the lack of symptoms.

persistent_atrial_fibrillation_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Persistent Atrial Fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Daytime somnolence and palpitations.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female with a BMI of 42 and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) was diagnosed with persistent AF. Management focused on treating the underlying OSA with CPAP and weight loss alongside rhythm control. Her AF burden significantly decreased following these lifestyle interventions and Sotalol therapy.

persistent_atrial_fibrillation_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Persistent Atrial Fibrillation in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations and light-headedness at 28 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old pregnant female presented with persistent AF lasting eight days. Due to the risks of certain medications in pregnancy, she was managed cautiously with Digoxin for rate control and LMWH for anticoagulation. Sinus rhythm was restored via a low-energy DCCV under obstetric supervision.

persistent_atrial_fibrillation_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Persistent Atrial Fibrillation triggered by Pulmonary Embolism
  presenting_complaint: Pleuritic chest pain and acute shortness of breath.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male was admitted with a large segmental PE. The physiological stress triggered persistent AF which remained for the duration of his ten-day hospital stay. He was transitioned from a heparin infusion to Rivaroxaban for long-term management of both the PE and AF.

  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent Persistent Atrial Fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Return of palpitations six months after cryoablation.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male who previously underwent cryoablation for persistent AF presented with a recurrence of symptoms. ECG confirmed he had reverted to AF. He was scheduled for a repeat electrophysiology study and radiofrequency ablation to target pulmonary vein reconnection.

persistent_atrial_fibrillation_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Persistent Atrial Fibrillation in Chronic Kidney Disease
  presenting_complaint: Generalised malaise and irregular pulse.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with Stage 4 CKD (eGFR 22) was diagnosed with persistent AF. Anticoagulation was challenging due to his high bleeding risk and renal impairment; he was started on a reduced dose of Apixaban (2.5mg BD). Rate control was achieved with cautious titration of Bisoprolol.

persistent_atrial_fibrillation_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Persistent Atrial Fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Increased cough and breathlessness (COPD exacerbation).
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male with severe COPD developed AF during an infective exacerbation. The AF persisted for two weeks after the infection resolved. Beta-blockers were avoided due to his reactive airway disease, so Verapamil was utilised for rate control with good effect.

persistent_atrial_fibrillation_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Persistent Atrial Fibrillation with Pre-excitation
  presenting_complaint: Rapid palpitations and near-syncope.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male with known Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome presented with persistent AF. The ECG showed a dangerously rapid ventricular rate due to conduction over the accessory pathway. He required urgent synchronised DCCV due to haemodynamic instability and was fast-tracked for accessory pathway ablation.

persistent_atrial_fibrillation_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Persistent Atrial Fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Lethargy and pale conjunctiva.
  summary_of_course: A 71-year-old female was found to have persistent AF during an admission for iron deficiency anaemia (Hb 72g/L) caused by a GI bleed. The AF was thought to be exacerbated by the high-output state. Following blood transfusion and stabilisation of the bleed, her heart rate was controlled with Atenolol.

persistent_atrial_fibrillation_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Persistent Atrial Fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Mild breathlessness in a palliative setting.
  summary_of_course: A 91-year-old male in a nursing home with advanced dementia was noted to have an irregular pulse and mild tachypnoea. ECG confirmed persistent AF.
