  primary_diagnosis: Chronic large effusion secondary to myxoedema
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue, cold intolerance, and weight gain
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female presented with severe lethargy and bradycardia. Laboratory tests showed a TSH of 115 mIU/L and nearly undetectable free T4. CXR showed a "water-bottle" heart silhouette, and TTE confirmed a massive 28mm circumferential effusion without tamponade physiology. The effusion gradually resolved over three months with cautious levothyroxine replacement.

pericardial_effusion_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic pericardial effusion post-PCI
  presenting_complaint: Sudden collapse and bradycardia during coronary intervention
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for an LAD stenosis. During stent deployment, she became suddenly hypotensive with a heart rate of 35 bpm. Bedside TTE in the cath lab showed a rapidly accumulating effusion due to coronary perforation. A pericardial drain was inserted immediately, and the perforation was sealed with a covered stent.

pericardial_effusion_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Tuberculous pericarditis
  presenting_complaint: Night sweats, weight loss, and chronic cough
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male from an endemic region presented with constitutional symptoms and increasing abdominal girth. TTE revealed a 20mm loculated pericardial effusion with significant fibrinous "shaggy" appearance. Pericardial fluid analysis was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis on PCR. He was commenced on quadruple anti-TB therapy and a tapering course of steroids to prevent constriction.

pericardial_effusion_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Incidental physiological pericardial effusion
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic; found during routine health screen
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male underwent a private health check including a screening echocardiogram. TTE identified a trace amount of pericardial fluid (3mm) isolated to the posterior wall. Physical examination, ECG, and inflammatory markers were entirely normal. The finding was documented as a physiological variant, and no further intervention or follow-up was required.

pericardial_effusion_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Constrictive-effusive pericarditis
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral leg oedema and raised JVP
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with a history of mediastinal radiotherapy for lymphoma 10 years ago presented with signs of right-sided heart failure. TTE and cardiac MRI showed a 14mm effusion trapped between a thickened, calcified visceral and parietal pericardium. Despite drainage of the fluid, his intracardiac pressures remained elevated (Kussmaul's sign). He subsequently underwent a total pericardiectomy.

pericardial_effusion_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Pregnancy-related benign pericardial effusion
  presenting_complaint: Mild breathlessness in the third trimester
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female, G1P0 at 36 weeks gestation, complained of mild SOB. TTE showed a 6mm isolated pericardial effusion with no other abnormalities. Given the absence of inflammatory markers or cardiac compromise, it was managed as a benign effusion of pregnancy. A repeat TTE six weeks postpartum showed complete spontaneous resolution.

pericardial_effusion_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-infarction ventricular free wall rupture
  presenting_complaint: Sudden severe chest pain and syncope five days post-MI
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female was recovering from an anterior STEMI when she developed sudden haemodynamic collapse. Bedside ultrasound showed a large haemopericardium with tamponade signs. She was rushed to the operating theatre where a small tear in the infarcted left ventricular wall was found. The rupture was repaired with a bovine pericardial patch, but she unfortunately died in the ICU from multi-organ failure.

pericardial_effusion_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Kawasaki disease with associated effusion
  presenting_complaint: Persistent fever, "strawberry tongue", and hand oedema
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old girl presented with classic features of Kawasaki disease. Initial TTE showed normal coronary arteries but a 5mm global pericardial effusion. She was treated with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and aspirin. Follow-up imaging showed resolution of the effusion by day 10, though she remained under long-term surveillance for coronary artery aneurysms.

pericardial_effusion_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Sepsis-induced pericardial effusion with fluid overload
  presenting_complaint: Oliguria and increasing oxygen requirements in ICU
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male was in the ICU for faecal peritonitis and septic shock, having received 12 litres of fluid resuscitation. He developed new-onset atrial fibrillation. TTE demonstrated a moderate 18mm pericardial effusion and global peripheral oedema. The effusion was managed conservatively with aggressive diuresis and optimising renal replacement therapy, resolving as his fluid balance became negative.

pericardial_effusion_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic idiopathic recurrent pericarditis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of sharp chest pain over two years
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male presented with his fourth episode of pericarditis in 24 months. Each episode was characterised by a 10-12mm effusion and raised CRP. Standard treatments with NSAIDs and colchicine provided only temporary relief. Due to corticosteroid dependence, he was eventually commenced on the IL-1 inhibitor Anakinra, which resulted in sustained remission and disappearance of the effusion.

pericardial_effusion_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Cholesterol pericarditis ("Gold Paint" effusion)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic exertional dyspnoea and dull chest heaviness
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with poorly controlled hyperlipidaemia presented with a massive, longstanding pericardial effusion on CXR. TTE showed a 40mm global effusion with a "shimmering" appearance on ultrasound. Pericardiocentesis yielded thick, yellowish fluid containing cholesterol crystals. A pericardial window was eventually required due to frequent re-accumulation and concern for future constriction.

pericardial_effusion_020:
  primary_diagnosis: HIV-associated CMV pericarditis
  presenting_complaint: Fever, dyspnoea, and cough in an immunocompromised patient
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male with known HIV and a CD4 count of 45 cells/uL presented with subacute respiratory distress. TTE revealed a 16mm pericardial effusion. Pericardial fluid PCR was positive for Cytomegalovirus (CMV). He was treated with intravenous ganciclovir and optimization of his antiretroviral therapy (ART), leading to gradual resolution of the effusion over several weeks.
