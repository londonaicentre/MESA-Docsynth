  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female with relapsing-remitting MS presented with a new onset of the "MS hug" and paroxysmal limb pain. MRI confirmed new demyelinating lesions in the thoracic spinal cord. Pain was managed with a combination of carbamazepine and baclofen for concurrent spasticity.

neuropathic_pain_011:
  primary_diagnosis: HIV-associated distal sensory polyneuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Persistent burning sensations in the soles of the feet, worse at night.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male on long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) presented with symmetrical distal sensory loss. Despite a suppressed viral load, the neuropathic pain remained severe. High-concentration capsaicin (8%) patches were applied in the outpatient clinic, providing significant relief for three months.

neuropathic_pain_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Carpal tunnel syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Numbness and tingling in the thumb, index, and middle fingers, especially at night.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old female office worker reported waking up needing to "shake out" her hands. Positive Tinel’s and Phalen’s signs were noted on examination. Conservative management with nocturnal wrist splints and a corticosteroid injection provided complete resolution of her mild symptoms.

neuropathic_pain_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic small fibre neuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Chronic, widespread burning pain and autonomic symptoms including dry eyes and orthostatic dizziness.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female presented with normal electromyography and nerve conduction studies.
