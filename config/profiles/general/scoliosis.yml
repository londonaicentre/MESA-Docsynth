scoliosis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS)
  presenting_complaint: Uneven shoulder height and rib prominence noted during PE.
  summary_of_course: A healthy 13-year-old female presented to her GP with truncal asymmetry. Clinical examination revealed a positive Adam’s forward bend test and a 12-degree Cobb angle on standing spinal radiographs. Managed conservatively in the outpatient clinic with six-monthly monitoring; the curve remained stable throughout puberty.

scoliosis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Progressive Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly worsening spinal curvature and back fatigue.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old male presented with a 35-degree right thoracic curve and Risser grade 1. Despite a rigid bracing programme (Boston brace), the curve progressed to 52 degrees over 12 months. He underwent successful posterior spinal fusion with pedicle screw fixation, resulting in excellent deformity correction.

scoliosis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Congenital Scoliosis
  presenting_complaint: Visible spinal deformity noted at birth.
  summary_of_course: A neonate was referred following the discovery of a rigid mid-thoracic curve. Imaging confirmed a hemi-vertebra at T8 causing a focal 25-degree scoliosis. Following multidisciplinary review, he underwent a hemi-vertebra excision and short-segment fusion at age 3 to prevent severe truncal imbalance.

scoliosis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Neuromuscular Scoliosis secondary to Cerebral Palsy
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty sitting upright in a wheelchair and skin breakdown over the pelvis.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old girl with spastic quadriplegic CP (GMFCS V) presented with a severe 85-degree C-shaped thoracolumbar curve and significant pelvic obliquity. The deformity caused recurrent pressure sores and compromised her sitting balance. She underwent an extensive T2-to-pelvis posterior spinal fusion to restore sagittal and coronal balance.

scoliosis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Degenerative Adult Scoliosis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic lower back pain and neurogenic claudication.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with known osteoporosis presented with progressive spinal leaning and leg pain when walking. MRI demonstrated a 30-degree lumbar scoliosis with multi-level central canal stenosis. She was managed with targeted nerve root blocks and a structured physiotherapy programme for core stability.

scoliosis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Infantile Idiopathic Scoliosis
  presenting_complaint: Left-sided rib hump noted by parents in a 10-month-old.
  summary_of_course: An infant presented with a 15-degree left thoracic curve; MRI of the neuroaxis was normal. Serial Mehta casting was initiated under general anaesthetic to guide growth. After four cycles of casting, the Cobb angle reduced to 4 degrees, and the patient transitioned to a part-time removable orthosis.

scoliosis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Scoliosis secondary to Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1)
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressing, painful spinal deformity.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy with NF1 and multiple café-au-lait spots presented with a sharp, dystrophic 45-degree thoracic curve. Radiographs showed characteristic vertebral scalloping and rib pencilling. Due to the high risk of progression and pseudarthrosis, he underwent early surgical stabilisation with a combined anterior-posterior approach.

scoliosis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening Scoliosis with Respiratory Failure
  presenting_complaint: Severe breathlessness and cyanosis.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with untreated 110-degree thoracic scoliosis presented to A&E in Type 2 respiratory failure (pCO2 8.5 kPa). He was admitted to ICU for non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Pulmonary function tests showed a restrictive pattern with FVC <30% predicted, necessitating long-term nocturnal NIV before considering palliative surgical stabilisation.

scoliosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Scoliosis associated with Syringomyelia
  presenting_complaint: Left-sided thoracic curve and loss of temperature sensation in the hands.
  summary_of_course: An 11-year-old girl presented with an atypical left-sided thoracic scoliosis. Neurological exam revealed dissociated sensory loss, prompting a spinal MRI which identified a large cervicothoracic syrinx and Chiari I malformation. She underwent posterior fossa decompression, after which her scoliosis progression slowed significantly.

scoliosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Early Onset Scoliosis (EOS)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive spinal curvature in a 5-year-old.
  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old female presented with a 40-degree thoracic curve that was non-responsive to bracing. To allow for continued lung development and spinal growth, she had magnetically controlled growing rods (MCGR) inserted. She attends the outpatient clinic every three months for non-invasive rod lengthening using an external remote controller.

scoliosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-traumatic Scoliosis
  presenting_complaint: Back pain and truncal tilt following an old injury.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented with a 22-degree lumbar scoliosis that developed following a malunited L2 burst fracture sustained in a motor vehicle accident ten years prior. The resulting coronal imbalance led to secondary facet joint arthropathy. Management focused on analgesic optimisation and a trial of medial branch blocks.

scoliosis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Scoliosis in Marfan Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Severe tall stature and visible spinal curvature.
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old male with Marfan syndrome and previous aortic root replacement presented with a 65-degree double major curve. Due to connective tissue laxity, the curve was highly flexible but rapidly progressing. He underwent posterior spinal fusion, with intraoperative precautions taken due to his cardiovascular history and dural ectasia.

scoliosis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Functional Scoliosis
  presenting_complaint: Apparent spinal tilt and uneven hips.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old female was referred for suspected AIS. Clinical exam revealed a 2cm leg length discrepancy (LLD) on the right side; the spinal curve resolved completely when the patient sat down or used a temporary shoe lift. She was diagnosed with functional scoliosis secondary to LLD and referred to the orthotics department.

scoliosis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic Scoliosis
  presenting_complaint: Progressive rib prominence following cardiac surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 9-year-old boy presented with a 30-degree right thoracic curve focused at the site of a previous thoracotomy for neonatal coarctation repair. Scar contracture and rib fusion had tethered the hemithorax, leading to an acquired scoliosis. He was managed with serial stretching exercises and monitoring, with surgery reserved for further progression.

scoliosis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Scoliosis in Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI)
  presenting_complaint: Multiple vertebral fractures and severe spinal collapse.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old with Type III OI presented with a complex 75-degree scoliosis and significant kyphosis. The poor bone mineral density made traditional instrumentation challenging. He was treated with bisphosphonates to improve bone quality before undergoing a multi-level fusion with augmented fixation using sublaminar wires.

scoliosis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Adult Idiopathic Scoliosis with Acute Radiculopathy
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of sharp leg pain and foot drop.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old woman with a long-standing, stable 40-degree lumbar scoliosis presented with acute right L5 radiculopathy. MRI showed a disc herniation at the apex of the curve where degenerative changes were most pronounced. She underwent an urgent microdiscectomy, which resolved the neurological deficit, though her scoliosis remained.

scoliosis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Scoliosis with Tethered Cord Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Foot deformity and worsening spinal curve.
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old boy with a 35-degree lumbar scoliosis was noted to have a new-onset cavovarus foot deformity and bladder dysfunction. MRI revealed a low-lying conus medullaris and a thickened filum terminale. He underwent neurosurgical detethering, which stabilised his neurological symptoms and halted the rapid progression of the scoliosis.

scoliosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis with Treatment Failure
  presenting_complaint: Persistent deformity and pain following previous fusion.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female presented with "crankshaft phenomenon" and a 15-degree increase in her rib hump despite having had a posterior fusion at age 11. Imaging confirmed pseudarthrosis and hardware failure at the distal end of the construct. She required a complex revision surgery involving anterior column release and posterior re-instrumentation.

scoliosis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Scoliosis in Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS)
  presenting_complaint: Joint hypermobility and a flexible spinal curve.
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old female with Kyphoscoliotic EDS presented with a 50-degree thoracolumbar curve and severe joint laxity. Surgical planning was complicated by her history of easy bruising and poor wound healing. She underwent fusion with meticulous soft tissue handling and prolonged postoperative bracing to support the fragile connective tissues.

scoliosis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (Psychological Impact)
  presenting_complaint: Significant distress and body image concerns regarding "crooked back".
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old female presented with a 15-degree thoracic scoliosis. While the clinical deformity was mild and did not require bracing or surgery, the patient experienced severe anxiety and social withdrawal. Management involved a combination of orthopaedic reassurance, physiotherapy for posture, and referral to adolescent psychology services.
