constipation_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Functional paediatric constipation
  presenting_complaint: Painful defecation and stool withholding for 2 weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old boy presented with a history of passing hard, "rabbit-dropping" stools once every five days. Examination revealed palpable faecal masses in the left iliac fossa. He was started on a disimpaction regimen of macrogols, followed by a maintenance dose, resulting in the return of regular, soft bowel movements.

constipation_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Stercoral perforation
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset severe abdominal pain and rigors.
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old woman with chronic, poorly managed constipation presented in septic shock with a rigid abdomen. An urgent CT scan showed pneumoperitoneum and a perforated sigmoid colon adjacent to a large faecaloma. She underwent an emergency Hartmann’s procedure and required a prolonged ICU stay for vasopressor support.

constipation_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Opioid-induced constipation (OIC)
  presenting_complaint: No bowel movement for 8 days and worsening abdominal bloating.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old man with metastatic lung cancer was recently titrated onto high-dose oral morphine for bone pain. Despite using stimulant laxatives, he developed severe constipation and abdominal discomfort. He was successfully treated with subcutaneous methylnaltrexone after failing conventional osmotic and stimulant agents.

constipation_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Hirschsprung’s disease
  presenting_complaint: Failure to pass meconium within 48 hours of birth and abdominal distension.
  summary_of_course: A neonate exhibited progressive abdominal swelling and bilious vomiting shortly after birth. Anorectal manometry and a subsequent rectal suction biopsy confirmed an aganglionic segment in the distal colon. The infant underwent a surgical pull-through procedure to bypass the affected segment.

constipation_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Overflow diarrhoea secondary to faecal impaction
  presenting_complaint: Frequent watery stools and urinary incontinence.
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old woman with advanced vascular dementia was brought from her care home with suspected gastroenteritis. Digital rectal examination revealed a large, hard mass of stool in the rectum, indicating that the watery discharge was "overflow" around an impaction. She was treated with glycerine suppositories and manual evacuation under sedation.

constipation_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Obstructing sigmoid colon carcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Absolute constipation, weight loss, and iron deficiency anaemia.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old man reported a three-month history of narrowing stool calibre and progressive constipation, culminating in no flatus or stool for 48 hours. A CT abdomen demonstrated a "napkin-ring" lesion in the sigmoid colon causing a mechanical bowel obstruction. He underwent an emergency colonic stent insertion as a bridge to definitive oncological surgery.

constipation_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Slow transit constipation
  presenting_complaint: Refractory constipation with bowel movements only once every 14 days.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old woman presented with lifelong constipation that failed to respond to high-fibre diets, macrogols, and linaclotide. A Sitz mark radiopaque marker study showed 80% retention of markers at day 5, distributed throughout the colon. She is currently being evaluated for a total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis.

constipation_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Neurogenic bowel dysfunction
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty initiating defecation and severe bloating.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old woman with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis reported worsening bowel symptoms alongside her neurological decline. Investigations confirmed a neurogenic bowel secondary to spinal cord lesions, resulting in slow colonic transit and dyssynergia. Her management was escalated to include a transanal irrigation system, which significantly improved her quality of life.

constipation_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypothyroidism-associated constipation
  presenting_complaint: Lethargy, weight gain, and new-onset constipation.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old woman presented with a six-month history of infrequent bowel movements and cold intolerance. Laboratory tests revealed a TSH of 45 mU/L and low free T4, confirming primary hypothyroidism. Following the initiation of levothyroxine, her metabolic rate improved and her constipation resolved without the need for long-term laxatives.

constipation_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's Syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Massive abdominal distension and mild discomfort.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old man hospitalised with severe pneumonia developed a massively distended, tympanic abdomen. Imaging showed gross dilatation of the caecum and ascending colon without a mechanical blockage. He was managed with intravenous neostigmine and endoscopic decompression to prevent caecal ischaemia.

constipation_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Pregnancy-related constipation
  presenting_complaint: Hard stools and exacerbation of haemorrhoids in the third trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant woman (G1P0) complained of increasing difficulty passing stools since starting iron supplementation for anaemia. Physical examination confirmed external haemorrhoids but no red flags. She was managed conservatively with increased fluid intake, bulk-forming laxatives (ispaghula husk), and topical haemorrhoidal cream.

constipation_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypercalcaemia-induced constipation
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, polyuria, and severe constipation.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old man with known multiple myeloma was admitted with an acute confusional state and a one-week history of no bowel movements. Blood tests showed a corrected calcium of 3.4 mmol/L. His constipation was treated as a secondary symptom of hypercalcaemia, resolving after aggressive intravenous rehydration and bisphosphonate therapy.

constipation_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Laxative abuse secondary to Anorexia Nervosa
  presenting_complaint: Chronic constipation and electrolyte imbalances.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old woman with a low BMI presented with profound weakness and "rebound" constipation when trying to stop stimulant laxatives. She admitted to taking 20 bisacodyl tablets daily for weight control, leading to a "cathartic colon" on imaging. She was referred to an eating disorder specialist and started on a gradual laxative weaning programme.

constipation_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Rectal prolapse secondary to chronic straining
  presenting_complaint: A mass protruding from the anus following bowel movements.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old woman with a 20-year history of chronic constipation and excessive straining reported a painful rectal protrusion. Examination confirmed a full-thickness rectal prolapse. She was treated with a laparoscopic rectopexy and a strict bowel habit retraining programme to prevent recurrence.

constipation_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Drug-induced constipation (Anticholinergics)
  presenting_complaint: New-onset constipation and dry mouth.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old man was started on oxybutynin for urinary urge incontinence. Within two weeks, he developed significant constipation and abdominal fullness. The medication was identified as the causative agent; switching to a more selective agent (mirabegron) and a short course of senna resolved the symptoms.

constipation_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-operative ileus/constipation
  presenting_complaint: Nausea and lack of bowel function 4 days post-laparotomy.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old woman underwent an elective cholecystectomy which was complicated by a prolonged post-operative ileus. She remained nil-by-mouth with a nasogastric tube until bowel sounds returned on day 5. Her constipation was managed with a combination of mobilisation, gum chewing, and gentle osmotic laxatives.

constipation_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Pelvic floor dyssynergia (Type I)
  presenting_complaint: Sensation of incomplete evacuation and the need for digital manoeuvres.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old woman reported that despite having the urge to defecate, she felt "blocked" at the anal level. Anorectal manometry demonstrated paradoxical contraction of the puborectalis muscle during attempted defecation. She was successfully treated with biofeedback therapy to retrain the pelvic floor muscles.

constipation_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic constipation and atopic eczema in an infant.
  summary_of_course: A 10-month-old infant had suffered from hard stools and abdominal pain since weaning onto cow's milk formula. Trials of standard laxatives provided only temporary relief. Following a 4-week elimination diet and switching to an amino acid-based formula, the constipation and skin rash completely resolved.

constipation_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Diverticular-associated constipation
  presenting_complaint: Left-sided abdominal pain and alternating bowel habits.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old man presented with chronic left iliac fossa pain and bouts of constipation. A colonoscopy revealed extensive diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis or malignancy. He was managed with a high-fibre diet and bulk-forming laxatives, which improved his stool consistency and reduced his abdominal discomfort.

constipation_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic megacolon
  presenting_complaint: Massive abdominal girth and chronic constipation since childhood.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old man presented with a history of only 1-2 bowel movements per month. An abdominal X-ray showed a severely dilated colon (diameter >12cm) filled with faeces, but biopsies were negative for Hirschsprung’s. He required regular high-volume enemas and was eventually considered for a subtotal colectomy due to the risk of volvulus.
