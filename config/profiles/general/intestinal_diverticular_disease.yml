  primary_diagnosis: Diverticular stricture with large bowel obstruction
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal distension, obstipation, and vomiting
  summary_of_course: A 71-year-old female presented with acute-on-chronic bowel habit changes and progressive distension. CT imaging showed a high-grade mechanical obstruction at the sigmoid colon caused by a long-segment fibrotic stricture. Following initial decompression with a rectal tube, she underwent an elective sigmoid resection; histology confirmed benign diverticular stricture with no evidence of malignancy.

intestinal_diverticular_disease_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Symptomatic Uncomplicated Diverticular Disease (SUDD)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic recurring LLQ pain and bloating without fever
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented with long-standing, intermittent left-sided abdominal pain often relieved by defecation. Extensive investigations, including colonoscopy and CT, showed diverticulosis but no evidence of acute inflammation or raised inflammatory markers. He was managed with a high-fibre diet and rifaximin, resulting in moderate symptomatic improvement.

intestinal_diverticular_disease_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Perforated Meckel's diverticulitis
  presenting_complaint: Acute periumbilical pain migrating to the right iliac fossa
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old boy presented with signs of localized peritonitis. Laparoscopy for suspected appendicitis revealed a normal appendix but an inflamed, perforated Meckel's diverticulum approximately 50cm from the ileocaecal valve. A small bowel wedge resection was performed, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day four.

intestinal_diverticular_disease_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Segmental Colitis Associated with Diverticulosis (SCAD)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic diarrhoea and haematochezia
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old female underwent colonoscopy for persistent rectal bleeding, which revealed erythematous, friable mucosa confined to the diverticular-bearing segment of the sigmoid colon, sparing the rectum and proximal colon. Histopathology showed features of chronic inflammation similar to IBD. She responded well to a course of oral mesalazine and a high-fibre diet.

intestinal_diverticular_disease_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Giant colonic diverticulum
  presenting_complaint: Large palpable abdominal mass and vague discomfort
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old male was referred following the incidental finding of a 12cm gas-filled structure on a plain abdominal radiograph. CT imaging confirmed a giant sigmoid diverticulum communicating with the colonic lumen. Due to the risk of perforation or volvulus, he underwent an elective sigmoid resection and primary anastomosis.

intestinal_diverticular_disease_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Diverticular haemorrhage with severe anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Lethargy, dyspnoea, and dark maroon stools
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old female living in a care home presented with a haemoglobin of 62 g/L and occult-positive stools. Colonoscopy identified multiple wide-mouthed diverticula in the descending colon with an adherent clot in one, which was treated with endoscopic clip application. She received a two-unit red cell transfusion and remained stable thereafter.

intestinal_diverticular_disease_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Jejunal diverticulitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe mid-abdominal pain and localized tenderness
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male presented with atypical central abdominal pain and a CRP of 150 mg/L. CT imaging revealed multiple small bowel diverticula with localized inflammation and a small amount of extraluminal gas adjacent to a jejunal loop. He was managed successfully with bowel rest and intravenous antibiotics, avoiding the need for small bowel resection.

  primary_diagnosis: Colovaginal fistula
  presenting_complaint: Passage of gas and faecal material per vaginam
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old female, who had previously undergone a total abdominal hysterectomy, presented with distressing vaginal discharge. A water-soluble contrast enema and MRI confirmed a fistula between the sigmoid colon and the vaginal vault, arising from a previous episode of diverticulitis. She was treated with a laparoscopic sigmoid resection and closure of the vaginal defect.

intestinal_diverticular_disease_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute diverticulitis in an immunosuppressed patient
  presenting_complaint: Vague abdominal discomfort and mild tachycardia
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old renal transplant recipient on tacrolimus and prednisolone presented with minimal abdominal signs but a CRP of 210 mg/L. CT imaging revealed a Hinchey III perforated diverticulitis that was clinically masked by her immunosuppression. She underwent an emergency Hartmann's procedure and required a prolonged ICU stay for sepsis management.

intestinal_diverticular_disease_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent diverticulitis with phlegmon
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent LLQ pain and a palpable inflammatory mass
  summary_of_course: A 49-year-old male with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes presented with his fourth flare of diverticulitis in 18 months. CT showed a large inflammatory phlegmon involving the sigmoid and a loop of terminal ileum. Following a 6-week period of "cooling down" with antibiotics, he underwent a complex elective resection requiring a small bowel shave.

intestinal_diverticular_disease_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Diverticular haemorrhage requiring emergency colectomy
  presenting_complaint: Massive, life-threatening rectal haemorrhage
  summary_of_course: A 73-year-old male presented with profound hypotension and ongoing massive haematochezia. Despite multiple attempts at endoscopic haemostasis and unsuccessful selective embolisation due to tortuous anatomy, the bleeding persisted. He underwent an emergency subtotal colectomy and end-ileostomy as a life-saving measure.

intestinal_diverticular_disease_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute diverticulitis with pylephlebitis
  presenting_complaint: Fever, RUQ pain, and jaundice following LLQ pain
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male presented with LLQ pain followed by high swinging fevers and deranged liver function tests. CT imaging confirmed sigmoid diverticulitis complicated by septic thrombophlebitis of the mesenteric and portal veins (pylephlebitis). He was treated with long-term intravenous antibiotics and anticoagulation, leading to gradual resolution of the thrombus.

intestinal_diverticular_disease_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Diverticulitis with ureteric obstruction
  presenting_complaint: Left-sided loin pain and LLQ tenderness
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female presented with what was initially thought to be renal colic. CT imaging revealed acute sigmoid diverticulitis with an associated inflammatory mass causing extrinsic compression of the left ureter and secondary hydronephrosis. A retrograde ureteric stent was placed to relieve the obstruction, followed by conservative management of the diverticulitis.
