thalassaemia_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Beta-thalassaemia major
  presenting_complaint: Severe pallor, poor feeding, and abdominal distension
  summary_of_course: An 8-month-old infant of Pakistani heritage presented with failure to thrive and significant hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory results showed a haemoglobin of 52 g/L and Hb electrophoresis revealed 98% HbF with an absence of HbA. The patient was started on a lifelong regular blood transfusion programme and referred for iron chelation therapy.

thalassaemia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Alpha-plus thalassaemia trait
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic; incidental finding on routine blood count
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male of Cypriot descent underwent health screening for a new job. Results showed a mild microcytic anaemia (Hb 121 g/L, MCV 70 fL) with a normal ferritin level and normal Hb electrophoresis. Genetic testing confirmed an alpha-plus thalassaemia trait (-α/αα), requiring no treatment but necessitating genetic counselling for family planning.

thalassaemia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Haemoglobin H disease
  presenting_complaint: Chronic fatigue, jaundice, and left-sided abdominal fullness
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female of Thai origin presented with moderate haemolytic anaemia (Hb 88 g/L) and splenomegaly. Brilliant cresyl blue staining of the peripheral film showed "golf ball" inclusions in the red cells, confirming HbH disease. She is managed with folic acid supplementation and monitored for acute haemolytic crises during intercurrent infections.

thalassaemia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Beta-thalassaemia intermedia
  presenting_complaint: Chronic, non-healing ulcers on both medial malleoli
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with a known history of Beta-thalassaemia intermedia presented with worsening leg ulcers and exercise intolerance. MRI of the spine identified paraspinal masses consistent with extramedullary haematopoiesis, indicating high erythroid drive. He was started on low-dose hydroxycarbamide and occasional transfusions to suppress erythropoiesis and promote ulcer healing.

thalassaemia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Siderotic cardiomyopathy in Beta-thalassaemia major
  presenting_complaint: Acute shortness of breath and peripheral oedema
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia presented to A&E with signs of congestive heart failure. Cardiac T2* MRI revealed severe myocardial iron loading (T2* 6ms) due to poor adherence to chelation therapy over the preceding three years. She was admitted for intensive intravenous desferrioxamine therapy and heart failure management.

thalassaemia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Hb Bart’s Hydrops Fetalis Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Fetal ascites and severe skin oedema on 22-week ultrasound
  summary_of_course: A routine mid-trimester scan for a couple of Southeast Asian descent revealed significant fetal hydrops and pericardial effusion. Genetic testing confirmed that both parents carried the alpha-zero thalassaemia deletion (--/SEA). The pregnancy resulted in a stillbirth at 27 weeks, confirming the diagnosis of Hb Bart’s where no alpha-globin is produced.

thalassaemia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Beta-thalassaemia minor in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Microcytic anaemia identified at 10-week antenatal booking
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old pregnant woman of Indian background was found to have a haemoglobin of 105 g/L and MCV of 65 fL. Hb electrophoresis confirmed Beta-thalassaemia trait with an HbA2 of 5.5%. Her partner was subsequently screened and found to be a carrier of HbS, identifying a 25% risk of Sickle-Beta thalassaemia in the foetus and requiring urgent referral for prenatal diagnosis.

thalassaemia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Aplastic crisis in Beta-thalassaemia major
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset lethargy and extreme pallor following a febrile illness
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old boy with known Beta-thalassaemia major presented with a precipitous drop in haemoglobin to 32 g/L and a reticulocyte count of <0.1%. Parvovirus B19 PCR returned positive, confirming a transient aplastic crisis. He required urgent top-up transfusions and supportive care until his bone marrow recovered naturally after 10 days.

thalassaemia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Pituitary haemosiderosis in Beta-thalassaemia major
  presenting_complaint: Lack of pubertal development and short stature
  summary_of_course: A 17-year-old male with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia presented with concerns regarding delayed puberty. Clinical assessment confirmed Tanner stage 1 and growth velocity below the 3rd centile, with biochemical evidence of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. This was attributed to pituitary iron deposition from chronic iron overload, necessitating hormone replacement therapy.

thalassaemia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Cholelithiasis in HbH disease
  presenting_complaint: Acute right upper quadrant pain and vomiting
  summary_of_course: A 13-year-old girl with HbH disease presented with biliary colic. Ultrasound confirmed cholecystitis with multiple small pigment gallstones, a common complication of chronic haemolysis in thalassaemia. She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and was counselled on the increased risk of future biliary complications.

thalassaemia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Beta-thalassaemia trait with co-existing iron deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Profound microcytosis and fatigue
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female of Greek descent presented with an MCV of 58 fL and Hb of 82 g/L. Initial suspicion of iron deficiency was confirmed by low ferritin (8 μg/L), but failure to respond to oral iron prompted Hb electrophoresis which revealed a concomitant Beta-thalassaemia trait (HbA2 5.2%). She required intravenous iron before baseline thalassaemic parameters could be accurately reassessed.

thalassaemia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Beta-thalassaemia trait (incidental finding)
  presenting_complaint: Investigation for colorectal cancer screening
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male of Italian descent was investigated for a change in bowel habit. While colonoscopy was unremarkable, his bloods showed a long-standing microcytosis (MCV 62 fL) that had been previously misdiagnosed as iron deficiency for decades. Hb electrophoresis confirmed Beta-thalassaemia trait, which was clinically insignificant for his age but explained his baseline haematological parameters.

thalassaemia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI)
  presenting_complaint: Rapid onset high fever, rigors, and hypotension
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male with Beta-thalassaemia major, who underwent splenectomy ten years prior, presented in septic shock. Despite previous vaccinations, he was diagnosed with OPSI due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. He was managed in the ICU with aggressive fluid resuscitation and intravenous ceftriaxone, highlighting the ongoing infectious risks in asplenic thalassaemic patients.

thalassaemia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary diabetes mellitus due to iron overload
  presenting_complaint: Polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia presented with a fasting plasma glucose of 14.2 mmol/L. Her serum ferritin was significantly elevated at 4500 μg/L, indicating severe iron overload. A diagnosis of secondary diabetes mellitus due to pancreatic haemosiderosis was made, requiring insulin therapy and a change in her chelation regimen.

thalassaemia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Sickle-Beta plus thalassaemia
  presenting_complaint: Severe bone pain in the legs and back
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male of mixed West African and Mediterranean heritage presented with a vaso-occlusive crisis. Blood film showed sickle cells and target cells, and electrophoresis confirmed Sickle-Beta plus thalassaemia (HbS 70%, HbA 20%, HbA2 5%). He was treated with intravenous opioids and hydration, representing a complex compound heterozygous phenotype.

thalassaemia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Red cell alloimmunisation in transfusion-dependent thalassaemia
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty in cross-matching blood for routine transfusion
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old woman with Beta-thalassaemia major who has received over 500 units of blood presented for a scheduled transfusion. The laboratory reported multiple red cell alloantibodies (anti-K, anti-E, and anti-Fya), making it difficult to find compatible units. This complicates her ongoing management, necessitating the use of extended-phenotype matched blood to prevent haemolytic reactions.

thalassaemia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Skeletal deformities from ineffective erythropoiesis
  presenting_complaint: Facial bone expansion and dental malocclusion
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old boy with inadequately transfused Beta-thalassaemia intermedia presented with "chipmunk facies" and maxillary overgrowth. Physical exam showed prominent cheekbones caused by massive erythroid hyperplasia and expansion of the bone marrow cavities. He was transitioned to a regular transfusion programme to suppress ineffective erythropoiesis and prevent further skeletal distortion.

thalassaemia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Haemoglobin H-Constant Spring disease
  presenting_complaint: Mild jaundice, fatigue, and enlarged spleen
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old male of Vietnamese origin was found to have a haemoglobin of 75 g/L and splenomegaly. Genetic analysis revealed he was a compound heterozygote for an alpha-zero deletion and the Hb Constant Spring mutation. This non-deletional variant results in a more severe clinical phenotype than standard HbH disease, requiring closer monitoring for anaemia and iron overload.

thalassaemia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Deferiprone-induced agranulocytosis
  presenting_complaint: High fever, sore throat, and shivering
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old male with transfusion-dependent Beta-thalassaemia major was admitted to the ICU with neutropenic sepsis. He had recently commenced deferiprone for iron chelation, which was identified as the cause of his agranulocytosis (neutrophils 0.1 x 10^9/L). He recovered after cessation of the drug and treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and G-CSF.

thalassaemia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Hepatocellular carcinoma in iron-overload cirrhosis
  presenting_complaint: Right-sided abdominal pain and unintentional weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with Beta-thalassaemia major and chronic Hepatitis C (acquired via transfusion in the 1980s) presented with a new liver mass on ultrasound. Alpha-fetoprotein was significantly elevated, and biopsy confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma on a background of iron-overload induced cirrhosis. He was referred for multidisciplinary oncology management and palliative care.
