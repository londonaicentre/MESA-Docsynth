paraneoplastic_neuromyopathy_neuropathy_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Paraneoplastic sensory neuronopathy (Anti-Hu)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive numbness and painful tingling in all four limbs.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male smoker presented with subacute, asymmetric sensory loss and ataxia. NCS showed absent sensory nerve action potentials with preserved motor conduction. Serum was positive for Anti-Hu antibodies, and a subsequent CT thorax revealed a 2cm hilar mass confirmed as small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). Despite chemotherapy and IVIG, the sensory deficits remained stable but severe.

paraneoplastic_neuromyopathy_neuropathy_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS)
  presenting_complaint: Proximal muscle weakness and dry mouth.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female reported difficulty rising from chairs and climbing stairs, with symptoms improving slightly after exercise. Repetitive nerve stimulation showed a 150% increment in CMAP amplitude post-exercise, and VGCC antibodies were positive. A PET-CT identified occult breast adenocarcinoma. Treatment with 3,4-diaminopyridine and tumour resection led to significant functional improvement.

paraneoplastic_neuromyopathy_neuropathy_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Paraneoplastic dermatomyositis
  presenting_complaint: Heliotrope rash and profound proximal weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old woman presented with a violaceous eyelid rash and inability to lift her arms above her head. CK was elevated at 4500 U/L, and EMG showed myopathic features with fibrillations. Extensive screening identified an underlying stage III ovarian carcinoma. She was treated with high-dose prednisolone and methotrexate alongside oncology-led surgical debulking.

paraneoplastic_neuromyopathy_neuropathy_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute motor neuropathy associated with Hodgkin Lymphoma
  presenting_complaint: Progressive lower limb weakness and foot drop.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male presented with a three-month history of painless, progressive leg weakness. Clinical examination revealed lower motor neurone signs and absent ankle jerks. Lymph node biopsy confirmed Hodgkin lymphoma (nodular sclerosing). The neuropathy partially resolved following ABVD chemotherapy regimen, though some distal weakness persisted.

paraneoplastic_neuromyopathy_neuropathy_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Paraneoplastic autonomic neuropathy (Anti-Hu)
  presenting_complaint: Severe constipation and orthostatic hypotension.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with a history of COPD presented with pseudo-obstruction and recurrent syncope. Autonomic testing confirmed severe sympathetic and parasympathetic failure. Anti-Hu antibodies were detected, and a small-cell lung cancer was located via bronchoscopy. Management focused on palliative chemotherapy and midodrine for blood pressure support, but the patient succumbed to respiratory failure.

paraneoplastic_neuromyopathy_neuropathy_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Paraneoplastic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (Anti-CV2/CRMP5)
  presenting_complaint: Painful burning sensations in feet and progressive gait instability.
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old female presented with a subacute mixed neuropathy and chorea. MRI brain was normal, but Anti-CV2 antibodies were strongly positive. Screening revealed a thymoma. Following thymectomy and plasma exchange, her chorea resolved, but the axonal sensorimotor neuropathy showed only marginal improvement over twelve months.

paraneoplastic_neuromyopathy_neuropathy_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Paraneoplastic necrotising myopathy
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive muscle pain and severe weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male presented with acute-onset proximal weakness and dysphagia. CK was 12,000 U/L, and muscle biopsy showed extensive myofibre necrosis with minimal inflammation. Anti-HMGCR antibodies were negative, but a CT abdomen found a renal cell carcinoma. The patient required ICU admission for ventilatory support before responding to aggressive immunosuppression and nephrectomy.

paraneoplastic_neuromyopathy_neuropathy_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) as a paraneoplastic phenomenon
  presenting_complaint: Relapsing-remitting weakness and sensory loss.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female was initially treated for standard CIDP with corticosteroids. Poor treatment response prompted further investigation, revealing a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and eventually an underlying plasmacytoma. Targeted radiotherapy to the bone lesion led to a sustained neurological remission.

paraneoplastic_neuromyopathy_neuropathy_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Paraneoplastic stiff-person syndrome with neuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Muscle stiffness, spasms, and distal numbness.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old woman presented with truncal rigidity and painful muscle spasms triggered by noise, alongside a distal sensory neuropathy. Anti-amphiphysin antibodies were positive. Mammography identified a small, non-palpable breast carcinoma. Symptoms improved significantly following tumour excision and diazepam therapy.

paraneoplastic_neuromyopathy_neuropathy_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute paraneoplastic axonal neuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly ascending paralysis over 48 hours.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male presented with a clinical picture mimicking Guillain-Barré Syndrome. CSF showed albuminocytologic dissociation, but NCS revealed a non-irritable axonal process. Anti-Hu antibodies were positive, and a CT scan confirmed metastatic SCLC. Despite IVIG, the patient's condition deteriorated, and he was transitioned to palliative care.

paraneoplastic_neuromyopathy_neuropathy_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild paraneoplastic sensory neuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent "pins and needles" in the hands.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male presented with mild, non-disabling paraesthesia. Initial neurological workup was unremarkable except for slightly reduced vibration sense. Due to a significant smoking history, a screening CT was performed, revealing an early-stage squamous cell lung carcinoma. The neuropathy remained stable post-resection without further intervention.

paraneoplastic_neuromyopathy_neuropathy_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Paraneoplastic neuromyotonia (Isaac's Syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Continuous muscle twitching and stiffness.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male presented with widespread myokymia and hyperhidrosis. EMG confirmed continuous muscle fibre activity. Voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC) antibodies (specifically LGI1) were negative, but CASPR2 was positive. A chest CT identified a thymoma. Treatment with plasma exchange and thymectomy resulted in complete resolution of muscle twitching.

paraneoplastic_neuromyopathy_neuropathy_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Paraneoplastic brachial plexopathy
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of severe right shoulder pain followed by weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 57-year-old female presented with symptoms suggestive of Parsonage-Turner syndrome. However, the persistence of pain and progressive involvement of the lower trunk of the plexus led to an MRI, which showed no local infiltration. Further screening identified a contralateral lung nodule (adenocarcinoma). The plexopathy was deemed paraneoplastic and responded moderately to systemic chemotherapy.

paraneoplastic_neuromyopathy_neuropathy_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Paraneoplastic vasculitic neuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Multiple mononeuropathy (mononeuritis multiplex).
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male presented with a right foot drop followed by left wrist drop. Nerve biopsy demonstrated non-systemic necrotising vasculitis. Subsequent PET-CT identified a B-cell lymphoma. The patient was treated with rituximab and cyclophosphamide, resulting in stabilisation of the neurological deficits and haematological remission.

paraneoplastic_neuromyopathy_neuropathy_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute sensory neuronopathy in a patient with multiple comorbidities
  presenting_complaint: Severe ataxia and inability to walk.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with type 2 diabetes and CCF presented with rapidly progressive gait instability. While initially attributed to diabetic neuropathy, the severity and upper limb involvement prompted antibody testing. Anti-Hu was positive, and SCLC was diagnosed. Management was complicated by his frailty, limiting chemotherapy options to palliative radiotherapy.

paraneoplastic_neuromyopathy_neuropathy_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Paraneoplastic polymyositis associated with gastric cancer
  presenting_complaint: Proximal muscle weakness and weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male presented with a six-month history of progressive weakness and 15kg weight loss. CK was 2000 U/L. Gastroscopy performed for unintentional weight loss revealed a gastric adenocarcinoma. Following total gastrectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy, his muscle strength returned to baseline without the need for long-term steroids.

paraneoplastic_neuromyopathy_neuropathy_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory LEMS with respiratory failure
  presenting_complaint: Severe shortness of breath and limb weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female with known SCLC developed life-threatening respiratory muscle weakness. Despite high-dose IVIG, 3,4-diaminopyridine, and plasma exchange, she remained ventilator-dependent in the ICU. The paraneoplastic process was refractory to both neurological and oncological treatments, and she eventually died from ventilator-associated pneumonia.

paraneoplastic_neuromyopathy_neuropathy_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Paraneoplastic sensory-predominant polyneuropathy (Anti-Ri)
  presenting_complaint: Loss of coordination and numbness in the fingers.
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old woman presented with sensory ataxia and opsoclonus. Anti-Ri antibodies were detected. Screening revealed a small primary breast tumour. After lumpectomy and radiotherapy, the opsoclonus resolved, but she was left with a permanent, moderate sensory neuropathy affecting her fine motor skills.

paraneoplastic_neuromyopathy_neuropathy_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic paraneoplastic neuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of pre-existing mild leg weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old male with a stable, low-grade neuropathy for two years suddenly lost the ability to ambulate. Repeat imaging showed progression of previously treated prostate cancer with new bone metastases. The neurological decline was attributed to an escalating paraneoplastic immune response, which partially responded to a pulse of methylprednisolone.

paraneoplastic_neuromyopathy_neuropathy_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Paraneoplastic neuromyopathy (Anti-Yo)
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty walking and generalized muscle aching.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female presented with a combination of cerebellar ataxia and proximal muscle weakness. While Anti-Yo is typically associated with cerebellar degeneration, muscle biopsy also showed myopathic changes. An occult adnexal mass was found on ultrasound, confirmed as fallopian tube carcinoma. Surgical resection led to stabilisation of her symptoms but no significant recovery of function.
