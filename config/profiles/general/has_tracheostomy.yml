  presenting_complaint: Massive, pulsatile haemorrhage from the tracheostomy stoma.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male, three weeks post-tracheostomy, presented with a sudden "sentinel bleed" followed by catastrophic haemorrhage. Hyperinflation of the cuff provided temporary tamponade while he was rushed to theatre. The fistula was repaired via a median sternotomy, but the patient remains in a critical condition in ICU.
