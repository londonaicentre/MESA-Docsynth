joint_effusion_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Haemophilic arthropathy
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent spontaneous swelling and stiffness in the right ankle
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy with severe Haemophilia A presented with a chronic joint effusion and reduced joint space on X-ray. Despite prophylactic Factor VIII replacement, he suffered frequent breakthrough bleeds. He required a multidisciplinary approach involving haematology and orthopaedics for synovectomy to prevent further joint destruction.

joint_effusion_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Lyme arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Large, relatively painless swelling of the left knee
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old girl presented with a massive, subacute joint effusion 4 months after a camping trip in the New Forest. Borrelia burgdorferi serology was strongly positive (IgG). She completed a 28-day course of oral doxycycline, which led to the gradual resolution of the effusion over several weeks.
