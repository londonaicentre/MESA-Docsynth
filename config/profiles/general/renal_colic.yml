  primary_diagnosis: Renal colic mimicking acute appendicitis
  presenting_complaint: Right iliac fossa pain and nausea.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male presented with migratory pain to the right iliac fossa, initially suspected to be appendicitis. Inflammatory markers were normal, and a CT abdomen/pelvis identified a 4mm stone at the right vesicoureteric junction rather than appendiceal inflammation. Symptoms resolved following spontaneous stone passage in the ED.

renal_colic_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Bilateral renal colic
  presenting_complaint: Severe bilateral loin pain and rapidly rising urea.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with a history of gout presented with excruciating bilateral flank pain. Imaging showed bilateral ureteric stones (5mm and 6mm) causing bilateral hydronephrosis and acute kidney injury (Stage 3). He required bilateral ureteric stenting and intensive fluid resuscitation.

renal_colic_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Renal colic with gross haematuria and clot colic
  presenting_complaint: Severe left loin pain and passage of large blood clots in urine.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male on warfarin for atrial fibrillation presented with renal colic-like pain. CT KUB showed a 5mm renal stone, but the primary cause of acute colic was the passage of organized blood clots (clot colic) down the ureter. Anticoagulation was reversed, and he was managed with bladder irrigation and analgesia.

renal_colic_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Staghorn calculus with subacute colic
  presenting_complaint: Persistent dull ache in the left flank and recurrent UTIs.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old female presented with a three-month history of subacute left-sided discomfort. Plain film X-ray and CT showed a large struvite staghorn calculus filling the renal pelvis. She underwent a staged PCNL after a course of culture-specific antibiotics for Proteus mirabilis infection.
