polymyositis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Polymyositis
  presenting_complaint: Progressive proximal muscle weakness and difficulty climbing stairs.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old woman presented with a 3-month history of bilateral hip and shoulder girdle weakness. Investigations revealed a serum creatine kinase (CK) of 4,500 U/L and an electromyogram (EMG) showing irritable myopathic features. Muscle biopsy confirmed endomysial inflammatory infiltrates, leading to a diagnosis of polymyositis. She responded well to high-dose oral prednisolone and methotrexate, with CK levels normalising within 6 months.

polymyositis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute severe polymyositis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of profound weakness and dysphagia.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male was admitted via A&E with acute-onset inability to stand and difficulty swallowing. He required ICU admission for ventilatory support due to respiratory muscle involvement and aspiration risk. CK was markedly elevated at 12,000 U/L. Following intravenous methylprednisolone and IVIG, his bulbar symptoms improved, though he required a prolonged period of neuro-physiotherapy for motor recovery.

polymyositis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Paraneoplastic polymyositis
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss, lethargy, and mild proximal limb weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female smoker presented with subacute weakness and 10kg weight loss. While muscle biopsy was consistent with polymyositis (anti-Jo-1 negative), further screening with a CT chest/abdomen/pelvis identified an underlying bronchogenic carcinoma. The myositis was managed with steroids, but her overall prognosis remained guarded due to the advanced stage of the malignancy.

polymyositis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Juvenile polymyositis
  presenting_complaint: Refusal to walk and generalized muscle pain.
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old boy presented with a 4-week history of progressive leg pain and inability to keep up with peers during PE. Clinical examination showed significant Gowers' sign and proximal tenderness without the heliotrope rash of dermatomyositis. MRI of the thighs showed diffuse muscle oedema, and he was started on a paediatric regimen of prednisolone and subcutaneous methotrexate with good functional recovery.

polymyositis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic refractory polymyositis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent weakness despite long-term immunosuppression.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old woman with a 5-year history of polymyositis presented with a gradual decline in mobility. She had previously failed trials of azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil due to liver function abnormalities and persistent CK elevations. She was commenced on rituximab infusions, which led to a significant improvement in her manual muscle testing scores and a reduction in her daily steroid requirement.

polymyositis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic polymyositis flare
  presenting_complaint: Rapid worsening of muscle strength following a viral illness.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with stable polymyositis on maintenance azathioprine presented with a sudden "crash" in strength two weeks after a flu-like prodrome. His CK, which had been stable at 200 U/L, spiked to 3,500 U/L. He was treated with a temporary increase in prednisolone dose and a switch from azathioprine to mycophenolate mofetil, resulting in stabilization of his condition.

polymyositis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Polymyositis-associated Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath on exertion and dry cough.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old woman presented with exertional dyspnoea and mild proximal weakness. High-resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest showed non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) patterns, and serology was positive for anti-PL-7 antibodies. She was diagnosed with polymyositis with pulmonary involvement and treated aggressively with cyclophosphamide followed by mycophenolate, showing stabilization of her lung function tests.

polymyositis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Polymyositis with cardiac involvement
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations, chest tightness, and proximal weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with biopsy-proven polymyositis developed new-onset atrial fibrillation and signs of heart failure. Cardiac MRI revealed patchy late gadolinium enhancement consistent with myocarditis. His immunosuppressive regimen was intensified with the addition of tacrolimus, and he was managed by a joint cardio-rheumatology team for his complex inflammatory cardiomyopathy.

polymyositis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: CK-negative polymyositis
  presenting_complaint: Progressive weakness but normal blood tests.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female presented with classic proximal weakness but repeatedly normal CK and ESR levels. Despite the normal biochemistry, MRI STIR sequences showed significant muscle inflammation in the vastus lateralis. A targeted muscle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of polymyositis, highlighting the diagnostic challenge of normal enzyme levels in active disease.

polymyositis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Postpartum polymyositis
  presenting_complaint: Severe weakness 6 weeks after childbirth.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old woman developed rapid-onset proximal weakness shortly after the birth of her first child. Initially attributed to postnatal exhaustion, her condition worsened until she could not lift her infant. Investigations showed a CK of 6,000 U/L and positive anti-SRP antibodies, indicating a more aggressive necrotising variant of polymyositis, requiring intensive IVIG and steroid therapy.

polymyositis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Polymyositis (Diagnostic Challenge)
  presenting_complaint: Asymmetric leg weakness and frequent falls.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male presented with asymmetric quadriceps weakness, initially raising suspicion of inclusion body myositis (IBM). However, muscle biopsy lacked rimmed vacuoles and instead showed prominent MHC-I upregulation and endomysial T-cell invasion. He was treated for polymyositis with high-dose steroids and showed a partial but significant clinical response, unlike the typical steroid-resistance seen in IBM.

polymyositis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Scleromyositis (Overlap Syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Skin tightening and profound muscle aches.
  summary_of_course: A 53-year-old woman with known systemic sclerosis presented with new, severe proximal muscle weakness and a CK of 2,800 U/L. Serology was positive for anti-PM/Scl antibodies. This overlap syndrome was managed with a cautious steroid taper to avoid scleroderma renal crisis, alongside mycophenolate mofetil, which addressed both her cutaneous and muscular symptoms.

polymyositis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Bulbar-predominant polymyositis
  presenting_complaint: Choking on liquids and nasal regurgitation.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male presented primarily with oropharyngeal dysphagia and a weak voice (dysphonia). While limb weakness was mild, videofluoroscopy confirmed severe pharyngeal dysfunction. Biopsy of the deltoid confirmed polymyositis, and he required a temporary nasogastric tube for nutrition while high-dose immunosuppression took effect.

polymyositis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild outpatient polymyositis
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty rising from a low chair and fatigue.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old man noted a slow decline in his ability to perform squats at the gym over 6 months. CK was mildly elevated at 800 U/L, and EMG was mildly myopathic. He was diagnosed with a mild form of polymyositis and successfully managed in the outpatient clinic with low-dose prednisolone and methotrexate, returning to full physical activity within a year.

polymyositis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Polymyositis with multi-morbidity
  presenting_complaint: Weakness in a patient with Type 2 diabetes and obesity.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old woman with poorly controlled diabetes presented with proximal weakness. The diagnosis of polymyositis was complicated by the need to avoid high-dose steroids due to the risk of hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state. She was instead started on a steroid-sparing-first approach with early IVIG and mycophenolate, achieving disease control without destabilising her glycaemic status.

polymyositis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory polymyositis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent flares and steroid dependency.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male had suffered four relapses of polymyositis over three years whenever his prednisolone dose dropped below 15mg. Despite being on azathioprine, his disease remained active. He was eventually transitioned to rituximab, which allowed for a successful steroid taper and long-term remission, though he required regular immunoglobulin monitoring due to secondary hypogammaglobulinaemia.

polymyositis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute polymyositis
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive weakness over three weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old university student presented with a rapid loss of motor function, becoming unable to walk to lectures within 21 days. CK was 9,000 U/L. Given the acuity, he received pulsed methylprednisolone and was started on methotrexate early; he made a full recovery and was able to sit his end-of-year exams.

polymyositis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Polymyositis with Raynaud's phenomenon
  presenting_complaint: Cold, blue fingers and aching thighs.
  summary_of_course: A 56-year-old male manual labourer presented with Raynaud's phenomenon and progressive difficulty lifting tools above his head. Investigations confirmed polymyositis with positive anti-Jo-1 antibodies. He was managed with nifedipine for his vasospasm and a combination of prednisolone and azathioprine for the myositis, allowing him to return to modified duties at work.

polymyositis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Polymyositis with severe myalgia
  presenting_complaint: Intense muscle pain and tenderness.
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old woman presented with muscle pain so severe it mimicked fibromyalgia. However, the presence of objective weakness on testing and a CK of 3,200 U/L prompted a biopsy, which showed significant myofibre necrosis and inflammatory infiltration. Her pain and weakness responded dramatically to corticosteroid therapy, confirming the inflammatory nature of her symptoms.

polymyositis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute polymyositis
  presenting_complaint: Generalised malaise followed by proximal limb weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old female presented with a 2-month history of feeling "unwell" before noticing she could no longer brush her hair without her arms aching. Examination showed 4/5 strength in the deltoids and iliopsoas. Biopsy-confirmed polymyositis was treated with a standard tapering course of steroids and azathioprine, resulting in a return to baseline strength within 9 months.
