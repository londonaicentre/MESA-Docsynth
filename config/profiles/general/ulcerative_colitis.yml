  presenting_complaint: Intermittent rectal bleeding and tenesmus.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female presented to her GP with a 3-month history of bright red blood per rectum and mucus. Flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed confluent erythema and loss of vascular pattern limited to the distal 10cm of the rectum. She was started on topical Mesalazine suppositories 1g daily, resulting in complete symptomatic remission within four weeks.

ulcerative_colitis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Acute Ulcerative Colitis
  presenting_complaint: Bloody diarrhoea (12 episodes/day) and abdominal pain.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old male was admitted via A&E with a Truelove and Witts score of severe (tachycardic, CRP 85 mg/L, Hb 102 g/L). Flexible sigmoidoscopy confirmed extensive ulceration consistent with Mayo Grade 3 colitis. He was treated with IV Hydrocortisone 100mg QDS and prophylactic Dalteparin, showing a good clinical response by day 3 without requiring rescue therapy.

ulcerative_colitis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Refractory Pancolitis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent loose stools and significant weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with a 10-year history of pancolitis failed to maintain remission on Azathioprine and Adalimumab. Recent colonoscopy showed persistent moderate activity throughout the colon despite therapeutic drug monitoring. She has now been commenced on Ustekinumab 6mg/kg IV induction with a planned transition to subcutaneous maintenance dosing.

ulcerative_colitis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Toxic Megacolon complicating Ulcerative Colitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal distension, fever, and lethargy.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with known UC presented with systemic toxicity and a dilated transverse colon (7.5cm) on abdominal X-ray. Despite intensive medical management with IV steroids and Ciclosporin, he developed signs of peritonism. He underwent an emergency subtotal colectomy and end ileostomy; histopathology confirmed fulminant colitis with transmural thinning.

ulcerative_colitis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis (VEO-IBD)
  presenting_complaint: Failure to thrive and nocturnal diarrhoea.
  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old boy presented with poor height velocity and chronic bloody stools. Investigations revealed a faecal calprotectin of 1800 µg/g and hypoalbuminaemia. He was diagnosed with pancolitis and commenced on oral Prednisolone weaning and Mesalazine granules, with subsequent introduction of Infliximab due to steroid dependence.

ulcerative_colitis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Ulcerative Colitis with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC)
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic elevation of liver function tests.
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old male with long-standing, quiescent UC was found to have a cholestatic LFT pattern (ALP 450 U/L). MRCP demonstrated characteristic "beading" of the intrahepatic bile ducts consistent with PSC. Due to the significantly increased risk of colorectal neoplasia, he has been enrolled in an annual surveillance colonoscopy programme.

ulcerative_colitis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic Ulcerative Colitis triggered by C. difficile
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of diarrhoea and foul-smelling stools.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old female on maintenance Mesalazine for left-sided UC presented with a sudden flare after a course of antibiotics for a UTI. Stool PCR was positive for Clostridioides difficile toxin. She required admission for IV fluids, Vancomycin, and a temporary increase in her UC maintenance therapy to regain control.

ulcerative_colitis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Left-sided Ulcerative Colitis with Extraintestinal Manifestations
  presenting_complaint: Bloody diarrhoea associated with painful skin nodules and red eyes.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female presented with a moderate UC flare accompanied by erythema nodosum on her shins and bilateral episcleritis. Colonoscopy confirmed active inflammation to the splenic flexure. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids resolved both the gastrointestinal symptoms and the extraintestinal manifestations concurrently.

ulcerative_colitis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Steroid-Refractory Ulcerative Colitis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent bloody diarrhoea despite high-dose oral steroids.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male failed to respond to 40mg Prednisolone over three weeks for a moderate flare. He was admitted for IV Methylprednisolone but remained symptomatic with a CRP of 60 mg/L on day 3. He successfully commenced rescue therapy with Infliximab (5mg/kg), achieving clinical response within 48 hours.

ulcerative_colitis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Ulcerative Colitis in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Increased stool frequency during the second trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant woman (22 weeks gestation) experienced a relapse of her known UC. Following multidisciplinary review, she was started on oral Budesonide (MMX) to minimise systemic steroid exposure. Her symptoms stabilised, and she continued maintenance Mesalazine throughout the remainder of her pregnancy with no adverse foetal outcomes.

ulcerative_colitis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Elderly-Onset Ulcerative Colitis
  presenting_complaint: New onset rectal bleeding and tenesmus in an 82-year-old.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including heart failure and CKD, presented with fresh PR bleeding. Initial concerns for ischaemic colitis or malignancy were ruled out by colonoscopy and biopsy, which showed chronic architectural changes of UC. He was managed cautiously with low-dose Mesalazine to avoid polypharmacy complications.

ulcerative_colitis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Ulcerative Colitis with Pyoderma Gangrenosum
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly enlarging, painful pretibial ulcer.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male with previously undiagnosed bowel symptoms presented to dermatology with a necrotic ulcer showing undermined violaceous edges. GI referral and subsequent flexible sigmoidoscopy confirmed underlying active ulcerative colitis. The skin lesion and colitis both responded dramatically to the initiation of Infliximab and wound care.

ulcerative_colitis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Active Ulcerative Colitis with Mesalazine Intolerance
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal pain and diarrhoea with worsening rash.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female diagnosed with UC developed a widespread maculopapular rash and drug-induced pancreatitis shortly after starting Mesalazine. Mesalazine was discontinued, and she was successfully transitioned to Thiopurine monotherapy (Azathioprine) after checking TPMT levels. She has remained in clinical remission for 18 months on this regimen.

ulcerative_colitis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Ulcerative Colitis with High-Grade Dysplasia
  presenting_complaint: Routine surveillance colonoscopy findings.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with a 20-year history of extensive UC underwent surveillance colonoscopy using chromoendoscopy. Biopsies from a non-visible lesion in the descending colon revealed high-grade dysplasia. Following MDT discussion, he elected for a restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA).

ulcerative_colitis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Ulcerative Colitis with Venous Thromboembolism
  presenting_complaint: Left calf swelling and pleuritic chest pain during a UC flare.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old female admitted with a severe UC flare developed a DVT and segmental pulmonary embolism despite standard prophylaxis. Her UC was managed with IV steroids and Infliximab, while her VTE required therapeutic anticoagulation. This case highlights the prothrombotic state associated with active colonic inflammation.

ulcerative_colitis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Pouchitis post-IPAA for Ulcerative Colitis
  presenting_complaint: Increased frequency and urgency 2 years post-surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old male who had previously undergone a proctocolectomy for UC presented with "pouchitis" symptoms. Pouchoscopy showed inflammation of the ileal reservoir mucosa with histological confirmation. He responded well to a 2-week course of Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole, followed by VSL#3 probiotic supplementation.

ulcerative_colitis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Fulminant Ulcerative Colitis requiring Ciclosporin salvage
  presenting_complaint: 15+ bloody stools per day and severe anaemia.
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old male was admitted with fulminant pancolitis and failed to respond to 5 days of IV Methylprednisolone and two doses of Infliximab. As a final attempt at medical rescue, he was started on IV Ciclosporin with close monitoring of trough levels. He achieved clinical improvement, avoiding an emergency colectomy, and was bridged to Vedolizumab.

ulcerative_colitis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Ulcerative Colitis presenting as Iron Deficiency Anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Lethargy and shortness of breath on exertion.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male presented with profound anaemia (Hb 72 g/L) and microcytosis. He denied significant GI symptoms other than occasional soft stools. Colonoscopy revealed mild but extensive continuous inflammation from the rectum to the mid-transverse colon, confirming UC as the source of chronic occult blood loss.

ulcerative_colitis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate Left-sided Ulcerative Colitis
  presenting_complaint: Crampy left-sided abdominal pain and bloody stools.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old teacher presented with a 6-week history of worsening symptoms. Faecal calprotectin was 950 µg/g. She was started on high-dose oral Mesalazine (4g/day) combined with a 4-week course of Mesalazine enemas, which successfully induced remission without the need for systemic steroids.

ulcerative_colitis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Ulcerative Colitis with Seronegative Spondyloarthropathy
  presenting_complaint: Lower back stiffness and inflammatory bowel symptoms.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male with known UC presented with worsening morning back stiffness and sacroiliac joint tenderness. MRI confirmed sacroiliitis, consistent with an associated seronegative spondyloarthropathy (Type 2). His treatment was escalated to Infliximab, which effectively managed both his axial skeletal symptoms and his colonic inflammation.
