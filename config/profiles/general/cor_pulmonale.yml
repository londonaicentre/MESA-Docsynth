  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Cor Pulmonale with Cardiorenal Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Refractory oedema and rising creatinine.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with severe COPD and chronic cor pulmonale presented with gross fluid overload and acute kidney injury (Type 2 cardiorenal syndrome). Management was challenging due to the balance between diuresis for heart failure and maintaining renal perfusion. He required a period of slow continuous ultrafiltration in the high dependency unit to achieve euvolaemia, followed by a transition back to oral diuretics.

cor_pulmonale_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic Cor Pulmonale (Early Stage)
  presenting_complaint: Routine follow-up for mild COPD.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with mild COPD (FEV1 75% predicted) underwent a screening echocardiogram as part of a clinical trial. The scan incidentally showed mild right ventricular hypertrophy and a PASP of 35 mmHg, despite the patient being asymptomatic for heart failure. He was advised on smoking cessation and pulmonary rehabilitation to prevent progression, with no immediate requirement for diuretic therapy.
