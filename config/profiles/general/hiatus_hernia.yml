  primary_diagnosis: Hiatus hernia mimicking myocardial infarction
  presenting_complaint: Acute central chest pain radiating to the left arm
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male was admitted via ambulance to the cardiac chest pain clinic. Serial troponins and ECGs were normal, but symptoms persisted after meals. A subsequent OGD revealed a large sliding hiatus hernia with severe reflux, and his "angina" was successfully treated with aggressive acid suppression.

hiatus_hernia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Hiatus hernia with aspiration pneumonia
  presenting_complaint: Productive cough, fever, and pleuritic chest pain
  summary_of_course: An 84-year-old female with known dementia and a large hiatus hernia was admitted with sepsis. Chest X-ray confirmed right lower lobe consolidation, suspected to be secondary to nocturnal aspiration of gastric contents. She was treated with intravenous antibiotics and placed on a semi-recumbent sleeping regimen to mitigate further reflux.

hiatus_hernia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent hiatus hernia post-fundoplication
  presenting_complaint: Return of severe heartburn and new-onset dysphagia
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female who underwent a Nissen fundoplication five years ago presented with a recurrence of symptoms. A contrast swallow study showed the fundoplication wrap had migrated into the chest along with a recurrent hernia. She underwent a complex re-do laparoscopic hiatal repair and Toupet (partial) fundoplication with good functional results.

hiatus_hernia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Extra-oesophageal hiatus hernia presentation
  presenting_complaint: Chronic dry cough and hoarseness for 12 months
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old non-smoking male was referred by ENT after laryngoscopy showed posterior glottic redness. 24-hour pH monitoring and manometry confirmed significant proximal reflux episodes associated with a small sliding hiatus hernia. His cough improved significantly following a 12-week course of twice-daily PPI therapy and Gaviscon Advance.

hiatus_hernia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Strangulated hiatus hernia
  presenting_complaint: Severe epigastric pain, haematemesis, and signs of shock
  summary_of_course: A 76-year-old male presented in extremis with signs of peritonitis. Emergency CT showed a strangulated para-oesophageal hernia with evidence of gastric wall ischaemia. He underwent an emergency laparotomy, resection of ischaemic gastric tissue, and hiatal closure, requiring a prolonged stay in the ICU post-operatively.

hiatus_hernia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Hiatus hernia with Barrett's oesophagus
  presenting_complaint: Long-term history of mild indigestion and water brash
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old female with a 20-year history of hiatus hernia underwent routine surveillance OGD. Biopsies of a 3cm segment of salmon-coloured mucosa confirmed Barrett's oesophagus with no dysplasia. She remains on lifelong PPI therapy and a 3-yearly endoscopic surveillance programme.

hiatus_hernia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Hiatus hernia with peptic stricture
  presenting_complaint: Progressive dysphagia to solid foods
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male presented with food bolus obstruction episodes. OGD revealed a 4cm hiatus hernia and a benign-appearing stricture at the gastro-oesophageal junction. The stricture was dilated endoscopically, and he was commenced on high-dose Lansoprazole to prevent recurrence of the fibrosis.

hiatus_hernia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Exercise-induced sliding hiatus hernia
  presenting_complaint: Heartburn and chest tightness only during heavy lifting
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male powerlifter reported severe reflux symptoms exclusively during training. A dynamic barium study showed a sliding hiatus hernia that appeared only during the Valsalva manoeuvre. He was managed with pre-workout H2-receptor antagonists and modifications to his breathing technique during lifts.

hiatus_hernia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Incidental hiatus hernia
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic; found during investigation for pulmonary embolism
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old female underwent a CT pulmonary angiogram for suspected PE, which was negative. The scan incidentally noted a moderate-sized type I hiatus hernia. As she was entirely asymptomatic and had no evidence of anaemia, no specific treatment was initiated, following a "watch and wait" approach.

hiatus_hernia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Sliding hiatus hernia with Grade D oesophagitis
  presenting_complaint: Odynophagia and severe retrosternal pain
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male smoker presented with painful swallowing. OGD showed a sliding hiatus hernia and circumferential mucosal breaks (LA Grade D oesophagitis). He was treated with an 8-week course of BD PPIs, smoking cessation support, and a follow-up OGD to ensure mucosal healing and exclude underlying malignancy.

hiatus_hernia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Hiatus hernia with refractory GERD
  presenting_complaint: Persistent reflux despite maximum dose PPI therapy
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female remained symptomatic on Esomeprazole 40mg BD. OGD confirmed a moderate hiatus hernia, but pH-impedance studies showed non-acid reflux episodes correlating with symptoms. She was referred for laparoscopic fundoplication as a definitive treatment for her volume reflux, which provided complete symptom relief.

hiatus_hernia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Hiatus hernia presenting as globus sensation
  presenting_complaint: Persistent feeling of a "lump in the throat"
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female was referred to ENT for globus hystericus. After a clear nasendoscopy, she was referred to GI where an OGD identified a small sliding hiatus hernia and mild oesophagitis. Treatment with a PPI and lifestyle modifications for reflux led to the resolution of the globus sensation within 4 weeks.

hiatus_hernia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Perforated hiatus hernia
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset chest pain and surgical emphysema in the neck
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with a known large hiatus hernia presented after a period of forceful vomiting. Imaging confirmed a perforated intrathoracic stomach (Boerhaave-like presentation within the hernia sac) leading to mediastinitis. He required emergency thoracotomy, debridement, and repair of the gastric perforation, followed by a complex recovery in the ICU.

hiatus_hernia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Large hiatus hernia with delayed gastric emptying
  presenting_complaint: Early satiety, bloating, and post-prandial nausea
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old female presented with significant weight loss due to an inability to finish meals. A gastric emptying study showed delayed transit, and a barium swallow confirmed a large hiatus hernia causing a "kink" at the hiatus. Following elective laparoscopic repair and crural reinforcement, her appetite and meal tolerance returned to baseline.
