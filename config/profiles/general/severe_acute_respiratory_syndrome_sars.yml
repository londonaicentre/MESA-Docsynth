He remained haemodynamically stable and was discharged after a 48-hour observation period.

severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_sars_005:
  primary_diagnosis: severe acute respiratory syndrome with gastrointestinal features
  presenting_complaint: profuse watery diarrhoea followed by respiratory distress
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male initially presented with significant diarrhoea (8-10 episodes/day) before developing a non-productive cough on day 4. Stool samples were positive for SARS-CoV RNA via RT-PCR. He required hospitalisation for dehydration and moderate pneumonia, responding well to fluid resuscitation and ribavirin.

severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_sars_006:
  primary_diagnosis: severe acute respiratory syndrome in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: acute breathlessness and persistent pyrexia
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old woman at 26 weeks gestation presented with tachypnoea and hypoxia (SpO2 88% on room air). Chest CT showed extensive ground-glass opacities. Due to maternal respiratory compromise, she was admitted to the ICU for high-flow nasal oxygen; fetal monitoring remained reassuring, and she was eventually stabilised without early delivery.

severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_sars_007:
  primary_diagnosis: severe acute respiratory syndrome with pulmonary fibrosis
  presenting_complaint: chronic exertional dyspnoea following acute infection
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male survived a severe bout of SARS requiring three weeks of ventilation. Three months post-discharge, he reported persistent breathlessness; high-resolution CT (HRCT) demonstrated significant interstitial thickening and traction bronchiectasis. He was commenced on long-term oxygen therapy and referred for pulmonary rehabilitation.

severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_sars_008:
  primary_diagnosis: severe acute respiratory syndrome with secondary bacterial pneumonia
  presenting_complaint: sudden worsening of cough and purulent sputum
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old patient initially stabilised after a SARS diagnosis but suffered a secondary clinical deterioration on day 10. Sputum cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus, and inflammatory markers (CRP 250 mg/L) rose sharply. Treatment was escalated to include intravenous vancomycin, leading to gradual recovery.

severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_sars_009:
  primary_diagnosis: severe acute respiratory syndrome (atypical presentation)
  presenting_complaint: confusion and falls in an elderly patient
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old female with dementia presented with acute confusion and a single fall. She was afebrile on admission, but routine screening revealed lymphopenia (0.5 x 10^9/L) and bilateral basal shadowing on X-ray. SARS-CoV-1 was confirmed via nasopharyngeal swab, highlighting the lack of classic febrile prodrome in the elderly.

severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_sars_010:
  primary_diagnosis: severe acute respiratory syndrome with acute kidney injury (AKI)
  presenting_complaint: oliguria and severe breathlessness
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male with no prior history developed SARS-associated ARDS. On day 7, his creatinine rose from 80 to 450 µmol/L alongside worsening metabolic acidosis. He required continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVH) in the ICU for two weeks before renal function began to recover.

severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_sars_011:
  primary_diagnosis: severe acute respiratory syndrome (nosocomial)
  presenting_complaint: new onset fever and cough in a post-operative patient
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male recovering from elective hip arthroplasty developed a temperature of 39.0°C. Initially suspected to be a post-operative complication, his contact with an undiagnosed SARS patient in the ward led to testing. Despite aggressive treatment, his frailty contributed to a rapid decline and death from respiratory failure.

severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_sars_012:
  primary_diagnosis: severe acute respiratory syndrome with steroid-induced complications
  presenting_complaint: hip pain six months after SARS recovery
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male was treated for life-threatening SARS with high-dose methylprednisolone. During follow-up, he complained of progressive bilateral groin pain. MRI confirmed avascular necrosis of the femoral heads, a known sequela of the pulsed steroid therapy used during the SARS outbreak.

severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_sars_013:
  primary_diagnosis: severe acute respiratory syndrome (subacute presentation)
  presenting_complaint: persistent low-grade fever and dry cough for 10 days
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old female presented with a prolonged prodromal phase of mild symptoms before suddenly deteriorating on day 11 with severe hypoxia. This "biphasic" pattern was confirmed with worsening radiological infiltrates during the second week. She required non-invasive ventilation (CPAP) for 5 days before improving.

severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_sars_014:
  primary_diagnosis: severe acute respiratory syndrome with myocarditis
  presenting_complaint: chest pain and palpitations
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old female with SARS developed new-onset sinus tachycardia and ST-segment changes on ECG. Troponin T was significantly elevated at 450 ng/L. Echocardiography showed a reduced ejection fraction of 40% and global hypokinesis, consistent with viral myocarditis; she was managed with ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers.

  primary_diagnosis: severe acute respiratory syndrome in an immunocompromised host
  presenting_complaint: persistent fever and worsening fatigue
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male undergoing chemotherapy for lymphoma contracted SARS. He exhibited prolonged viral shedding, with RT-PCR remaining positive for over 6 weeks. His clinical course was marked by profound lymphopenia and slow radiological resolution, requiring extended isolation and multiple courses of antiviral therapy.

severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_sars_016:
  primary_diagnosis: severe acute respiratory syndrome with hepatic involvement
  presenting_complaint: fever, cough, and yellowish discolouration of eyes
  summary_of_course: A 47-year-old male presented with standard SARS symptoms but was found to have significantly deranged liver function tests (ALT 800 U/L, Bilirubin 45 µmol/L). Viral hepatitis screen was negative. The transaminitis was attributed to direct SARS-CoV-1 effect or drug-induced liver injury from ribavirin, resolving once the acute infection subsided.

severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_sars_017:
  primary_diagnosis: severe acute respiratory syndrome (treatment failure)
  presenting_complaint: refractory hypoxia despite maximal medical therapy
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male was treated with ribavirin, corticosteroids, and convalescent plasma for SARS. Despite these interventions, his lung compliance worsened, and he developed a pneumothorax secondary to barotrauma from mechanical ventilation. He eventually succumbed to refractory hypoxaemia and tension pneumothorax.

severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_sars_018:
  primary_diagnosis: severe acute respiratory syndrome with neurological sequelae
  presenting_complaint: headache, photophobia, and altered consciousness
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female diagnosed with SARS developed signs of meningism on day 8. Lumbar puncture revealed a mild lymphocytic pleocytosis, and SARS-CoV RNA was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid via PCR. She was diagnosed with SARS-associated encephalitis and required intensive supportive care for neurological stabilization.

severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_sars_019:
  primary_diagnosis: moderate severe acute respiratory syndrome
  presenting_complaint: persistent dry cough and exertional breathlessness
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old fitness instructor presented with a 5-day history of "flu-like" symptoms. Oxygen saturations were 94% on room air, and CXR showed unilateral lower lobe consolidation. He was managed on a general medical ward with simple oxygen therapy and was discharged after 6 days with no long-term complications.

severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_sars_020:
  primary_diagnosis: severe acute respiratory syndrome (diagnostic challenge)
  presenting_complaint: fever and cough with initial negative testing
  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old male presented with classic symptoms but two consecutive nasopharyngeal swabs were negative for SARS-CoV-1. Due to high clinical suspicion and a travel history to a cluster site, a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed, which returned a positive PCR result. This case highlighted the importance of lower respiratory tract sampling in suspected SARS.
