parosmia_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-viral parosmia
  presenting_complaint: Distorted sense of smell following COVID-19 infection.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female presented to ENT outpatient clinics six months after a mild COVID-19 infection. She reported that coffee, onions, and meat smelled like "sewage" or "burnt chemicals," leading to significant dietary restrictions. Clinical examination and nasendoscopy were normal; she was commenced on olfactory training and high-dose Vitamin A nasal drops with moderate improvement at one year.

parosmia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-traumatic parosmia
  presenting_complaint: Foul smell triggered by food and perfumes following a head injury.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male sustained a frontal lobe contusion and cribriform plate fracture in a road traffic accident. Three months post-injury, he developed severe parosmia where all cooked food smelled of rotting flesh. MRI confirmed olfactory bulb atrophy; despite trials of gabapentin, the condition remains chronic and debilitating two years later.

parosmia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric post-viral parosmia
  presenting_complaint: Refusal to eat hot foods due to "stinky" smells.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old girl was referred by her GP after a three-week history of food aversion following a seasonal URTI. She described the smell of the school canteen as "bins," causing significant distress and weight loss of 2kg. Management involved a paediatric dietitian and "flavourless" cold food trials, with spontaneous resolution after four months.

parosmia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Prodromal Parkinson’s disease associated parosmia
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent distortion of floral and food odours.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male presented with a two-year history of mild hyposmia that recently progressed to parosmia, specifically noting that roses smelled like "burning rubber." Neurological review identified a subtle resting tremor and bradykinesia. He was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, and the parosmia was identified as an early non-motor manifestation.

parosmia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Occupational chemical-induced parosmia
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of foul smells following industrial solvent exposure.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old factory worker was exposed to high concentrations of toluene vapours due to a ventilation failure. He immediately developed parosmia, describing all ambient scents as "metallic and acrid." Occupational health monitoring and removal from the environment led to a partial recovery over eight months, though some distortions persist.

parosmia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe parosmia-induced malnutrition
  presenting_complaint: Life-threatening weight loss and inability to tolerate oral intake.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old woman with severe post-viral parosmia was admitted to the medical ward with a BMI of 14.8 and electrolyte imbalances. She reported that even water had a "chemical" taste, leading to total food avoidance. She required nasogastric feeding and intensive psychological support for secondary depression before transitioning to a restricted but safe oral diet.

parosmia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis
  presenting_complaint: Nasal congestion and distorted smell of household cleaners.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with known asthma and nasal polyps reported that citrus-scented cleaners smelled like "vomit." CT sinuses showed pan-sinus opacification (Lund-Mackay score 18). Following functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) and long-term nasal steroids, her parosmia significantly decreased as the inflammatory load was reduced.

parosmia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Pregnancy-related parosmia
  presenting_complaint: Severe nausea triggered by distorted perception of cooking smells.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old woman in her first trimester (12 weeks) reported that previously loved scents, such as garlic and her husband's cologne, became unbearable and "rancid." This exacerbated her hyperemesis gravidarum, requiring hospitalisation for IV rehydration. The symptoms resolved spontaneously within 48 hours of delivery.

parosmia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-neurosurgical parosmia
  presenting_complaint: Acute distortion of smell following pituitary surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male underwent a transsphenoidal resection of a pituitary adenoma. Post-operatively, he complained that all hospital food smelled like "wet dog." This was attributed to intraoperative manipulation near the olfactory grooves; the symptoms were transient and fully resolved by his six-week follow-up.

parosmia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Migraine-associated parosmia
  presenting_complaint: Paroxysmal foul smells preceding severe headaches.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old woman described 30-minute episodes where everything smelled like "burnt toast" or "sulphur," followed by a unilateral throbbing headache and photophobia. Brain MRI was unremarkable. She was diagnosed with migraine with olfactory aura (cacosmia/parosmia) and saw a significant reduction in episodes after starting propranolol prophylaxis.

parosmia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory post-viral parosmia
  presenting_complaint: Persistent foul smells despite multiple therapeutic trials.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male with an 18-month history of parosmia following a viral URTI failed to respond to olfactory training, oral steroids, and sodium citrate drops. He reported significant social isolation as he could no longer dine out. He was eventually referred to a specialist smell clinic for consideration of stellate ganglion block, reflecting the severity and treatment-resistant nature of his case.

parosmia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Psychogenic parosmia
  presenting_complaint: Distorted smells associated with paranoid ideation.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male presented with complaints that his neighbours were pumping "poisonous gas" into his flat, which he could smell as a "sweet, rotting scent." Extensive ENT and neurological investigations were normal. After psychiatric evaluation, he was diagnosed with a first-episode psychosis, and the olfactory distortions resolved with risperidone treatment.

parosmia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Chemotherapy-induced parosmia
  presenting_complaint: Metallic and unpleasant smell of all protein-based foods.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female undergoing cisplatin and etoposide for lung cancer developed severe parosmia during her second cycle. She described a persistent "metallic" distortion that made meat and eggs unpalatable. Symptoms were managed with plastic cutlery and cold meals to minimise aroma, and the parosmia resolved three months post-chemotherapy completion.

parosmia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute URTI-associated parosmia
  presenting_complaint: Brief period of distorted smell during a common cold.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old university student noted that her morning coffee smelled like "cigarette ash" for ten days while suffering from an acute viral rhinitis. No specific treatment was required. As her nasal congestion and rhinorrhoea cleared, her sense of smell returned to its baseline normal state.

parosmia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Zinc deficiency-related parosmia
  presenting_complaint: Distorted smell and taste in an elderly malnourished patient.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male resident in a nursing home was noted to have reduced oral intake and reported that food smelled "wrong." Blood tests revealed a significant zinc deficiency (6.2 µmol/L). Following three months of oral zinc sulphate supplementation, his parosmia resolved and his appetite improved, leading to a 3kg weight gain.

parosmia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Temporal lobe epilepsy
  presenting_complaint: Brief, repetitive episodes of "fecal" smell.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male reported sudden, 10-second bursts where the air smelled like "sewage," often followed by a period of lip-smacking and confusion. EEG demonstrated sharp wave activity in the right temporal lobe. He was diagnosed with focal impaired awareness seizures, and the "parosmia" (cacosmia) episodes ceased upon starting levetiracetam.

parosmia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Burning mouth syndrome with associated parosmia
  presenting_complaint: Oral burning sensation and distorted smell of peppermint.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old post-menopausal woman presented with a scalding sensation on her tongue and parosmia, specifically noting that toothpaste smelled like "petrol." Investigations for vitamin deficiencies and autoimmune markers were negative. She was diagnosed with Burning Mouth Syndrome and started on low-dose amitriptyline, which improved both the burning and the olfactory distortion.

parosmia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-ICU parosmia
  presenting_complaint: Distorted smells following prolonged intubation for sepsis.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male survivor of septic shock and multi-organ failure noted parosmia during his rehabilitation phase. He had been intubated for 14 days and had a tracheostomy. The etiology was thought to be multifactorial, including previous viral insult and possible neurocognitive sequelae of critical illness; he showed slow improvement over 12 months of community rehab.

parosmia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Olfactory neuroblastoma
  presenting_complaint: Progressive unilateral parosmia and occasional epistaxis.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female reported that for four months, smells only on the left side were distorted and "earthy." She also noted two episodes of minor left-sided epistaxis. Nasendoscopy revealed a friable mass in the superior nasal vault; biopsy confirmed an olfactory neuroblastoma (Esthesioneuroblastoma), and she was referred for craniofacial resection and radiotherapy.

parosmia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic idiopathic parosmia
  presenting_complaint: Long-standing distorted smell with no identifiable trigger.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old woman had suffered from parosmia for three years, where perfumes and coffee consistently smelled like "mouldy wood." Extensive investigations including MRI, CT, and blood panels were entirely normal. She engaged in a structured 24-week olfactory training programme using four essential oils and reported an 80% improvement in her "Smell Sensitivity Score."
