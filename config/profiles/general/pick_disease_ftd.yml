  primary_diagnosis: Semantic variant Frontotemporal Dementia
  presenting_complaint: Loss of word meaning and difficulty naming common objects.
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old female schoolteacher reported increasing difficulty understanding complex vocabulary and identifying household items. SPECT imaging showed asymmetric left temporal lobe hypoperfusion. She was started on speech and language therapy for semantic dementia, a clinical manifestation of Pick's pathology.

  primary_diagnosis: Pick's Disease with secondary dysphagia
  presenting_complaint: Severe cognitive decline and recurrent choking episodes.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with established Pick's disease progressed to a severe state characterized by mutism and hyperorality. He developed significant oropharyngeal dysphagia leading to aspiration pneumonia. Management focused on palliative care and modified diet consistency in a nursing home setting.

pick_disease_ftd_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Early-onset Pick's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive personality change and ritualistic behaviours.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old female was initially misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder due to sudden impulsivity and excessive spending. Subsequent FDG-PET showed profound bifrontal hypometabolism. Genetic testing was negative for C9orf72, and clinical features were highly suggestive of sporadic Pick's disease.

pick_disease_ftd_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Non-fluent variant Primary Progressive Aphasia (Pick's)
  presenting_complaint: Effortful, halting speech and agrammatism.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented with a subacute onset of speech apraxia and simplified sentence structure. Neurological examination noted mild right-sided rigidity. MRI confirmed left perisylvian atrophy, and he was managed with SSRIs for associated irritability.

pick_disease_ftd_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Pick's Disease with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (FTD-MND)
  presenting_complaint: Weakness in hands and inappropriate laughing.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male presented with behavioural changes followed by progressive muscle wasting and fasciculations. EMG confirmed motor neurone involvement alongside frontal cognitive deficits. The condition was rapidly progressive, requiring multidisciplinary input for both cognitive and physical decline.

pick_disease_ftd_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Pick's Disease presenting with hyperorality
  presenting_complaint: Compulsive overeating and preference for sweet foods.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male developed an insatiable appetite, gaining 15kg in six months, alongside stealing food from others. Cognitive screening showed impaired frontal fluency. He was diagnosed with Pick's disease and managed with environmental modifications to restrict food access.

pick_disease_ftd_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Apathetic variant Pick's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Profound lack of motivation and self-neglect.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female was brought to the clinic by family due to total withdrawal from social activities and failure to maintain personal hygiene. Initially treated for late-life depression, she failed to respond to antidepressants. MRI later showed significant anterior cingulate atrophy consistent with Pick's disease.

pick_disease_ftd_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Pick's Disease (Probable)
  presenting_complaint: New-onset shoplifting and lack of social insight.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old civil servant with no prior criminal record was arrested for petty theft. Clinical assessment revealed a lack of remorse and "utilization behaviour" (compulsively using objects in view). Neuroimaging confirmed Pick-type lobar atrophy, necessitating a transition to a secure mental health unit.

pick_disease_ftd_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Pick's Disease with acute delirium
  presenting_complaint: Sudden aggression and confusion in a patient with known dementia.
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male with moderate Pick's disease presented to A&E with acute-on-chronic agitation. Investigation revealed a urinary tract infection (UTI) causing delirium. Treatment with intravenous antibiotics and low-dose quetiapine stabilized his behaviour before discharge back to his care home.

pick_disease_ftd_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Pick's Disease with Obsessive-Compulsive symptoms
  presenting_complaint: Rigid adherence to routines and hoarding.
  summary_of_course: A 57-year-old female began spending hours daily rearranging furniture and collecting discarded newspapers. Neuropsychological testing showed profound perseveration. Diagnosis of Pick's disease was made based on clinical phenotype and frontal atrophy on CT.

pick_disease_ftd_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Late-presentation Pick's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Memory loss and personality changes in an elderly patient.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male presented with symptoms mimicking Alzheimer's, but family noted he had become strangely tactless and coarse. CSF biomarkers (tau/amyloid ratio) were normal, but MRI showed focal frontal thinning. He was diagnosed with late-onset Pick's disease and managed with person-centred care.

pick_disease_ftd_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Pick's Disease with Parkinsonian features
  presenting_complaint: Gait instability and executive dysfunction.
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old male presented with a shuffling gait and frequent falls alongside progressive apathy. Examination showed axial rigidity and bradykinesia that responded poorly to Levodopa. The combination of early behavioural changes and extrapyramidal signs suggested a Pick-complex tauopathy.

pick_disease_ftd_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Pick's Disease (Mild)
  presenting_complaint: Subtle decline in professional decision-making.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old executive was referred after making several impulsive, high-risk financial decisions. Initial MRI was reported as normal, but a follow-up FDG-PET 12 months later showed bilateral frontal hypometabolism. He was diagnosed with early-stage Pick's disease and retired on medical grounds.

pick_disease_ftd_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Pick's Disease with treatment-resistant agitation
  presenting_complaint: Severe physical aggression towards caregivers.
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male with Pick's disease became increasingly violent, failing to respond to sertraline and trazodone. He required admission to a specialist dementia challenging behaviour unit. Stabilization was eventually achieved using a combination of sodium valproate and environmental de-escalation strategies.

pick_disease_ftd_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Pick's Disease in a rural setting
  presenting_complaint: Neglect of livestock and farm management.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old farmer was found to have neglected his animals, a stark departure from his previous diligent nature. Local GP assessment identified significant cognitive impairment and loss of executive function. He was diagnosed with Pick's disease and transitioned to a community support programme for rural elderly.

pick_disease_ftd_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Pick's Disease (Severe)
  presenting_complaint: Total mutism and incontinence.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female in the end-stages of Pick's disease was bedbound and required total nursing care. She exhibited "Klüver-Bucy" like symptoms, including a tendency to put non-food objects in her mouth. Management was entirely supportive, focusing on skin integrity and comfort.

pick_disease_ftd_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Pick's Disease with hypersexuality
  presenting_complaint: Inappropriate sexual comments and touching.
  summary_of_course: A 51-year-old male was sectioned under the Mental Health Act after several incidents of public indecency. Clinical workup ruled out primary psychiatric disorders and identified significant frontal lobe atrophy. He was started on SSRIs to help modulate impulsive sexual behaviours associated with his Pick's diagnosis.

pick_disease_ftd_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Pick's Disease with comorbid Type 2 Diabetes
  presenting_complaint: Poor glycaemic control due to dietary indiscretion.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male with Pick's disease and T2DM presented with a HbA1c of 98 mmol/mol. His hyperorality led to compulsive consumption of sugary snacks, complicating his medical management. Caregivers required specialist training to manage his diet while respecting his cognitive limitations.

pick_disease_ftd_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Pick's Disease (Diagnostic Challenge)
  presenting_complaint: Fluctuating mood and social withdrawal.
  summary_of_course: A 53-year-old female presented with symptoms initially attributed to menopause and work-related stress. Over 3 years, her personality changed from extroverted to profoundly cold and detached. Final diagnosis of Pick's disease was confirmed by serial MRI scans showing progressive "knife-edge" temporal atrophy.
