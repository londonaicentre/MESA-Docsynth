essential_tremor_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Essential tremor
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral postural hand tremor and difficulty drinking from a cup.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male presented to his GP with a 5-year history of progressive shaking in both hands, worse when holding a newspaper. Physical examination revealed a 6Hz kinetic tremor with no bradykinesia or rigidity. He was started on Propranolol 40mg BD with significant improvement in his activities of daily living.

essential_tremor_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Early-onset essential tremor
  presenting_complaint: Fine hand tremor exacerbated by social anxiety and public speaking.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female university student reported a fine bilateral hand tremor present since her teens, now affecting her confidence during presentations. Neurological examination was normal except for a mild postural tremor. She was managed with PRN Propranolol for high-stress situations and referred for CBT to manage associated social anxiety.

essential_tremor_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe refractory essential tremor
  presenting_complaint: Disabling bilateral upper limb tremor and inability to self-feed.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old female with a 30-year history of ET presented with severe functional impairment despite maximal doses of Primidone and Topiramate. Her Archimedes spiral drawing was uninterpretable due to high-amplitude kinetic oscillations. She was referred to a specialist neuroscience centre for consideration of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the ventral intermediate nucleus.

essential_tremor_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Essential tremor with head involvement
  presenting_complaint: Involuntary "yes-yes" head nodding and shaky voice.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female presented with a prominent titubation (head tremor) and a tremulous voice that affected her telephone communication. Laryngoscopy confirmed a vocal cord tremor, and clinical examination showed a mild postural hand tremor. She was treated with Botulinum toxin injections into the neck muscles and referred to speech and language therapy.

essential_tremor_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Familial essential tremor
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral hand shaking and strong family history of tremors.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented noting that his tremor was identical to his father's and grandfather's. The tremor was alcohol-responsive, a classic feature he noted during social events. Genetic counselling was provided, and he was started on Gabapentin after failing to tolerate beta-blockers due to symptomatic bradycardia.

essential_tremor_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Essential tremor exacerbated by hyperthyroidism
  presenting_complaint: Acute worsening of long-standing hand tremor and palpitations.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female with known mild ET presented with a subacute transition to a severe, high-frequency tremor. Investigations revealed a suppressed TSH and elevated T4, confirming Graves' disease. The tremor intensity reduced back to baseline levels once her thyrotoxicosis was treated with Carbimazole.

essential_tremor_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric essential tremor
  presenting_complaint: Shaky hands during fine motor tasks at school.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy was brought to the paediatric neurology clinic due to difficulties with handwriting and using a compass in geometry. Examination showed a fine-amplitude, high-frequency kinetic tremor of both hands. After excluding Wilson's disease via caeruloplasmin levels, a diagnosis of paediatric ET was made, and he was managed conservatively with school accommodations.

essential_tremor_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Essential tremor-Parkinson's disease overlap syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Long-standing tremor with new-onset slowness of movement.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with a 20-year history of ET presented with a new rest component to his tremor and a shuffling gait. A DaTSCAN was performed, showing reduced uptake in the striatum, confirming a dual diagnosis of PD emerging on a background of ET. His treatment regimen was adjusted to include Levodopa alongside his existing ET medications.

essential_tremor_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Orthostatic tremor
  presenting_complaint: Leg shakiness and instability only when standing still.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female reported a distressing "shuddering" sensation in her legs that resolved immediately upon sitting or walking. Surface EMG of the gastrocnemius demonstrated a characteristic 13-18 Hz tremor pathognomonic for orthostatic tremor (an ET variant). She responded well to low-dose Clonazepam, which significantly improved her standing tolerance.

essential_tremor_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Essential tremor with Primidone-induced ataxia
  presenting_complaint: Worsening tremor and new-onset unsteadiness on feet.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with moderate ET was titrated onto Primidone 250mg TDS. While his tremor improved, he developed significant gait ataxia and drowsiness, leading to a fall. The medication was tapered down, and he was switched to Topiramate, which provided adequate tremor control without the cerebellar side effects.

essential_tremor_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Occupational-limiting essential tremor
  presenting_complaint: Interference with surgical precision and fine motor control.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old ophthalmic surgeon presented with a mild but career-threatening kinetic tremor during microsurgery. Neurological workup was negative for alternative pathologies. He was successfully managed with a combination of low-dose Propranolol and ergonomic adjustments in the operating theatre, allowing him to continue his surgical practice.

essential_tremor_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Essential tremor with depressive symptoms
  presenting_complaint: Severe tremor leading to social withdrawal and low mood.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old widower presented with a severe bilateral hand tremor that prevented him from eating in public, leading to isolation. Assessment using the TETRAS scale confirmed severe ET, and he screened positive for clinical depression. A multidisciplinary approach involving occupational therapy for weighted utensils and Mirtazapine for mood resulted in improved quality of life.

essential_tremor_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic essential tremor exacerbation
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of tremor following new medication.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with stable ET was prescribed Salbutamol for a COPD flare-up, which triggered a dramatic increase in tremor amplitude. He presented to the A&E department concerned about a stroke, but examination showed a symmetrical postural tremor without focal deficits. His tremor returned to baseline after his respiratory medications were optimised and his Propranolol dose was temporarily increased.

essential_tremor_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Dystonic tremor mimicking essential tremor
  presenting_complaint: Persistent right-hand tremor with unusual wrist posturing.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male was referred for "refractory ET" but clinical review noted the tremor was slightly asymmetric and associated with mild cocking of the wrist (dystonic posturing). Null points were identified where the tremor ceased in specific positions. He was rediagnosed with dystonic tremor and successfully treated with targeted Botulinum toxin injections rather than systemic ET medications.

essential_tremor_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Essential tremor post-MRgFUS
  presenting_complaint: Follow-up after MRI-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male with severe, unilateral-dominant ET underwent MRgFUS targeting the left VIM nucleus. Post-procedural assessment showed a 90% reduction in right-hand tremor and significant improvement in his handwriting. He experienced transient perioral paraesthesia post-op, which resolved within three weeks.

essential_tremor_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild essential tremor
  presenting_complaint: Occasional shaking of hands when tired or stressed.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female presented with a very mild postural tremor that did not interfere with her work as a teacher. She was concerned about Parkinson's disease due to a neighbour's diagnosis. After a thorough examination and reassurance that her symptoms were consistent with mild ET, she opted for watchful waiting without pharmacological intervention.

essential_tremor_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Essential tremor with cognitive impairment
  presenting_complaint: Progressive tremor and memory loss in an elderly patient.
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old female with long-standing ET was brought in by her daughter due to increasing confusion and difficulty managing her tremor medications. A diagnosis of comorbid Alzheimer's dementia was made. Her ET management was simplified to a once-daily long-acting Propranolol formulation to improve compliance and reduce the burden on her carers.

essential_tremor_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Essential tremor exacerbated by SSRI use
  presenting_complaint: Increase in tremor frequency after starting Sertraline.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with mild ET started Sertraline for a major depressive episode, which resulted in a noticeable increase in his hand shaking. The tremor was distinguished from serotonin syndrome by the lack of clonus or autonomic instability. The SSRI was switched to Mirtazapine, which had a more neutral effect on his tremor.

essential_tremor_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Essential tremor with isolated tongue tremor
  presenting_complaint: Rhythmic movement of the tongue and mild dysarthria.
  summary_of_course: A 73-year-old male presented with a rare manifestation of ET involving an isolated tongue tremor alongside his bilateral hand tremor. This caused a rhythmic quality to his speech. MRI brain was normal, and the tremor responded partially to Primidone, with significant improvement noted by his family in his speech clarity.

essential_tremor_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Essential tremor in a patient with contraindications to beta-blockers
  presenting_complaint: Moderate hand tremor in a patient with severe asthma.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male required treatment for ET but had a history of life-threatening asthma, contraindicating Propranolol. He was started on Topiramate, titrated slowly to 50mg BD to avoid cognitive side effects ("word-finding" difficulties). He achieved good tremor control and maintained his respiratory function without exacerbation.
