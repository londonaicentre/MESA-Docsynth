  primary_diagnosis: Squamous cell carcinoma with hypercalcaemia of malignancy
  presenting_complaint: Nausea, constipation, and polyuria
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with a known 50-pack-year smoking history presented with symptoms of severe hypercalcaemia (corrected calcium 3.45 mmol/L). A CT scan identified a large cavitating squamous cell carcinoma in the right lung. He was treated with intravenous bisphosphonates and fluids before commencing palliative radiotherapy to the primary site.

primary_cancer_lung_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Bronchial Carcinoid tumour
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent chest infections and localized wheeze
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female non-smoker had been treated for "adult-onset asthma" for two years before a persistent wheeze prompted further investigation. A CT scan showed an endobronchial lesion obstructing the right middle lobe bronchus. Bronchoscopic resection and histopathology confirmed a typical carcinoid tumour with clear margins and no further treatment required.

primary_cancer_lung_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with malignant pericardial effusion
  presenting_complaint: Exercise intolerance and muffled heart sounds
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male presented with subacute heart failure symptoms and orthopnoea. Echocardiography revealed a large pericardial effusion with features of tamponade, and drainage showed malignant cells consistent with lung adenocarcinoma. He underwent a pericardial window procedure for symptom relief and commenced systemic immunotherapy.

primary_cancer_lung_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Squamous cell carcinoma with post-obstructive pneumonia
  presenting_complaint: Fever, rigors, and purulent sputum
  summary_of_course: A 71-year-old male was admitted with acute sepsis secondary to a right-sided pneumonia. Failure to resolve with standard antibiotics led to a CT scan showing a central tumour obstructing the bronchus intermedius. Biopsy confirmed squamous cell carcinoma, and the patient required a bronchial stent to facilitate drainage of the distal infection before starting oncology treatment.

primary_cancer_lung_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with spinal cord compression
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset lower limb weakness and urinary retention
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old female presented with acute-on-chronic back pain and new neurological deficits. MRI revealed spinal cord compression at T4 due to a metastatic deposit from an unknown primary.

  primary_diagnosis: Adenocarcinoma of the lung in a patient with severe COPD
  presenting_complaint: Worsening baseline dyspnoea and cachexia
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male with GOLD stage IV COPD was found to have a 3cm lung nodule during a routine exacerbation workup. Due to extremely poor lung function (FEV1 30% predicted), he was not a surgical candidate. He was treated with Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) as a curative-intent outpatient procedure, which he tolerated well.

primary_cancer_lung_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Small cell lung cancer with Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Progressive proximal muscle weakness and dry mouth
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male presented with difficulty rising from a chair and climbing stairs. Electromyography findings were suggestive of Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome, prompting a search for an underlying malignancy. CT chest revealed a small central mass confirmed as SCLC, and his neurological symptoms improved significantly following the initiation of chemotherapy.

primary_cancer_lung_016:
  primary_diagnosis: NSCLC with brain metastases and haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset hemiparesis and decreased consciousness
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female presented with stroke-like symptoms; however, CT head showed an acute intracranial haemorrhage into a pre-existing metastatic lesion. Further staging identified a primary lung adenocarcinoma. Given her poor performance status and the severity of the bleed, she was managed with best supportive care and passed away shortly after admission.

primary_cancer_lung_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Squamous cell carcinoma with massive haemoptysis
  presenting_complaint: Coughing up large volumes of bright red blood
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with known central squamous cell carcinoma was admitted to the ICU with life-threatening haemoptysis. He underwent emergency bronchial artery embolization by interventional radiology to stabilize the bleeding. Following stabilization, he was transitioned to palliative radiotherapy to reduce the risk of further haemorrhage.
