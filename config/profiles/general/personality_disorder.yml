  primary_diagnosis: Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder
  presenting_complaint: Severe "splitting" behaviour on an inpatient medical ward.

  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with a lifelong history of being "difficult" and suspicious became increasingly isolated following his wife's death. He accused carers of stealing and tampering with his medications. Differentiation from late-onset schizophrenia or dementia was required; history confirmed these traits had been present since his 30s, though exacerbated by age-related frailty.

personality_disorder_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (EUPD)
  presenting_complaint: Treatment-resistant depression and chronic suicidality.
