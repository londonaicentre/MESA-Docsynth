She was managed conservatively with analgesia, a soft brace, and an urgent referral to the fracture liaison service for bone density optimisation.

fracture_of_lumbar_spine_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Unstable L2 burst fracture
  presenting_complaint: Intense lower back pain and lower limb weakness following a road traffic accident
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male was brought to A&E after a high-velocity motorcycle collision. CT imaging revealed a comminuted burst fracture of L2 with 40% canal stenosis and retropulsion of bone fragments. He underwent urgent posterior spinal fixation and decompression; post-operatively, he regained partial motor function but requires long-term neuro-rehabilitation.

fracture_of_lumbar_spine_003:
  primary_diagnosis: L3 Chance fracture
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal and mid-lumbar pain following a head-on collision
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy wearing a lap-only seatbelt was involved in a high-speed RTA.

  primary_diagnosis: L5 spondylolysis (stress fracture)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic lower back pain worsened by hyperextension
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old elite gymnast presented with a three-month history of activity-related lumbar pain. SPECT-CT confirmed an active stress fracture of the pars interarticularis at L5.

  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic L2 and L3 wedge fractures
  presenting_complaint: Worsening back pain and increased kyphotic deformity
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with pre-existing L2 wedge fractures presented after a minor trip at home. New imaging revealed an acute L3 superior endplate fracture alongside the chronic L2 deformity. Due to poor pain control and declining mobility, he underwent a percutaneous kyphoplasty of L3, which provided immediate symptomatic relief.

fracture_of_lumbar_spine_007:
  primary_diagnosis: L1 trans-discal fracture in Ankylosing Spondylitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe pain and "feeling of instability" after a low-energy fall
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with long-standing ankylosing spondylitis fell from a standing height. CT imaging demonstrated a "carrot-stick" fracture through the L1 disc space, extending through the fused posterior elements. Given the high risk of neurological deterioration in a "bamboo spine," he underwent urgent long-segment posterior instrumental fixation.

  presenting_complaint: Sudden back pain while lifting a kettle
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female on long-term prednisolone for systemic lupus erythematosus presented with acute lumbar pain. MRI confirmed an acute L3 compression fracture with no evidence of malignancy. She was managed with a reduction in steroid dose where possible and initiation of teriparatide therapy.

fracture_of_lumbar_spine_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Stable L1 burst fracture
  presenting_complaint: Mid-back pain after a snowboarding accident
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male fell onto his buttocks while jumping. CT showed an L1 burst fracture with less than 20% loss of height and no posterior element involvement. He was treated non-operatively in a thoracolumbar orthosis for 12 weeks with serial imaging showing stable union.

  primary_diagnosis: L5 vertebral body fracture with Cauda Equina Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Back pain, saddle anaesthesia, and urinary retention
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male presented 48 hours after a heavy lifting injury. MRI revealed a displaced fracture of the L5 body with a large associated disc-osteophyte complex causing severe compression of the cauda equina. He underwent emergency decompressive laminectomy and fracture stabilisation, with partial recovery of bladder function at six months.

  primary_diagnosis: L2 wedge fracture with delayed non-union
  presenting_complaint: Persistent focal pain six months after initial injury
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female was initially treated conservatively for an L2 wedge fracture. Follow-up MRI with STIR sequences showed persistent bone marrow oedema and intravertebral vacuum cleft (Kümmell disease), indicating non-union. She was successfully treated with a targeted vertebral augmentation (vertebroplasty).

fracture_of_lumbar_spine_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Multiple lumbar micro-fractures secondary to Osteogenesis Imperfecta
  presenting_complaint: Generalised lumbar ache and progressive loss of height
  summary_of_course: A 9-year-old girl with Type III Osteogenesis Imperfecta presented for routine review. Spinal radiographs showed multiple biconcave "codfish" vertebrae and several new micro-fractures across L1-L5. Her pamidronate infusion schedule was adjusted, and she was provided with a custom lightweight spinal jacket.

fracture_of_lumbar_spine_015:

  presenting_complaint: Fever, night sweats, and localized L3 spine tenderness
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with type 2 diabetes presented with a two-week history of back pain and rigors. MRI showed discitis at L2/L3 with secondary pathological fracture and collapse of the L3 superior endplate. He was treated with six weeks of intravenous flucloxacillin and spinal bracing, avoiding the need for surgical stabilisation.

fracture_of_lumbar_spine_016:
  primary_diagnosis: L4 fracture with associated retroperitoneal haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Hypotension and severe back pain following a crush injury
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male was crushed by heavy machinery at work. CT revealed an unstable L4 fracture and a large retroperitoneal haematoma causing haemodynamic instability. Following arterial embolisation for the haemorrhage, he was stabilised and later underwent posterior lumbar fusion.

fracture_of_lumbar_spine_017:
  primary_diagnosis: L1 compression fracture in a patient with Multiple Myeloma
  presenting_complaint: New onset back pain and lethargy
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male presented with a sudden "crack" in his back while bending. Investigations revealed a plasmacytoma at L1 with an associated fracture, alongside hypercalcaemia and anaemia. He was started on chemotherapy (bortezomib-based) and received local radiotherapy to the L1 lesion.

fracture_of_lumbar_spine_018:
  primary_diagnosis: L2 wedge fracture with secondary ileus
  presenting_complaint: Back pain, abdominal distension, and vomiting
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old female was admitted with an acute L1/L2 wedge fracture after falling in her care home. Her course was complicated by a paralytic ileus, likely secondary to retroperitoneal irritation from the fracture. She was managed with nasogastric decompression and parenteral nutrition until bowel function returned and her pain was controlled.

fracture_of_lumbar_spine_019:
  primary_diagnosis: L3 fracture in Paget’s disease of bone
  presenting_complaint: Deep, boring bone pain in the lumbar region
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with known Paget’s disease presented with an acute increase in pain. Imaging showed the characteristic "picture frame" vertebra at L3 with a new transverse cortical fracture. He was treated with intravenous zoledronic acid and analgesia, with subsequent improvement in bone turnover markers and pain levels.

fracture_of_lumbar_spine_020:
  primary_diagnosis: L1/L2 seatbelt-type distraction injury
  presenting_complaint: Mid-lumbar pain and bruising across the abdomen
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female was involved in a high-speed RTA. CT demonstrated an L1/L2 distraction injury involving the posterior ligamentous complex but with minimal vertebral body height loss. Due to the ligamentous instability confirmed on MRI, she underwent posterior percutaneous pedicle screw fixation.
