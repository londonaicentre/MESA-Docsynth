  presenting_complaint: Severe bilateral leg pain and tea-coloured urine following a crush injury.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male construction worker was trapped under masonry for six hours. On admission to A&E, his CK was 185,000 IU/L with hyperkalaemia (K+ 6.8 mmol/L) and AKI stage 3. He required urgent fasciotomies for compartment syndrome and continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVH) in ICU for five days before renal recovery.

rhabdomyolysis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Statin-induced rhabdomyolysis
  presenting_complaint: Progressive muscle weakness and generalised myalgia over two weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female recently started on high-dose atorvastatin (80mg) for secondary prevention. She presented with profound proximal weakness and a CK of 12,400 IU/L. The statin was discontinued, and she was treated with aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation, leading to a full recovery of muscle strength and normalisation of renal function.

rhabdomyolysis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Rhabdomyolysis secondary to prolonged immobilisation
  presenting_complaint: Confusion and inability to weight bear after a fall.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with dementia was found on the floor 18 hours after a fall. Investigations revealed a CK of 15,000 IU/L and a creatinine of 210 µmol/L (baseline 85). He was managed on a geriatric ward with cautious IV 0.9% sodium chloride to avoid fluid overload, resulting in a gradual decline in CK levels over one week.

rhabdomyolysis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Exertional rhabdomyolysis
  presenting_complaint: Severe swelling and pain in both upper arms following intensive weightlifting.
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old male performed a high-intensity "CrossFit" workout after a six-month hiatus. He presented to the GP with "coca-cola" coloured urine and a CK of 42,000 IU/L.

  presenting_complaint: Refusal to walk and calf tenderness following a flu-like illness.
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old girl presented four days after testing positive for Influenza A with acute-onset bilateral calf pain. Her CK was elevated at 4,500 IU/L with positive myoglobinuria. She was treated with oral rehydration and paracetamol in the paediatric assessment unit and was discharged once CK levels began to trend downwards.

rhabdomyolysis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Cocaine-induced rhabdomyolysis with multi-organ failure
  presenting_complaint: Agitation, hyperthermia, and collapse following drug ingestion.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male was brought to A&E by ambulance with a temperature of 40.5°C and seizures. Laboratory tests showed a CK of 210,000 IU/L, metabolic acidosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Despite aggressive cooling, dantrolene administration, and renal replacement therapy in ICU, he succumbed to multi-organ failure.

rhabdomyolysis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)
  presenting_complaint: Lead-pipe rigidity, fever, and altered mental status.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with schizophrenia recently increased her dose of haloperidol. She presented with autonomic instability and a CK of 28,000 IU/L. She was managed in ICU with bromocriptine and aggressive fluid therapy, leading to a slow resolution of rigidity and renal preservation.

rhabdomyolysis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: McArdle's Disease (GSD Type V)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of muscle cramping and dark urine since adolescence.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male presented with exercise-induced "second wind" phenomenon and occasional pigmenturia. During a severe episode after a football match, his CK peaked at 18,000 IU/L.

rhabdomyolysis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute compartment syndrome with secondary rhabdomyolysis
  presenting_complaint: Excruciating lower leg pain out of proportion to clinical findings post-fracture.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male underwent an intramedullary nail for a tibial fracture. Post-operatively, he developed tense swelling and loss of sensation in the foot, with a CK rise to 35,000 IU/L. Emergency four-compartment fasciotomy was performed, and he required long-term physiotherapy for residual peroneal nerve palsy.

rhabdomyolysis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypokalaemia-induced rhabdomyolysis
  presenting_complaint: Profound generalised weakness and muscle aches.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female with a history of bulimia nervosa presented with a serum potassium of 1.8 mmol/L. The severe hypokalaemia triggered muscle cell membrane instability, resulting in a CK of 11,000 IU/L. Potassium replacement was carefully titrated alongside IV fluids, resolving the rhabdomyolysis without permanent renal damage.

rhabdomyolysis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Heatstroke-associated rhabdomyolysis
  presenting_complaint: Collapse and delirium during a marathon in 30°C heat.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male collapsed at mile 22 of a summer marathon. On arrival, his core temperature was 41.2°C and his CK was 95,000 IU/L. He developed AKI stage 2 and was treated with evaporative cooling and large-volume crystalloids, eventually recovering after a 10-day hospital stay.

rhabdomyolysis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Electrical injury-induced rhabdomyolysis
  presenting_complaint: Entry and exit burns following a high-voltage industrial accident.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old electrician sustained a 11kV shock. Although skin burns were limited to 10% TBSA, deep tissue necrosis resulted in a CK of 150,000 IU/L and dark red urine. He underwent multiple debridements and was maintained on alkaline diuresis to prevent myoglobin-induced nephropathy.

rhabdomyolysis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Drug-interaction induced rhabdomyolysis (Statin and Macrolide)
  presenting_complaint: Severe myalgia and inability to walk after starting antibiotics.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male on long-term simvastatin was prescribed clarithromycin for a chest infection. Five days later, he presented with a CK of 55,000 IU/L and AKI stage 3. The inhibition of CYP3A4 led to toxic statin levels; he required three sessions of intermittent haemodialysis before his renal function stabilised.

rhabdomyolysis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Pyomyositis-associated rhabdomyolysis
  presenting_complaint: Fever and localised thigh pain and swelling.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes presented with a Staphylococcus aureus thigh abscess. Systemic inflammatory response and local muscle destruction led to a CK of 9,000 IU/L. Treatment involved surgical incision and drainage, IV flucloxacillin, and fluid resuscitation.

rhabdomyolysis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Malignant Hyperthermia
  presenting_complaint: Rapid rise in end-tidal CO2 and muscle rigidity during general anaesthesia.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old female underwent an elective cholecystectomy; following administration of suxamethonium and isoflurane, she developed masseter spasm and tachycardia. Her CK rose to 60,000 IU/L within hours. Prompt administration of IV dantrolene and transfer to ICU prevented mortality, though she remained hospitalised for a week.

  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) complicated by rhabdomyolysis
  presenting_complaint: Vomiting, abdominal pain, and severe muscle cramps.
  summary_of_course: An 18-year-old male presented in DKA (pH 7.05, ketones 6.2 mmol/L). During resuscitation, he complained of severe back pain, and CK was found to be 22,000 IU/L, likely due to metabolic derangement and hyperosmolality. Management required a complex balance of insulin infusion and high-volume fluid replacement to treat both DKA and rhabdomyolysis.

rhabdomyolysis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcohol-induced rhabdomyolysis
  presenting_complaint: Found unconscious with a swollen, painful left arm.
  summary_of_course: A 49-year-old male with chronic alcohol excess was found after a heavy binge, having slept on his arm for over 12 hours. He had a CK of 18,000 IU/L and a radial nerve palsy. He was treated for both rhabdomyolysis and alcohol withdrawal (Pabstine and chlordiazepoxide), with CK normalising over 5 days.

rhabdomyolysis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Snake envenomation (Vipera berus) with myolysis
  presenting_complaint: Painful limb swelling and systemic malaise following an adder bite.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old hiker was bitten on the ankle in rural Scotland. He developed significant local oedema and systemic symptoms, with a CK rise to 7,500 IU/L indicating mild rhabdomyolysis. He received European Viper Antivenom and IV fluids, resulting in rapid symptomatic improvement.

rhabdomyolysis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-ictal rhabdomyolysis
  presenting_complaint: Generalised muscle soreness following prolonged seizures.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female with refractory epilepsy experienced status epilepticus lasting 40 minutes. Post-ictally, her CK was 38,000 IU/L due to sustained muscle contractions. She was monitored closely for AKI, but with aggressive IV hydration, her creatinine remained within normal limits.

rhabdomyolysis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II) deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of dark urine triggered by fasting and infection.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old boy presented with his third episode of rhabdomyolysis (CK 52,000 IU/L) following a minor viral illness and poor oral intake. Metabolic screening and subsequent genetic testing confirmed CPT II deficiency. He was started on a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet with medium-chain triglyceride supplementation to prevent future crises.
