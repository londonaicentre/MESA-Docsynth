  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with chronic alcohol dependency was found outdoors in winter. His temperature was 30.8°C, complicated by hypoglycaemia (BM 2.1 mmol/L). He was treated with IV thiamine, dextrose, and active rewarming, with resolution of symptoms over 24 hours.

hypothermia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Perioperative hypothermia
  presenting_complaint: Shivering and delayed emergence from anaesthesia.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male underwent a prolonged 6-hour abdominal surgery. Despite use of a warming mattress, his end-of-procedure temperature was 34.5°C. He was managed in the recovery room with forced-air warming and warmed IV fluids until normothermia was achieved.

hypothermia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Neonatal hypothermia
  presenting_complaint: Poor feeding and cold to the touch.
  summary_of_course: A 2-day-old infant born at home was brought to the hospital with a rectal temperature of 35.2°C. The infant was lethargic with a weak cry and acrocyanosis. He was placed in a radiant warmer and monitored for sepsis, showing rapid improvement in thermoregulation.

hypothermia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate hypothermia in Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)
  presenting_complaint: Vomiting, abdominal pain, and altered consciousness.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male with Type 1 diabetes presented in DKA with a pH of 7.1 and a core temperature of 32.2°C. The hypothermia was attributed to peripheral vasodilation and metabolic failure. He was treated with the standard DKA protocol and gentle rewarming, achieving normothermia as the acidosis resolved.

  presenting_complaint: Found semi-naked in a wooded area.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male hiker was found in a state of undress despite sub-zero temperatures. His core temperature was 26.2°C.
