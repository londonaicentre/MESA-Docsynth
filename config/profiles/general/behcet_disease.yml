behcet_disease_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Classic Behcet Disease
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent painful oral and genital ulceration with skin rashes.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female of Turkish descent presented with a 3-year history of recurrent aphthous stomatitis and painful vulval ulcers. Clinical examination revealed erythema nodosum on the shins and a positive pathergy test. She was HLA-B51 positive and commenced on topical corticosteroids and Colchicine 600mcg BD, resulting in significant reduction in flare frequency.

behcet_disease_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Ocular Behcet Disease
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset blurred vision and bilateral eye redness.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male presented to ophthalmology with bilateral non-granulomatous posterior uveitis and retinal vasculitis. He reported a history of "canker sores" but no genital lesions. Following a multidisciplinary review, he was diagnosed with Behcet's and started on high-dose Prednisolone and Adalimumab to prevent permanent visual loss.

behcet_disease_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Neuro-Behcet Disease (Parenchymal)
  presenting_complaint: Right-sided weakness, ataxia, and personality changes.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male with known Behcet's presented with subacute neurological deficit. MRI brain showed characteristic T2-hyperintense lesions in the brainstem and basal ganglia. He was treated with intravenous Methylprednisolone pulses followed by Cyclophosphamide infusions, leading to partial recovery of motor function.

behcet_disease_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Vasculo-Behcet Disease with Pulmonary Artery Aneurysm
  presenting_complaint: Massive haemoptysis and pleuritic chest pain.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male presented in extremis to A&E with life-threatening haemoptysis. CT pulmonary angiography revealed multiple pulmonary artery aneurysms and a right lower lobe pulmonary infarct. He underwent emergency arterial embolisation and was commenced on intensive immunosuppression with Infliximab and steroids to stabilise the underlying vasculitis.

behcet_disease_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Intestinal Behcet Disease
  presenting_complaint: Chronic abdominal pain, bloody diarrhoea, and weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female was initially misdiagnosed with Crohn's disease due to ileocaecal ulceration on colonoscopy. However, the presence of recurrent genital scarring and lack of granulomas on biopsy led to a revised diagnosis of Behcet's. She achieved remission following treatment with Azathioprine and Thalidomide.

behcet_disease_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Behcet Disease
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent fevers, oral ulcers, and knee swelling.
  summary_of_course: A 9-year-old boy presented with periodic fevers and painful large-joint oligoarthritis. Extensive infectious and oncological screens were negative, but a family history of Behcet's and subsequent development of scrotal ulcers confirmed the diagnosis. He is currently well-managed on low-dose Methotrexate and Colchicine.

behcet_disease_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Neuro-Behcet Disease (Non-parenchymal)
  presenting_complaint: Severe headache, papilloedema, and vomiting.
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old female presented with signs of raised intracranial pressure. MR venography confirmed cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) involving the superior sagittal sinus. In the absence of prothrombotic risk factors but presence of oral ulcers, Behcet's was diagnosed; she was treated with anticoagulation and systemic glucocorticoids.

behcet_disease_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Behcet Disease
  presenting_complaint: Persistent oral ulceration despite multiple immunosuppressants.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male failed to respond to Colchicine, Azathioprine, and Mycophenolate Mofetil for severe mucosal disease. He experienced frequent "shattered" episodes of fatigue and debilitating ulcers. He was eventually switched to Apremilast, which provided a 70% reduction in ulcer burden and improved quality of life.

behcet_diagnosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Behcet Disease with Budd-Chiari Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal distension, jaundice, and right upper quadrant pain.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male presented with acute hepatic vein thrombosis. Investigations revealed underlying Behcet's disease as the driver of the prothrombotic state. He required a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) and long-term anticoagulation alongside aggressive immunosuppression with Infliximab.

behcet_disease_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Late-onset Behcet Disease
  presenting_complaint: New onset inflammatory back pain and skin pustules.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male presented with sacroiliitis and pseudofolliculitis. Despite his age, the combination of recurrent oral ulcers and HLA-B51 positivity supported a Behcet's diagnosis. He responded well to Sulfasalazine and topical therapies, though his recovery was complicated by pre-existing Type 2 Diabetes.

behcet_disease_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Behcet Disease with Cardiac Involvement
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath, palpitations, and chest tightness.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male with known Behcet's presented with signs of heart failure. Echocardiography revealed an intracardiac thrombus in the right ventricle and mild aortic root dilatation. He was treated with high-dose steroids and Warfarin, with subsequent resolution of the thrombus and stabilisation of the aortic diameter.

behcet_disease_012:
  primary_diagnosis: MAGIC Syndrome (Overlap)
  presenting_complaint: Painful ear cartilage inflammation and genital ulcers.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented with features of both Behcet's (mucocutaneous ulcers) and Relapsing Polychondritis (chondritis of the pinna and nose). This rare overlap, known as MAGIC syndrome, required a multi-agent regimen including Prednisolone and Tocilizumab to control systemic inflammation.

behcet_disease_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Behcet Disease with Epididymitis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent painful scrotal swelling and oral sores.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male presented to the urology clinic with recurrent sterile epididymitis. After several courses of unnecessary antibiotics, a rheumatology referral was made. Diagnosis of Behcet's was confirmed based on oral ulcers and a history of uveitis; his symptoms resolved rapidly with Colchicine.

behcet_disease_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Behcet Disease (Mucocutaneous)
  presenting_complaint: Occasional mouth ulcers and acne-like spots on the back.
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old female presented in primary care with intermittent aphthous ulcers. Examination showed papulopustular lesions on her trunk and a history of minor trauma causing skin pustules (pathergy). As she had no systemic or organ-threatening involvement, she was managed conservatively with topical lidocaine and occasional Colchicine.

behcet_disease_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Behcet Disease in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Flare of oral ulcers and arthralgia during the second trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old pregnant woman with known Behcet's experienced a moderate flare. Management was challenging due to pregnancy; she was treated with low-dose Prednisolone and continued her Azathioprine, which was deemed safe. She delivered a healthy infant at term with no neonatal Behcet's symptoms.

behcet_disease_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Behcet Disease with Deep Vein Thrombosis
  presenting_complaint: Painful swelling of the left calf and recurrent mouth ulcers.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male presented with an unprovoked DVT. Further history revealed a 5-year history of recurrent oral and genital ulceration. He was diagnosed with Behcet's-associated venous thromboembolism and started on immunosuppression rather than long-term anticoagulation alone, as per EULAR guidelines to prevent recurrence.

behcet_disease_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Behcet Disease with Large Vessel Vasculitis
  presenting_complaint: Limb claudication and absent radial pulses.
  summary_of_course: A 37-year-old female presented with "pulseless" symptoms in her left arm. Imaging showed subclavian artery stenosis and wall thickening of the thoracic aorta. Initially suspected to be Takayasu arteritis, the presence of typical Behcet's mucosal ulcers and HLA-B51 positivity confirmed the diagnosis of Vasculo-Behcet's.

behcet_disease_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Behcet Disease with Erythema Multiforme-like lesions
  presenting_complaint: Target-like skin lesions and severe oral erosions.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male presented with an acute eruption of targetoid lesions. Initially treated as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, the recurrent nature of the episodes and subsequent development of uveitis led to a Behcet's diagnosis. He required Cyclosporine to control the acute cutaneous and ocular flares.

behcet_disease_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Behcet Disease with Secondary Amyloidosis
  presenting_complaint: Progressive peripheral oedema and proteinuria.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with long-standing, poorly controlled Behcet's developed nephrotic-range proteinuria. Renal biopsy confirmed AA amyloidosis secondary to chronic inflammation. Despite starting intensive biological therapy with Infliximab, he eventually progressed to end-stage renal failure requiring haemodialysis.

behcet_disease_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Behcet Disease with CNS Haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset thunderclap headache and coma.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male with known vascular Behcet's presented with a ruptured intracranial mycotic-type aneurysm. He was admitted to the ICU for neurosurgical clipping and management of vasospasm. Post-stabilisation, his immunosuppressive regimen was intensified to include Rituximab due to the severity of his vascular involvement.
