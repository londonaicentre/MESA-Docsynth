glomerulonephritis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary Membranous Nephropathy
  presenting_complaint: Persistent ankle swelling and frothy urine
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented with nephrotic syndrome and positive anti-PLA2R antibodies (titre 1:160). Renal biopsy confirmed Stage II membranous nephropathy with subepithelial deposits. Due to high-risk features (proteinuria >8g/day), he was started on the Modified Ponticelli Regimen (alternating steroids and cyclophosphamide), resulting in clinical improvement.

  primary_diagnosis: Anti-Glomerular Basement Membrane (Anti-GBM) Disease
  presenting_complaint: Coughing up blood and extreme lethargy
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male smoker presented with Goodpasture’s syndrome, characterised by diffuse alveolar haemorrhage and crescentic glomerulonephritis. High-titre anti-GBM antibodies were detected, and biopsy showed linear IgG staining. Despite aggressive treatment with plasma exchange and cyclophosphamide, he remained dialysis-dependent but his pulmonary symptoms resolved.

glomerulonephritis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: C3 Glomerulopathy (Dense Deposit Disease)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent haematuria and declining school performance
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old boy was referred for subacute decline in GFR and persistent low C3 levels. Biopsy revealed dense, ribbon-like intramembranous deposits on electron microscopy. He showed a poor response to steroids and MMF; he was subsequently enrolled in a clinical trial for a C5 inhibitor (Eculizumab) to slow disease progression.

glomerulonephritis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: IgA Vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein Purpura)
  presenting_complaint: Purpuric rash on legs and abdominal pain
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy presented with a palpable purpuric rash on his buttocks and extensor surfaces, arthralgia, and colicky abdominal pain. Urinalysis revealed microscopic haematuria and mild proteinuria (uPCR 80 mg/mmol). He was managed with supportive care and close monitoring of renal function, which remained stable over six months.

glomerulonephritis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Alport Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Incidental haematuria and bilateral hearing loss
  summary_of_course: An 18-year-old male was investigated for persistent microscopic haematuria found during a sports medical. He had a family history of early-onset renal failure and wore hearing aids for sensorineural deafness. Genetic testing confirmed a COL4A5 mutation, and he was commenced on Ramipril to delay the progression to end-stage renal failure.

glomerulonephritis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)
  presenting_complaint: Refractory nephrotic syndrome
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old Afro-Caribbean male presented with severe oedema and proteinuria. Biopsy showed segmental scarring in 3 out of 15 glomeruli, consistent with primary FSGS (NOS variant). He proved resistant to high-dose steroids and Tacrolimus, eventually progressing to chronic kidney disease stage 5 within three years.

glomerulonephritis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Infection-Related Glomerulonephritis (Staphylococcal)
  presenting_complaint: Acute Kidney Injury following a skin infection
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with type 2 diabetes developed AKI (Creatinine 310 µmol/L) three weeks after a cellulitis episode. Biopsy showed endocapillary proliferative GN with "hump-like" subepithelial deposits and dominant IgA staining. His renal function improved significantly following targeted antibiotic therapy for the underlying infection and temporary diuretic support.

glomerulonephritis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Cryoglobulinaemic Glomerulonephritis
  presenting_complaint: Skin ulcers and joint pains
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with chronic Hepatitis C infection presented with Type II mixed cryoglobulinaemia, purpura, and low C4 levels. Renal biopsy showed a membranoproliferative pattern with "thrombi" in the capillary lumens. She was treated with Rituximab and direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy, leading to clearance of the virus and stabilisation of her renal function.

glomerulonephritis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Fibrillary Glomerulonephritis
  presenting_complaint: Unexplained proteinuria and hypertension
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female presented with non-nephrotic proteinuria and a slow rise in creatinine. Initial autoimmune screens were negative, but renal biopsy showed Congo-red negative deposits that stained for DNAJB9. This rare diagnosis was managed with ACE inhibitors, as the patient declined aggressive immunosuppression due to multiple comorbidities.

  primary_diagnosis: Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA)
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss, fever, and dark urine
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male presented with constitutional symptoms and p-ANCA (MPO) positivity. Renal biopsy showed a pauci-immune necrotising crescentic glomerulonephritis. He was treated with a reduced-dose cyclophosphamide regimen (PEXIVAS protocol) and steroids, achieving clinical remission despite his age and frailty.

glomerulonephritis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Thin Basement Membrane Nephropathy
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic microscopic haematuria
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female was referred from her GP after persistent microscopic haematuria was noted on three separate occasions. She had a normal GFR, no proteinuria, and a normal blood pressure. A family history of "benign haematuria" was noted, and a diagnosis of Thin Basement Membrane Nephropathy was made; she was reassured and discharged back to primary care for annual monitoring.

glomerulonephritis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Proliferative Glomerulonephritis with Monoclonal Immunoglobulin Deposits (PGNMID)
  presenting_complaint: Nephrotic syndrome and anaemia

  presenting_complaint: Fatigue and dark urine following a viral illness
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female presented with a nephritic-nephrotic picture and low C3 and C4. Biopsy showed "tram-tracking" of the glomerular basement membrane and subendothelial deposits. Extensive screening for secondary causes was negative, and she was started on steroids and Mycophenolate Mofetil to control the proliferative process.

glomerulonephritis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic Glomerulonephritis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of pre-existing renal failure
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with long-standing, stable IgA nephropathy (baseline Cr 180 µmol/L) presented with a sudden rise in creatinine to 450 µmol/L following a severe bout of gastroenteritis. While initially thought to be pre-renal, a repeat biopsy showed superimposed crescentic transformation. He required pulsed steroids to stabilise his GFR back to baseline.

glomerulonephritis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Preeclampsia-associated Glomerular Endotheliosis
  presenting_complaint: Severe hypertension and proteinuria in the third trimester
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old primigravida at 34 weeks gestation presented with BP 170/110 mmHg and 3+ proteinuria. Following delivery of the neonate, her proteinuria persisted for 12 weeks, prompting a renal biopsy which showed classic glomerular endotheliosis (swelling of endothelial cells). Her symptoms fully resolved by 6 months postpartum without further intervention.
