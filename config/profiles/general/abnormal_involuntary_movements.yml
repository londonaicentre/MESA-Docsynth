  primary_diagnosis: Wilson's disease
  presenting_complaint: Wing-beating tremor and jaundice
  summary_of_course: A 17-year-old male presented with a coarse proximal tremor, dysarthria, and abnormal liver function tests. Slit-lamp examination confirmed the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, and serum caeruloplasmin was low. He was commenced on penicillamine and zinc acetate, requiring long-term monitoring of copper excretion.

abnormal_involuntary_movements_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Essential tremor
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral hand tremor when holding a cup
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old female reported a long-standing postural tremor that interfered with eating and writing. The tremor improved significantly after a small glass of sherry but was otherwise progressive. She was successfully managed with propranolol, which reduced the amplitude of the tremor and improved her quality of life.

abnormal_involuntary_movements_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Hemiballismus
  presenting_complaint: Violent flinging movements of the right arm and leg
  summary_of_course: An 81-year-old male with poorly controlled hypertension presented with acute, large-amplitude flailing movements of his right-sided limbs. Brain MRI identified a small lacunar infarct in the left subthalamic nucleus. The movements were partially controlled with haloperidol and gradually subsided over several weeks.

abnormal_involuntary_movements_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Gilles de la Tourette syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Multiple motor tics and vocal grunting
  summary_of_course: An 11-year-old boy was referred for chronic eye blinking, shoulder shrugging, and throat clearing that had persisted for over 18 months. The tics fluctuated in intensity and were associated with premonitory urges. Management involved Comprehensive Behavioural Intervention for Tics (CBIT) and low-dose guanfacine for associated ADHD symptoms.

abnormal_involuntary_movements_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis
  presenting_complaint: Orofacial dyskinesia and seizures
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female presented to the ICU with psychiatric symptoms followed by prominent 'chewing' movements and autonomic instability. CSF analysis was positive for NMDA receptor antibodies, and a pelvic MRI identified an ovarian teratoma. Following tumour resection and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, her involuntary movements and cognitive status slowly improved.

abnormal_involuntary_movements_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Cervical dystonia
  presenting_complaint: Involuntary neck pulling to the left
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male presented with a 6-month history of his head rotating towards his left shoulder, accompanied by neck pain. Examination showed hypertrophy of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle. He received botulinum toxin injections every 12 weeks, which provided significant relief from the abnormal posture and pain.

abnormal_involuntary_movements_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Lance-Adams syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Action myoclonus following cardiac arrest
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male developed severe, jerky movements of his limbs whenever he attempted purposeful movement following a prolonged out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The myoclonus was absent at rest but prevented him from feeding himself. He was treated with a combination of levetiracetam and sodium valproate, which allowed for participation in neurorehabilitation.

abnormal_involuntary_movements_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Akathisia
  presenting_complaint: Intense inner restlessness and inability to sit still
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female was treated with intravenous metoclopramide for a migraine in the emergency department. Within an hour, she developed an overwhelming urge to move and was constantly pacing the cubicle. The symptoms were managed with a dose of propranolol and resolved within several hours as the medication cleared.

abnormal_involuntary_movements_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Hemifacial spasm
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent twitching of the left eye and cheek
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female reported involuntary contractions of the left side of her face, initially starting with the eyelid and progressing to the mouth. MRI with FIESTA sequences showed a vascular loop of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery compressing the facial nerve. She opted for microvascular decompression surgery, which resulted in immediate cessation of the spasms.

abnormal_involuntary_movements_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia
  presenting_complaint: Brief episodes of limb twisting triggered by sudden movement
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old boy experienced 30-second episodes of dystonic posturing of his right arm whenever he started running. There was no loss of consciousness, and interictal examination was normal. He was started on low-dose carbamazepine, which led to complete suppression of the attacks.

abnormal_involuntary_movements_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Hepatic encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Flapping tremor of the hands
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with known alcoholic cirrhosis presented with confusion and a 'flapping' tremor (asterixis) when extending his wrists. Blood tests showed significantly elevated ammonia levels. He was treated with lactulose and rifaximin to reduce nitrogenous waste, leading to the resolution of the asterixis as his mental state improved.

abnormal_involuntary_movements_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Dopa-responsive dystonia
  presenting_complaint: Progressive walking difficulty with evening worsening
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old girl developed an abnormal gait and toe-walking that was mild in the morning but severe by the afternoon. A trial of low-dose Levodopa resulted in a dramatic and sustained disappearance of all symptoms. Genetic testing later confirmed a mutation in the GCH1 gene (Segawa syndrome).
