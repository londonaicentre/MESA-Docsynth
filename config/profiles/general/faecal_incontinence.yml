faecal_incontinence_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic urge faecal incontinence
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, uncontrollable urge to defecate followed by involuntary loss of solid stool.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female presented with a 12-month history of worsening urgency. Physical examination and endoanal ultrasound showed intact sphincters, but anorectal manometry revealed rectal hypersensitivity. She was managed with loperamide, pelvic floor muscle training, and dietary modifications, resulting in a 70% reduction in episodes.

faecal_incontinence_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Traumatic obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASI)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent leakage of flatus and liquid stool since instrumental delivery three months ago.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old primiparous woman underwent a forceps delivery complicated by a grade 3b perineal tear. Despite primary repair, she developed chronic faecal incontinence; endoanal ultrasound confirmed a residual external anal sphincter defect. She was referred for secondary sphincteroplasty after failing conservative biofeedback therapy.

faecal_incontinence_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Overflow incontinence secondary to chronic constipation
  presenting_complaint: Frequent "smearing" and liquid soiling in underwear.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old male with a history of stool withholding presented with daily soiling. Abdominal palpation revealed a large faecal mass in the left iliac fossa, confirmed as severe impaction on abdominal X-ray. Treatment involved a disimpaction regimen with macrogols, followed by a long-term maintenance dose, resolving the overflow symptoms.

faecal_incontinence_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Neurogenic bowel dysfunction in Multiple Sclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent complete loss of bowel control without warning.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female with relapsing-remitting MS reported increasing episodes of passive faecal incontinence. Neurological assessment confirmed reduced anal tone and absent bulbocavernosus reflex. She was successfully transitioned to a transanal irrigation (TAI) system, which provided predictable bowel emptying and improved her quality of life.

faecal_incontinence_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Cauda Equina Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of saddle anaesthesia and loss of anal sphincter control.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male presented to A&E with severe lower back pain and sudden faecal incontinence. MRI of the lumbar spine demonstrated a large L4/L5 disc prolapse compressing the cauda equina. Emergency surgical decompression was performed, but he retained permanent moderate faecal incontinence requiring long-term containment products.

faecal_incontinence_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Radiation proctitis with associated incontinence
  presenting_complaint: Tenesmus, rectal bleeding, and frequent liquid faecal leakage.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male, two years post-radiotherapy for prostate adenocarcinoma, presented with chronic radiation proctitis. Endoscopy showed friable mucosa and telangiectasia, while manometry showed reduced rectal compliance. Management included sucralfate enemas and APC (Argon Plasma Coagulation), though mild incontinence persisted.

faecal_incontinence_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Ulcerative Colitis with urgency-related incontinence
  presenting_complaint: Bloody diarrhoea 12 times per day with frequent nocturnal incontinence.
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old male presented in an acute flare of UC (Mayo score 3). The severity of mucosal inflammation led to profound rectal urgency and inability to reach the toilet in time. Following a course of IV methylprednisolone and transition to Infliximab, the inflammation subsided and bowel continence was fully restored.

faecal_incontinence_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-surgical sphincter injury (Haemorrhoidectomy)
  presenting_complaint: Passive leakage of mucus and stool following surgical procedure.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male underwent an open haemorrhoidectomy for grade IV haemorrhoids. Post-operatively, he experienced permanent passive incontinence; investigations revealed an accidental internal anal sphincter notch. He was managed with bulking agents (PTQ injections) into the anal canal with partial symptomatic improvement.

faecal_incontinence_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Functional faecal incontinence secondary to dementia
  presenting_complaint: Inappropriate defaecation and poor hygiene in a residential care setting.
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old female with advanced Alzheimer's disease began experiencing daily faecal incontinence. Clinical review suggested a loss of cognitive awareness of rectal filling and inability to communicate the need for assistance. A scheduled toileting programme and dietary fibre optimisation were implemented to manage the frequency of accidents.

faecal_incontinence_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic autonomic neuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Nocturnal faecal incontinence and chronic diarrhoea.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with a 30-year history of Type 1 Diabetes presented with "painless" nocturnal soiling. Investigations excluded coeliac disease and IBD, while nerve conduction studies confirmed systemic neuropathy. Symptoms were attributed to impaired internal anal sphincter tone and rapid colonic transit, managed with codeine phosphate.

faecal_incontinence_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Full-thickness rectal prolapse
  presenting_complaint: Visible protrusion from the anus and constant faecal seepage.
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old female presented with a large rectal prolapse that occurred during every bowel movement. The persistent stretching of the anal sphincters resulted in severe chronic incontinence. She underwent a laparoscopic ventral rectopexy, which corrected the prolapse and significantly improved sphincter function over six months.

faecal_incontinence_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Spurious diarrhoea secondary to faecal impaction
  presenting_complaint: Paradoxical liquid stool leakage in an immobile elderly patient.
  summary_of_course: A 92-year-old bedbound patient in a nursing home developed apparent severe diarrhoea. Digital rectal examination revealed a rock-hard faecal bolus in the rectum with liquid stool bypassing the mass. Manual evacuation followed by stimulant laxatives resolved the "diarrhoea" and restored normal bowel habit.

faecal_incontinence_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Bile acid malabsorption (BAM)
  presenting_complaint: Urgent watery stools and accidents following cholecystectomy.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female reported daily watery incontinence six months after gallbladder removal. A SeHCAT scan showed 5% retention at 7 days, confirming severe BAM. Treatment with colesevelam (a bile acid sequestrant) resulted in immediate thickening of stool and cessation of incontinent episodes.

faecal_incontinence_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Congenital anorectal malformation (Post-repair)
  presenting_complaint: Life-long faecal soiling and poor bowel control.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male, born with an imperforate anus and treated with a PSARP (posterior sagittal anorectal plasty) as an infant, sought adult transition care. MRI showed hypoplastic levator muscles and anal sphincters. He was managed with a Malone Antegrade Continence Enema (MACE) procedure to achieve social continence.

faecal_incontinence_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Scleroderma-associated internal sphincter atrophy
  presenting_complaint: Passive leakage of solid stool without any sensation of rectal fullness.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female with systemic sclerosis presented with progressive passive incontinence. Endoanal ultrasound showed a characteristically thin, atrophic internal anal sphincter. Due to the systemic nature of her disease, she was treated with a sacral nerve stimulator (SNS), which provided a 50% improvement in continence scores.

faecal_incontinence_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Clostridioides difficile infection
  presenting_complaint: Acute, profuse watery diarrhoea and incontinence in a hospitalised patient.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female on broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia developed sudden-onset incontinence of liquid stool. Stool PCR was positive for C. difficile toxin. She was isolated and treated with oral vancomycin; the incontinence resolved as the underlying infection was cleared and stool consistency normalised.

faecal_incontinence_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Pelvic floor dyssynergia with secondary incontinence
  presenting_complaint: Straining to evacuate followed by subsequent leakage of retained stool.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old female presented with a "fragmented" bowel habit and post-defaecation leakage. Anorectal manometry and proctography showed paradoxical contraction of the puborectalis muscle during evacuation (anismus). She underwent a course of biofeedback therapy to retrain the pelvic floor, which successfully eliminated the post-evacuation soiling.

faecal_incontinence_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Traumatic pelvic fracture with nerve avulsion
  presenting_complaint: Complete loss of bowel and bladder control following a road traffic accident.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male sustained an unstable pelvic ring fracture and sacral nerve root avulsion. Despite orthopaedic stabilisation, he was left with a permanent flaccid anal sphincter and no rectal sensation. After failing conservative measures, he elected for a permanent end colostomy to manage his faecal incontinence.

faecal_incontinence_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Rectovaginal fistula secondary to Crohn's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Passage of faeces via the vagina and associated perineal excoriation.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old female with known perianal Crohn's presented with faecal matter leaking through the vagina. Examination under anaesthesia confirmed a complex rectovaginal fistula. She was treated with a combination of seton insertion, biologics (Adalimumab), and eventually a temporary diverting loop ileostomy to allow the tissue to heal.

faecal_incontinence_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Metformin-induced faecal incontinence
  presenting_complaint: New-onset liquid stool incontinence shortly after starting medication for Type 2 Diabetes.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male began experiencing urgent diarrhoea and two episodes of faecal incontinence after his Metformin dose was increased to 1000mg BD. There were no other red flags and physical exam was normal. Switching to a modified-release formulation and a slower dose titration resolved the gastrointestinal side effects and restored continence.
