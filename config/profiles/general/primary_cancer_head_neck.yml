  primary_diagnosis: Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (WHO Type III)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent epistaxis and unilateral hearing loss.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old male of South-East Asian descent presented with right-sided serous otitis media and blood-stained nasal discharge. Endoscopy identified a mass in the Fossa of Rosenmüller, and EBV-DNA titres were significantly elevated. He was treated with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy due to T3N2 disease.

primary_cancer_head_neck_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Advanced Hypopharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Severe dysphagia and audible stridor.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with a 50 pack-year smoking history presented as an emergency with acute airway compromise. He required an urgent awake tracheostomy before staging confirmed a T4a tumour involving the pyriform sinus with laryngeal invasion. Given his frailty and comorbidities, he was managed with palliative radiotherapy and a gastrostomy for nutrition.

primary_cancer_head_neck_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma of the Parotid Gland
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly growing lump in front of the left ear and facial weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female presented with a firm parotid mass and associated House-Brackmann Grade III facial nerve palsy. Imaging showed a high-grade tumour infiltrating the masseter muscle. She underwent a radical parotidectomy with sacrifice of the facial nerve and post-operative adjuvant radiotherapy.

primary_cancer_head_neck_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Maxillary Sinus
  presenting_complaint: Unilateral nasal obstruction and cheek numbness.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male was initially treated for chronic sinusitis before developing facial asymmetry and proptosis. CT imaging revealed a large mass eroding the anterior wall of the maxilla and the orbital floor. He underwent a total maxillectomy with orbital exenteration and free-flap reconstruction.

primary_cancer_head_neck_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Floor of Mouth
  presenting_complaint: Large fungating sublingual mass and difficulty speaking.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with heavy alcohol consumption and COPD presented with a T3 lesion involving the ventral tongue and mandible. Due to poor pulmonary function, he was deemed high-risk for major surgery. He received primary radiotherapy but unfortunately developed osteoradionecrosis of the mandible six months post-treatment.

primary_cancer_head_neck_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Supraglottic Squamous Cell Carcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Persistent "hot potato" voice and referred otalgia.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female smoker presented with a muffled voice and persistent right ear pain despite normal ear examination. Laryngoscopy showed a large epiglottic tumour extending to the pre-epiglottic space. She underwent a total laryngectomy and bilateral neck dissections after failing to respond to initial chemotherapy.

primary_cancer_head_neck_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Unknown Primary (CUP)
  presenting_complaint: Cystic swelling in the upper lateral neck.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male presented with what was initially suspected to be a branchial cyst. Excisional biopsy revealed SCC within a lymph node, but panendoscopy, PET-CT, and bilateral tonsillectomy failed to identify a primary site. He was managed with a comprehensive neck dissection and mucosal irradiation to the pharyngeal axis.

primary_cancer_head_neck_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma of the Hard Palate
  presenting_complaint: Slowly enlarging, painful lump on the roof of the mouth.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented with a firm, minor salivary gland tumour that had been present for a year. MRI suggested perineural invasion along the greater palatine nerve. Following wide local excision, histology confirmed positive margins, necessitating adjuvant radiotherapy to the skull base.

primary_cancer_head_neck_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral neck lymphadenopathy and nasal congestion.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old boy presented with large, painless cervical nodes that did not respond to antibiotics. Biopsy confirmed undifferentiated NPC, which is rare in this age group but highly sensitive to treatment. He achieved a complete response following a paediatric-specific protocol of cisplatin-based chemotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy.

primary_cancer_head_neck_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Return of hoarseness and new-onset cough.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male who previously underwent radiotherapy for a T2 glottic tumour presented with local recurrence 18 months later. Biopsy confirmed recurrent SCC, and he underwent a salvage total laryngectomy. Post-operative recovery was complicated by a pharyngocutaneous fistula requiring prolonged conservative management.

primary_cancer_head_neck_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Polymorphous Adenocarcinoma of the Minor Salivary Glands
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic firm swelling in the buccal mucosa.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female was referred by her dentist after a lesion was noted during a routine check-up. The tumour was indolent and non-ulcerated. She underwent wide local excision with clear margins and has remained disease-free for three years, reflecting the generally low-grade nature of this malignancy.

primary_cancer_head_neck_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Advanced Base of Tongue Squamous Cell Carcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Severe throat pain, weight loss, and trismus.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male presented with cachexia and an inability to open his mouth fully due to pterygoid muscle invasion. Imaging showed a T4b tumour with carotid artery encasement. Given the unresectable nature and patient frailty, he was transitioned to a palliative care pathway focusing on pain control and symptom relief.

primary_cancer_head_neck_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Lower Lip
  presenting_complaint: Chronic crusting sore on the lip that bleeds occasionally.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old retired farmer with significant sun exposure presented with a 1.5cm lesion on the vermilion border. A wedge resection was performed under local anaesthetic, confirming a well-differentiated SCC with clear margins. No adjuvant treatment was required, and the cosmetic outcome was excellent.

primary_cancer_head_neck_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly enlarging neck mass over two weeks causing breathlessness.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old female presented with a "rock-hard" thyroid mass and new-onset vocal cord palsy. CT showed tracheal compression and pulmonary metastases. Despite emergency debulking and palliative radiotherapy, the disease progressed rapidly, and the patient passed away four weeks after diagnosis.

primary_cancer_head_neck_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Buccal Mucosa
  presenting_complaint: Painful white and red patch in the cheek that has become a lump.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female of South Asian origin with a history of betel nut chewing presented with a T2 lesion. Examination revealed significant oral submucous fibrosis, making surgical access difficult. She underwent a resection with a radial forearm free-flap reconstruction to address the defect and improve mouth opening.

primary_cancer_head_neck_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Carcinoma Ex-Pleomorphic Adenoma of the Submandibular Gland
  presenting_complaint: Sudden rapid growth of a long-standing neck lump.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male had a stable submandibular mass for 15 years which suddenly tripled in size over two months. Histology after submandibular gland excision revealed an aggressive carcinoma arising within a benign pleomorphic adenoma. He required adjuvant radiotherapy due to the high-grade features and extra-capsular spread.

primary_cancer_head_neck_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma with Skull Base Extension
  presenting_complaint: Double vision and severe unilateral headache.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male presented with a sixth cranial nerve palsy and persistent hemicrania. MRI demonstrated a nasopharyngeal primary invading the cavernous sinus and clivus (T4 disease). He was managed in a tertiary centre with intensive induction chemotherapy followed by high-dose radiotherapy, showing partial regression on follow-up imaging.
