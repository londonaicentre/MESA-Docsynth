eczema_herpeticum_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Eczema herpeticum
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of atopic dermatitis with painful, "punched-out" erosions and high fever.
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old boy with a history of severe atopic dermatitis presented with a 48-hour history of monomorphic vesicles and erosions on his face and neck. Clinical examination revealed lymphadenopathy and a temperature of 39.2°C; swabs confirmed HSV-1. He was admitted for a 5-day course of IV aciclovir and supportive skin care, resulting in rapid crusting and resolution.

eczema_herpeticum_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Eczema herpeticum with secondary staphylococcal infection
  presenting_complaint: Spreading painful rash on the trunk and limbs with yellow crusting.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female with poorly controlled eczema presented with acute-on-chronic skin breakdown. Examination showed classic EH erosions alongside honey-coloured crusting suggestive of secondary impetiginisation. Skin swabs grew both HSV-2 and Staphylococcus aureus; she was treated with oral aciclovir and flucloxacillin as an outpatient with close dermatology follow-up.

eczema_herpeticum_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Ophthalmic eczema herpeticum
  presenting_complaint: Periorbital swelling, vesicles on eyelids, and a gritty sensation in the right eye.
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old girl with facial eczema developed clusters of vesicles around her right eye. Urgent ophthalmology review confirmed dendritic ulceration on the cornea alongside cutaneous EH. She received IV aciclovir and topical ganciclovir, preventing permanent visual impairment despite significant initial inflammation.

eczema_herpeticum_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe eczema herpeticum with systemic involvement
  presenting_complaint: Widespread blistering rash, lethargy, and reduced oral intake.
  summary_of_course: An 8-month-old infant was admitted to the paediatric HDU with disseminated EH covering 40% of his body surface area. He was clinically dehydrated with signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Following aggressive fluid resuscitation and a 10-day course of IV aciclovir, his skin healed without scarring, though he required nutritional support via NG tube.

eczema_herpeticum_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent eczema herpeticum
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of painful facial erosions every 3 months.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male student reported his fourth episode of EH in a single year, usually triggered by exam stress. Despite prompt treatment with oral aciclovir during flares, the frequency remained high. He was started on long-term suppressive aciclovir (400mg BD), which successfully prevented further recurrences over the following 12 months.

eczema_herpeticum_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Eczema herpeticum on Darier's disease
  presenting_complaint: Malodorous, painful erosions in intertriginous areas.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old woman with known Darier's disease presented with an acute flare of her skin condition that was unresponsive to topical steroids. Viral PCR swabs from the axilla and groin confirmed HSV-1, indicating EH (Kaposi varicelliform eruption) on a non-atopic substrate. She required hospitalisation for IV aciclovir and potassium permanganate soaks to manage the extensive erosions.

eczema_herpetic_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Eczema herpeticum mimicking contact dermatitis
  presenting_complaint: Itchy, weeping rash on the neck following use of a new scarf.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old woman initially suspected allergic contact dermatitis, but the rash failed to respond to potent topical corticosteroids. On day 5, the lesions became characteristically umbilicated and painful. A diagnosis of EH was made via PCR, and she was switched from steroids to oral aciclovir, leading to prompt clinical improvement.

eczema_herpeticum_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Eczema herpeticum in an immunocompromised patient
  presenting_complaint: Non-healing, deep ulcerations on the lower limbs.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with HIV (CD4 count 150 cells/mm³) and chronic eczema presented with persistent, deep skin erosions. Biopsy and PCR confirmed chronic EH, which was relatively resistant to initial aciclovir therapy. He eventually responded to a prolonged course of foscarnet and optimisation of his antiretroviral therapy.

eczema_herpeticum_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Eczema herpeticum following cosmetic procedure
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly spreading vesicles on the face 48 hours after microneedling.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old woman with a history of mild childhood eczema underwent a microneedling procedure for acne scarring. Two days later, she developed widespread monomorphic vesicles across the treated area. She was diagnosed with EH and treated with oral valaciclovir, highlighting the risk of viral inoculation during aesthetic procedures in patients with a history of atopy.

eczema_herpeticum_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Eczema herpeticum with secondary cellulitis
  presenting_complaint: Painful rash on the arm with spreading redness and heat.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy with flexural eczema presented with EH on his left antecubital fossa. Over 24 hours, he developed ascending erythema and warmth extending to the shoulder, with a raised CRP of 85 mg/L. He was treated for both EH and secondary streptococcal cellulitis with IV aciclovir and flucloxacillin, requiring a 7-day hospital stay.

eczema_herpeticum_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Eczema herpeticum during pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Painful, blistering rash on the chest and neck in the third trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old pregnant woman (34 weeks gestation) presented with acute EH. Due to the risk of neonatal transmission and maternal morbidity, she was admitted for monitoring and started on oral aciclovir. The lesions resolved within 10 days, and she subsequently had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery with no evidence of neonatal HSV infection.

eczema_herpeticum_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild eczema herpeticum
  presenting_complaint: Small cluster of painful "cold sores" spreading on an eczematous patch.
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old girl with mild atopic dermatitis presented with a localized cluster of 10-15 umbilicated vesicles on her left cheek. She remained systemically well and afebrile. She was treated with a 7-day course of oral aciclovir suspension in the community, with full resolution and no further spread.

eczema_herpeticum_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Eczema herpeticum with HSV viraemia
  presenting_complaint: Widespread rash, high fever, and altered mental status.
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old boy was brought to A&E with extensive EH and acute confusion. Lumbar puncture was negative for encephalitis, but blood PCR was positive for HSV-1 viraemia. He was treated with high-dose IV aciclovir for 14 days and required intensive monitoring for multi-organ involvement, eventually making a full recovery.

eczema_herpeticum_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Eczema herpeticum in an elderly patient
  presenting_complaint: Painful, erosive rash on the legs and torso.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old man with late-onset atopic dermatitis and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) developed widespread EH. His presentation was atypical due to his age and underlying malignancy, initially being mistaken for a bullous pemphigoid flare. Once PCR confirmed HSV, he was treated with IV aciclovir, though his recovery was prolonged due to his underlying immunosuppression.

eczema_herpeticum_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Eczema herpeticum triggered by sun exposure
  presenting_complaint: Sudden flare of facial eczema with painful blisters after a beach holiday.
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old male with a history of AD reported a severe flare following intense UV exposure. Examination showed classic monomorphic erosions of EH across the malar region. He was treated with valaciclovir 1g TDS for 7 days, and advised on the importance of sun protection as a preventive measure for future HSV triggers.

eczema_herpeticum_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Eczema herpeticum with treatment failure
  presenting_complaint: Worsening skin erosions despite 72 hours of oral aciclovir.
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old girl was initially prescribed oral aciclovir for EH but returned with worsening pain and new vesicles. She was admitted for IV aciclovir due to concerns about poor oral absorption or resistance. Subsequent viral culture showed sensitivity to aciclovir, suggesting that the initial failure was due to disease severity exceeding oral bioavailability.

eczema_herpeticum_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Eczema herpeticum on Psoriasis (Kaposi Varicelliform Eruption)
  presenting_complaint: Acute, painful erosions within stable psoriasis plaques.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old man with plaque psoriasis, currently on methotrexate, developed sudden-onset painful vesicles within his psoriatic lesions. This rare presentation of EH on a non-atopic substrate was confirmed by PCR. Methotrexate was temporarily paused, and he was treated with IV aciclovir, leading to resolution of the viral infection within 2 weeks.

eczema_herpeticum_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Eczema herpeticum with lymphoedema
  presenting_complaint: Severe swelling of the lower legs with weeping, punched-out sores.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old woman with chronic venous eczema and secondary lymphoedema developed EH. The extensive viral infection triggered a significant inflammatory response, worsening her limb oedema and leading to a secondary bacterial infection. She required elevation, IV aciclovir, and long-term compression therapy once the acute infection had subsided.

eczema_herpeticum_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Eczema herpeticum masquerading as a steroid flare
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly worsening eczema despite increasing topical steroid potency.
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old boy's eczema appeared to flare, and his parents were advised to use Dermovate. This exacerbated the underlying (unrecognised) HSV infection, leading to rapid dissemination of EH. The diagnosis was made when he presented to the emergency department with systemic symptoms; steroids were stopped and IV aciclovir initiated immediately.

eczema_herpeticum_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Eczema herpeticum in a healthcare worker
  presenting_complaint: Painful vesicles on the hands and forearms.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old nurse with hand eczema developed EH after caring for a patient with an active HSV lesion. The infection was localized to the areas of broken skin on her hands but was extremely painful, preventing her from working. She was treated with oral valaciclovir and required a three-week period of absence from clinical duties until the lesions were fully epithelialised.
