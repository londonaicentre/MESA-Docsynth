  presenting_complaint: Multiple purple, raised skin nodules on a chronically swollen arm.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old female with a 20-year history of severe post-mastectomy lymphoedema presented with new-onset cutaneous lesions. Skin biopsy confirmed lymphangiosarcoma, a rare and aggressive malignancy arising in chronic lymphoedema. Despite palliative radiotherapy, the prognosis remained poor due to the extent of local infiltration.

lymphoedema_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Meige disease (Lipoedema-lymphoedema)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive swelling of both legs starting at puberty.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female reported gradual enlargement of her lower limbs since age 13, which had recently worsened. Examination revealed bilateral, non-pitting oedema extending to the toes (Stemmer's sign positive) and associated lipoedema of the thighs. She was managed with a combination of weight management advice, circular-knit compression hosiery, and long-term skin care to prevent breakdown.

lymphoedema_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Phlebo-lymphoedema
  presenting_complaint: Chronic leg swelling with skin discolouration and weeping.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with chronic venous insufficiency and multiple previous DVTs presented with worsening "woody" induration of the lower calves. Lymphoscintigraphy demonstrated impaired lymphatic drainage alongside venous reflux. He was treated with multilayer inelastic bandages (MLLB) to reduce volume before transitioning to flat-knit compression garments.

lymphoedema_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Head and neck lymphoedema
  presenting_complaint: Facial swelling and difficulty swallowing following oncological treatment.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male presented six months after completing radiotherapy and neck dissection for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Internal and external lymphoedema was noted, affecting speech and swallowing mechanics. He was managed by a multidisciplinary team including a speech and language therapist and a lymphoedema specialist for manual lymphatic drainage.

  presenting_complaint: Massive, disfiguring swelling of the left leg with thickened, folded skin.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male who recently migrated from a tropical region presented with Stage III lymphoedema and extensive lymphostatic verrucosis. Serology was positive for Wuchereria bancrofti antibodies, and he was treated with diethylcarbamazine. Intensive skin hygiene and long-term compression therapy were initiated to manage the significant skin changes and prevent secondary fungal infections.

lymphoedema_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Pelvic malignancy-associated lymphoedema
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressing swelling of the right leg and groin pain.
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old female with a history of cervical cancer presented with subacute unilateral leg swelling. Urgent CT imaging revealed recurrent pelvic lymphadenopathy compressing the iliac lymphatic chains. While the primary focus was palliative chemotherapy, she received light compression for symptom relief and limb heaviness.

lymphoedema_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Lymphoedema-distichiasis syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Lower limb swelling and irritation of the eyes.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male presented with bilateral leg oedema and a history of double rows of eyelashes (distichiasis). Genetic testing confirmed a FOXC2 mutation, and echocardiography was performed to rule out associated cardiac defects. Management focused on lifelong compression and regular ophthalmology reviews to manage corneal irritation.

lymphoedema_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Obesity-induced lymphoedema
  presenting_complaint: Massive localized swelling of the medial thighs interfering with mobility.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with a BMI of 54 presented with large, pendulous masses on the inner thighs, characteristic of massive localized lymphoedema (MLL). MRI confirmed the diagnosis and excluded liposarcoma. He was referred for bariatric surgery and specialist weight management as a prerequisite for surgical debulking of the lymphatic masses.

lymphoedema_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-traumatic lymphoedema
  presenting_complaint: Persistent swelling of the left hand following a severe crush injury.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male developed chronic swelling six months after significant soft tissue trauma and multiple surgeries to his forearm. Lymphoscintigraphy showed localized lymphatic interruption at the site of the scar tissue. He was treated with custom-made compression gloves and scar tissue massage, showing moderate improvement in hand function.

lymphoedema_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Lymphostatic verrucosis (secondary to chronic lymphoedema)
  presenting_complaint: Warty growths and foul-smelling discharge from a swollen foot.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female with long-standing, poorly managed lymphoedema presented with hyperkeratotic skin changes and lymphorrhoea (leaking lymph). Treatment involved intensive skin debridement, antimicrobial washes, and specialized padding within multilayer bandages to dry the area. Once the skin condition stabilized, she was moved to high-pressure flat-knit hosiery.

lymphoedema_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic lymphoedema post-inguinal hernia repair
  presenting_complaint: New onset of scrotal and right thigh swelling.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male reported swelling three weeks after a complex inguinal hernia repair involving mesh. Clinical assessment suggested accidental damage to the inguinal lymphatic vessels during the procedure. He was managed conservatively with scrotal support and thigh-high compression, with gradual resolution over six months as collateral lymphatic pathways developed.

lymphoedema_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary lymphoedema tarda
  presenting_complaint: Unilateral swelling of the left leg starting at age 40.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female presented with late-onset primary lymphoedema (lymphoedema tarda) with no identifiable secondary cause. Investigations, including pelvic ultrasound and lymphoscintigraphy, confirmed delayed lymphatic transport in the left leg. She responded well to a maintenance regime of Class 3 compression stockings and daily skin care.

lymphoedema_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Chylous reflux syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Milky fluid leaking from the skin of the labia and upper thigh.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female presented with chronic pelvic lymphoedema and the presence of chylous vesicles on the skin surface. Analysis of the fluid confirmed a high triglyceride content, indicating chylous reflux from the thoracic duct or cisterna chyli. She was managed with a low-fat, medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) diet and specialized compression garments to reduce intra-abdominal pressure.

lymphoedema_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Lymphoedema with recurrent erysipelas
  presenting_complaint: Frequent episodes of painful, red skin rashes and high fevers.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male with chronic lymphoedema of the right leg suffered five episodes of erysipelas in twelve months. Despite standard compression, the infections continued to recur, further damaging the lymphatic system. He was started on long-term prophylactic penicillin V (250mg twice daily), which successfully reduced the frequency of admissions.

lymphoedema_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Palliative lymphoedema in end-stage renal failure
  presenting_complaint: Severe, painful swelling of all four limbs in a bedbound patient.
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old male with multi-organ failure and hypoalbuminaemia developed generalized lymphoedema. Management focused on comfort rather than volume reduction, using light tubular bandages and limb elevation. Gentle massage was used for symptom relief, acknowledging the limited prognosis due to his comorbidities.

lymphoedema_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Turner syndrome-associated lymphoedema
  presenting_complaint: Persistent puffiness of the hands and feet in a young girl.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old girl with a known 45,X karyotype presented with characteristic peripheral lymphoedema. The swelling was relatively stable but required larger shoe sizes and soft compression socks. She was monitored for worsening symptoms during growth spurts and managed within a specialist paediatric endocrine and lymphatic clinic.

lymphoedema_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory lymphoedema post-melanoma treatment
  presenting_complaint: Severe leg swelling that fails to respond to standard compression.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male underwent wide local excision and inguinal lymph node dissection for malignant melanoma. His lymphoedema proved refractory to standard complex decongestive therapy, with persistent volume rebound. He was subsequently referred for a lymphatic-venous anastomosis (LVA) microsurgical procedure, which resulted in a 30% reduction in limb volume and improved garment compliance.
