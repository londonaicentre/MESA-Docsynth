  primary_diagnosis: Acute infective exacerbation of COPD
  presenting_complaint: Increased breathlessness and change in sputum colour
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old heavy smoker with known Gold Stage III COPD presented with a 48-hour history of increased dyspnoea and purulent sputum. Arterial blood gas showed compensated Type 2 respiratory failure.

  primary_diagnosis: Pertussis (Whooping Cough)
  presenting_complaint: Paroxysmal coughing fits followed by an inspiratory "whoop"
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old healthcare worker presented with a 4-week history of cough so severe it caused post-tussive vomiting. Despite being previously vaccinated, PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab confirmed Bordetella pertussis.

  primary_diagnosis: Necrotising pneumonia
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive dyspnoea and frank haemoptysis
  summary_of_course: A 20-year-old previously healthy female developed life-threatening pneumonia following a viral prodrome. Imaging showed multiple small cavities within areas of consolidation, and blood cultures were positive for Panton-Valentine Leucocidin (PVL) producing Staphylococcus aureus. She required emergency ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) and a combination of linezolid and clindamycin.

lower_respiratory_tract_infection_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis
  presenting_complaint: Fever and pleuritic chest pain in an immunocompromised patient
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male undergoing chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia developed a persistent fever despite broad-spectrum antibiotics.

  primary_diagnosis: Secondary bacterial pneumonia following Influenza A
  presenting_complaint: Initial improvement in flu symptoms followed by sudden relapse with high fever
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old female was recovering from confirmed Influenza A when she suddenly deteriorated on day 6 with new-onset rigors and purulent sputum. CXR showed a new dense lobar consolidation. Sputum culture grew Streptococcus pneumoniae, and she required hospitalisation for intravenous benzylpenicillin due to the severity of the secondary infection.

lower_respiratory_tract_infection_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent lower respiratory tract infections
  presenting_complaint: Frequent episodes of chest infections requiring multiple antibiotic courses
  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old boy with a history of six chest infections in the last year was referred for immunological workup. Investigations revealed a selective IgA deficiency and low IgG2 subclass levels. He was managed with a personalised chest physiotherapy plan and prophylactic low-dose azithromycin three times weekly to reduce the frequency of future infections.
