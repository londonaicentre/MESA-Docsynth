in_situ_neoplasm_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic; detected on routine screening mammography.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female presented following a screening mammogram showing a 15mm cluster of pleomorphic microcalcifications in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. Stereotactic core biopsy confirmed high-grade DCIS with comedonecrosis. She underwent a wide local excision and subsequent adjuvant radiotherapy; margins were clear, and she remains under annual mammographic surveillance.

in_situ_neoplasm_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III (CIN 3)
  presenting_complaint: Abnormal cervical screening result (high-risk HPV positive with severe dyskaryosis).
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female smoker presented to the colposcopy clinic following her first cervical screen. Colposcopic assessment revealed a large area of dense acetowhite epithelium with mosaicism involving the transformation zone. A large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) was performed under local anaesthetic, confirming CIN 3 with clear margins, and she is scheduled for a test of cure in six months.

in_situ_neoplasm_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Bowen's disease (Squamous cell carcinoma in situ)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent, non-healing scaly patch on the lower left leg.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male with chronic venous insufficiency presented with a 2cm erythematous, well-circumscribed scaly plaque on his shin, initially treated as discoid eczema with topical steroids without improvement. A punch biopsy confirmed Bowen's disease. Due to poor wound healing on the lower limb, he was treated with photodynamic therapy (PDT) rather than excision, resulting in complete clinical resolution after two sessions.

in_situ_neoplasm_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the urinary bladder
  presenting_complaint: Irritative voiding symptoms and intermittent microscopic haematuria.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male smoker presented with frequency and urgency; flexible cystoscopy revealed diffuse velvety erythematous patches on the bladder wall. Transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) and multiple biopsies confirmed high-grade flat carcinoma in situ. He commenced a six-week course of intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy and remains under close cystoscopic surveillance due to the high risk of progression.

in_situ_neoplasm_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Lentigo maligna (Melanoma in situ)
  presenting_complaint: Slowly enlarging, irregularly pigmented macule on the right cheek.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with significant lifetime sun exposure presented with a 3cm variegated brown patch on her face that had been growing for several years. An incisional biopsy confirmed lentigo maligna. She underwent staged excision (Mohs micrographic surgery) to ensure clear margins while preserving facial aesthetics, followed by a local skin flap reconstruction.

in_situ_neoplasm_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia, usual type (uVIN)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic vulval pruritus and soreness for 18 months.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented with persistent itching that was refractory to topical antifungal treatments. Examination showed multifocal white and pigmented plaques on the labia majora. Biopsies confirmed VIN 3 (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). She was treated with topical imiquimod cream for 12 weeks, achieving a partial response, followed by surgical excision of the remaining symptomatic areas.

in_situ_neoplasm_007:
  primary_diagnosis: High-grade dysplasia in Barrett's oesophagus
  presenting_complaint: Worsening dyspepsia and known history of Barrett's oesophagus.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with a 10-year history of Barrett's underwent routine surveillance endoscopy which identified a nodular area within the Barrett's segment. Histopathology from an endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) confirmed high-grade dysplasia (carcinoma in situ). He subsequently underwent radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the remaining Barrett's mucosa to prevent progression to invasive adenocarcinoma.

in_situ_neoplasm_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Laryngeal carcinoma in situ
  presenting_complaint: Persistent hoarseness of voice for three months.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male, heavy smoker, was referred to ENT with dysphonia. Microlaryngoscopy revealed a white leukoplakic lesion on the anterior third of the left true vocal cord. Excisional biopsy using a CO2 laser confirmed carcinoma in situ with no evidence of invasion. He has since ceased smoking and his voice has significantly improved, with regular follow-up via fibreoptic nasendoscopy.

in_situ_neoplasm_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade III (AIN 3)
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic; detected during high-resolution anoscopy (HRA).
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old HIV-positive male underwent screening HRA as part of a high-risk surveillance programme. Lugol's iodine-negative areas were identified in the anal canal, and biopsies confirmed AIN 3. He was treated with infrared coagulation (IRC) in the outpatient setting and remains on a six-monthly surveillance schedule to monitor for recurrence or progression.

in_situ_neoplasm_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) of the lung
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding on CT thorax performed for unrelated chest trauma.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old never-smoker was found to have a 12mm pure ground-glass opacification (GGO) in the right upper lobe. Follow-up imaging at six months showed the lesion remained stable, but a PET-CT was non-avid. A video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) wedge resection was performed, and histopathology confirmed adenocarcinoma in situ (formerly bronchioloalveolar carcinoma), which is curative with surgical resection.

in_situ_neoplasm_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Oral carcinoma in situ (Erythroplakia)
  presenting_complaint: Painless red patch on the floor of the mouth.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male who consumes high levels of alcohol and tobacco presented to his dentist with a 1cm velvety red lesion. Urgent referral to oral surgery and subsequent incisional biopsy confirmed high-grade epithelial dysplasia/carcinoma in situ. The lesion was widely excised with a CO2 laser, and the patient was enrolled in an intensive smoking and alcohol cessation programme.

in_situ_neoplasm_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Gastric carcinoma in situ (Early gastric cancer)
  presenting_complaint: Vague epigastric pain and early satiety.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female underwent an OGD which revealed a 2cm flat, slightly depressed lesion (Type IIc) in the gastric antrum. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) was performed, and the specimen confirmed high-grade mucosal dysplasia/carcinoma in situ with clear lateral and deep margins. This endoscopic approach avoided the need for a formal gastrectomy, and she remains well.

in_situ_neoplasm_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Penile intraepithelial neoplasia (PeIN)
  presenting_complaint: Red, velvety lesion on the glans penis (Erythroplasia of Queyrat).
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old uncircumcised male presented with a persistent, well-defined red plaque on the glans that failed to respond to topical steroids or antifungals. Biopsy confirmed high-grade PeIN. He was treated with topical 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) cream for six weeks, resulting in significant inflammation followed by complete clinical resolution of the lesion.

in_situ_neoplasm_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)
  presenting_complaint: Grittiness and a visible "fleshy" growth on the surface of the right eye.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male presented with a gelatinous, limbal-based lesion extending 3mm onto the cornea. Slit-lamp examination and subsequent excisional biopsy with "no-touch" technique and cryotherapy to the margins confirmed high-grade CIN. Post-operative topical Mitomycin C drops were administered to reduce the risk of recurrence, and the ocular surface remains clear at one year.

in_situ_neoplasm_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Paget's disease of the breast (In situ)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic eczematous-like changes and crusting of the left nipple.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female was treated for six months for presumed nipple eczema with no improvement. A punch biopsy of the nipple-areolar complex revealed large, pale-staining Paget cells within the epidermis, and subsequent mammography identified an underlying area of DCIS. She underwent a skin-sparing mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy, which showed no invasive disease.

in_situ_neoplasm_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Biliary intraepithelial neoplasia grade III (BilIN-3)
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice and pruritus in a patient with known Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC).
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female with long-standing PSC presented with a new dominant stricture in the common hepatic duct on MRCP. ERCP with brush cytology was suspicious for malignancy, and subsequent targeted biopsies confirmed BilIN-3 (carcinoma in situ of the bile duct). Given the high risk of progression to cholangiocarcinoma in the setting of PSC, she was referred for liver transplant assessment.

in_situ_neoplasm_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (PanIN-3)
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding in a surgical specimen.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male underwent a distal pancreatectomy for a suspected branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). While the primary lesion was a low-grade IPMN, the surrounding pancreatic parenchyma showed multifocal high-grade PanIN-3. This finding necessitated closer surveillance of the remaining pancreatic remnant using annual EUS and MRCP to monitor for new lesions.

in_situ_neoplasm_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Colorectal carcinoma in situ (Intramucosal carcinoma)
  presenting_complaint: Positive Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) via national screening.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old asymptomatic female underwent colonoscopy which identified a 30mm sessile polyp in the caecum (Paris class Is). The lesion was removed via piecemeal endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). Histopathology confirmed a tubulovillous adenoma with focal areas of intramucosal carcinoma (carcinoma in situ); as the lesion did not breach the muscularis mucosae, it carries no metastatic potential, and she is scheduled for a site-check endoscopy in six months.

in_situ_neoplasm_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN)
  presenting_complaint: Post-menopausal bleeding (PMB) for two weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old female with a BMI of 34 presented with a single episode of PMB. Transvaginal ultrasound showed an endometrial thickness of 12mm, and a Pipelle biopsy demonstrated crowded, complex glands with cytological atypia, diagnostic of EIN. She underwent a total laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy; the final pathology confirmed EIN with no evidence of invasive endometrioid adenocarcinoma.

in_situ_neoplasm_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Duodenal carcinoma in situ
  presenting_complaint: Iron deficiency anaemia and positive occult blood.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female underwent an OGD for investigation of anaemia, which revealed a 15mm flat, granular lesion in the second part of the duodenum. Biopsies showed high-grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ. Due to the location near the ampulla of Vater, she underwent a complex endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), which successfully removed the lesion with clear margins, avoiding the morbidity of a Whipple's procedure.
