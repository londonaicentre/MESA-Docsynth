  primary_diagnosis: Incidental Pulmonary Embolism
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic; found on staging scan
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old male undergoing staging CT for newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma of the lung was found to have a thrombus in the left upper lobe pulmonary artery. He denied any respiratory symptoms or chest pain. Given the malignancy, he was commenced on long-term therapeutic LMWH as per local oncological venous thromboembolism (VTE) guidelines.

pulmonary_embolism_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Septic Pulmonary Embolism
  presenting_complaint: Fever, cough, and pleuritic pain
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old intravenous drug user presented with pyrexia and respiratory distress. CT chest showed multiple peripheral cavitating nodules, and echocardiography confirmed tricuspid valve endocarditis. He was treated with a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics and anticoagulation, though the latter was complicated by minor haemoptysis.

pulmonary_embolism_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute Pulmonary Embolism
  presenting_complaint: Persistent cough and mild hypoxia
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with dementia presented with a one-week history of "not being herself" and a dry cough. Initial treatment for lower respiratory tract infection failed to improve her oxygen requirements (91% on room air). A CTPA eventually revealed multiple small subsegmental emboli, and she was started on rivaroxaban.

pulmonary_embolism_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Fat Embolism Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Confusion and petechial rash following trauma
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male sustained a comminuted femoral fracture in a road traffic accident. Twelve hours post-injury, he became increasingly confused with a GCS of 12, developed a petechial rash on his axilla, and required 60% oxygen. Diagnosis was made clinically; he received supportive care in the ICU with mechanical ventilation until the fat emboli resolved.

pulmonary_embolism_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent Pulmonary Embolism on Anticoagulation
  presenting_complaint: New onset dyspnoea while taking apixaban
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with a history of unprovoked PE six months prior presented with new pleuritic pain despite strict adherence to apixaban. CTPA confirmed a new thrombus in the right middle lobe. Investigation for underlying malignancy was negative, but he tested positive for Antiphospholipid Syndrome and was switched from a DOAC to warfarin with a target INR of 2.5-3.5.

pulmonary_embolism_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Pulmonary Embolism with Pulmonary Infarction
  presenting_complaint: Haemoptysis and sharp chest pain
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female on the combined oral contraceptive pill presented with coughing up bright red blood. CXR showed a peripheral wedge-shaped opacity (Hampton's hump), and CTPA confirmed a distal pulmonary artery occlusion with associated lung infarction. She was treated with rivaroxaban and advised to discontinue oestrogen-containing contraception.

pulmonary_embolism_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic Pulmonary Embolism
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of baseline breathlessness
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with known CTEPH presented with an acute increase in oxygen requirements. CTPA showed fresh thrombus in the right main pulmonary artery superimposed on chronic eccentric calcified wall thickening. He was stabilised with an unfractionated heparin infusion and his long-term anticoagulation strategy was reviewed.

pulmonary_embolism_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Pulmonary Embolism presenting as Syncope
  presenting_complaint: Transient loss of consciousness
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male was brought to A&E after fainting while walking. He had no prodromal symptoms but was found to be tachycardic (115 bpm) and tachypnoeic. ECG showed an S1Q3T3 pattern, and CTPA confirmed extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli despite the absence of chest pain or cough.

  primary_diagnosis: Provoked Pulmonary Embolism (Travel-related)
  presenting_complaint: Calf swelling followed by breathlessness
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented after a 14-hour flight from Singapore with a painful, swollen left leg and mild dyspnoea. Wells score was high, and CTPA confirmed a small PE in the left lower lobe. He was treated with a three-month course of apixaban and advised on VTE prophylaxis for future long-haul travel.

pulmonary_embolism_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Pulmonary Embolism in Advanced Malignancy
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly worsening hypoxia and fatigue
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer was admitted with severe lethargy and an oxygen saturation of 88%. CTPA showed multiple bilateral peripheral emboli. Given his poor prognosis and preference for comfort-based care, he was started on LMWH for symptom control rather than aggressive intervention, alongside palliative support.

pulmonary_embolism_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Bilateral Subsegmental Pulmonary Embolism
  presenting_complaint: Vague chest discomfort
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old healthy male athlete complained of mild discomfort when taking deep breaths. D-dimer was borderline at 550 ng/mL, but CTPA was performed due to clinical suspicion, showing tiny bilateral subsegmental clots. After discussion regarding the clinical significance of isolated subsegmental PE, he opted for a short three-month course of anticoagulation.

pulmonary_embolism_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Pulmonary Embolism with Right Heart Thrombus
  presenting_complaint: Severe dyspnoea and "fluttering" in chest
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old female presented with acute respiratory failure. Bedside echocardiography showed a "clot-in-transit" mobile thrombus within the right atrium. She was immediately started on heparin and underwent emergency surgical embolectomy to remove both the atrial thrombus and the associated large pulmonary emboli.

pulmonary_embolism_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Pulmonary Embolism masked by COPD
  presenting_complaint: Exacerbation of breathlessness and wheeze
  summary_of_course: A 73-year-old smoker with severe COPD was admitted with what appeared to be an infective exacerbation. When he failed to respond to bronchodilators, steroids, and antibiotics over 48 hours, a CTPA was requested. It revealed a significant right-sided lobar PE, explaining his refractory hypoxia; he was successfully treated with anticoagulation.
