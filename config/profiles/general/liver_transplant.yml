  primary_diagnosis: Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath and abdominal distension.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with ZZ phenotype Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency had both pulmonary emphysema and liver cirrhosis. His lung function was deemed sufficient for surgery (FEV1 65% predicted). He underwent elective liver transplantation, which successfully restored normal alpha-1 antitrypsin levels and stabilized his liver disease, though he remains under respiratory follow-up.

liver_transplant_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH)
  presenting_complaint: Refractory jaundice despite high-dose immunosuppression.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female with AIH failed to achieve remission with prednisolone and azathioprine. She progressed to end-stage liver disease with recurrent variceal haemorrhage. She received a liver transplant from a DBD (donation after brain death) donor; her post-operative course was uncomplicated, and she is maintained on tacrolimus monotherapy.

liver_transplant_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Budd-Chiari Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of painful hepatomegaly and ascites.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female with an underlying JAK2 mutation developed acute thrombosis of the hepatic veins. Despite anticoagulation and an attempted TIPS procedure, she developed liver necrosis.
