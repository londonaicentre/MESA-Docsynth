ankylosing_spondylitis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Ankylosing spondylitis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic lower back pain and morning stiffness
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male presented with a 6-month history of dull lower back pain that is worse at night and improves with exercise. Blood tests revealed HLA-B27 positivity and a mildly raised CRP of 12 mg/L. Pelvic X-rays showed bilateral Grade 2 sacroiliitis, confirming early-stage ankylosing spondylitis. He was commenced on Naproxen 500mg twice daily and referred for specialist physiotherapy, showing significant improvement in his BASDAI score at 3 months.

ankylosing_spondylitis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Advanced ankylosing spondylitis with restrictive lung disease
  presenting_complaint: Severe spinal deformity and shortness of breath
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with a 40-year history of untreated axial symptoms presented with progressive kyphosis and exertional dyspnoea. Imaging demonstrated a "bamboo spine" with extensive syndesmophyte formation and fusion of the sacroiliac joints. Pulmonary function tests revealed a restrictive pattern (FVC 58% predicted) attributed to thoracic cage fixation. Management focused on pain relief, breathing exercises, and monitoring for cardiovascular complications.

ankylosing_spondylitis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent buttock pain and nocturnal awakening
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old female presented with alternating buttock pain and stiffness for 2 years, previously misdiagnosed as mechanical back pain. While pelvic X-rays were normal, a STIR-sequence MRI of the sacroiliac joints revealed significant bone marrow oedema. She responded poorly to two different NSAIDs and was subsequently started on Etanercept, resulting in a dramatic reduction in symptoms and inflammatory markers.

ankylosing_spondylitis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Juvenile-onset ankylosing spondylitis
  presenting_complaint: Right knee swelling and heel pain
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old boy presented with asymmetrical oligoarthritis and Achilles enthesitis. Over the following three years, he developed progressive inflammatory back pain and HLA-B27 was found to be positive. Radiographic sacroiliitis became evident at age 17, confirming the progression to ankylosing spondylitis. He is currently managed with Sulfasalazine and regular hydrotherapy to maintain joint mobility.

ankylosing_spondylitis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Ankylosing spondylitis with acute anterior uveitis
  presenting_complaint: Painful red eye and photophobia
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male with known ankylosing spondylitis presented to the eye casualty with a sudden onset unilateral red eye. Slit-lamp examination confirmed acute anterior uveitis, a common extra-articular manifestation. He was treated with topical prednisolone and cyclopentolate drops, while his systemic treatment was escalated from NSAIDs to Adalimumab to better control both his spinal disease and recurrent ocular flares.

ankylosing_spondylitis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Ankylosing spondylitis with Andersson lesion
  presenting_complaint: Sudden localised mid-back pain following minor trauma
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with long-standing fused spine (ankylosing spondylitis) presented after a minor fall with focal spinal pain. CT imaging revealed an Andersson lesion (discovertebral fracture) at the T11-T12 level. Due to the inherent instability of a fused spine, he was admitted for spinal bracing and strict bed rest to prevent neurological compromise, eventually requiring surgical stabilisation.

ankylosing_spondylitis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Ankylosing spondylitis with secondary AA amyloidosis
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral leg oedema and frothy urine
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with a 25-year history of poorly controlled ankylosing spondylitis presented with nephrotic-range proteinuria (6g/24h). A renal biopsy confirmed AA amyloidosis, a rare complication of chronic systemic inflammation. Management involved aggressive suppression of the underlying inflammation with IL-17 inhibitors (Secukinumab) and ACE inhibition to manage proteinuria.

ankylosing_spondylitis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Ankylosing spondylitis with Cauda Equina Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Urinary incontinence and saddle anaesthesia
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with chronic, severe ankylosing spondylitis presented with subacute onset of bladder dysfunction and sensory loss. MRI demonstrated dural ectasia and multiple arachnoid diverticula compressing the cauda equina nerve roots, a rare late-stage complication. He underwent urgent neurosurgical decompression, though he was left with residual neurogenic bladder dysfunction.

ankylosing_spondylitis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Enteropathic spondyloarthritis (AS associated with Crohn's)
  presenting_complaint: Bloody diarrhoea and inflammatory back pain
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease developed worsening sacroiliac pain and morning stiffness. Investigations confirmed active sacroiliitis on MRI and active colonic inflammation on colonoscopy. She was started on Infliximab, which successfully managed both her gastrointestinal symptoms and her axial skeletal inflammation.

ankylosing_spondylitis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Ankylosing spondylitis with aortic regurgitation
  presenting_complaint: Exertional breathlessness and palpitations
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with a long history of ankylosing spondylitis was noted to have a new diastolic murmur during a routine check-up. Echocardiography revealed aortic root dilatation and moderate aortic regurgitation, attributed to chronic aortitis associated with his spondyloarthritis. He was referred to cardiology for monitoring and potential valve replacement, while his rheumatological treatment was optimised.

ankylosing_spondylitis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Ankylosing spondylitis with apical pulmonary fibrosis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent dry cough and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male smoker with advanced ankylosing spondylitis presented with respiratory symptoms. Chest X-ray and HRCT showed bilateral apical fibrobullous disease, a recognised but rare pulmonary complication of AS. Sputum cultures were negative for tuberculosis and aspergillus, and he was managed supportively with smoking cessation and pulmonary rehabilitation.

ankylosing_spondylitis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Ankylosing spondylitis, treatment-refractory
  presenting_complaint: Persistent high disease activity despite biologics
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male with HLA-B27 positive AS failed to respond to two different TNF-alpha inhibitors (Adalimumab and Etanercept) with a BASDAI remaining above 6. He was switched to a JAK inhibitor (Upadacitinib) as per NICE guidelines. Within 12 weeks, his CRP normalised and he reported a 50% reduction in spinal pain and stiffness.

ankylosing_spondylitis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Ankylosing spondylitis with atlanto-axial subluxation
  presenting_complaint: Neck pain and electric shock sensations in limbs
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female with long-standing AS presented with Lhermitte's sign and severe cervical stiffness. Lateral cervical spine X-rays in flexion and extension revealed an increased atlantodental interval of 5mm, indicating atlanto-axial instability. She was fitted with a hard cervical collar and underwent elective posterior C1-C2 fusion to prevent spinal cord injury.

ankylosing_spondylitis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Ankylosing spondylitis in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Severe back pain flare during second trimester
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant female with known AS experienced a significant flare of inflammatory back pain at 24 weeks gestation. After a multidisciplinary review, she was started on Certolizumab pegol, a TNF inhibitor with minimal placental transfer. Her symptoms stabilised, allowing for a successful vaginal delivery at term without further rheumatological complications.

ankylosing_spondylitis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Ankylosing spondylitis with secondary hip osteoarthritis
  presenting_complaint: Severe groin pain and inability to walk
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male with AS since his teens presented with progressive bilateral hip pain. Radiographs showed complete loss of joint space and femoral head flattening consistent with secondary osteoarthritis. He underwent bilateral total hip replacements (THR) in a staged approach, which significantly improved his mobility and quality of life despite his fused spine.

ankylosing_spondylitis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Late-onset ankylosing spondylitis
  presenting_complaint: New onset spinal stiffness at age 65
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male presented with a 1-year history of inflammatory-type back pain. While initially suspected of having DISH (Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis), his HLA-B27 was positive and MRI showed active sacroiliitis rather than the bulky flowing ossification characteristic of DISH. He responded well to low-dose NSAIDs and remains under outpatient rheumatology surveillance.

ankylosing_spondylitis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Ankylosing spondylitis with IgA nephropathy
  presenting_complaint: Macroscopic haematuria following URTI
  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old male with established AS presented with "cola-coloured" urine following a sore throat. Urinalysis showed haematuria and proteinuria, and a renal biopsy confirmed IgA nephropathy, which has a known association with AS. His renal function remained stable with BP control, and his AS was managed with Celecoxib, avoiding nephrotoxic doses.

ankylosing_spondylitis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Ankylosing spondylitis with severe kyphosis
  presenting_complaint: Inability to look straight ahead ("chin-on-chest" deformity)
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male presented with a fixed flexion deformity of the cervical and thoracic spine, severely limiting his field of vision and causing social isolation. Following extensive preoperative planning and 3D imaging, he underwent a multi-level spinal osteotomy. Post-operatively, his horizontal gaze was restored, though he required prolonged inpatient rehabilitation.

ankylosing_spondylitis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Ankylosing spondylitis, HLA-B27 negative
  presenting_complaint: Chronic inflammatory back pain and dactylitis
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old male presented with typical inflammatory back pain and "sausage digit" (dactylitis) of the second toe. Despite being HLA-B27 negative, his MRI showed definitive bilateral sacroiliitis and enthesitis at the pelvic brim. He was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis (axial spondyloarthritis) and started on a regimen of Naproxen and methotrexate for peripheral involvement.

ankylosing_spondylitis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Ankylosing spondylitis with osteoporosis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden back pain after sneezing
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with long-standing, poorly controlled AS presented with acute mid-thoracic pain. A DEXA scan revealed a T-score of -2.8 at the femoral neck, and X-rays confirmed a vertebral compression fracture at T8. He was treated with bisphosphonates, Vitamin D supplementation, and a temporary brace, highlighting the increased risk of osteoporosis in chronic inflammatory spinal disease.
