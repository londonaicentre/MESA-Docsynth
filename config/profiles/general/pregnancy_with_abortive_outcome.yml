pregnancy_with_abortive_outcome_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Cervical ectopic pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Profuse, painless vaginal bleeding at 6 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old female presented with sudden heavy bleeding; examination showed a bluish, distended cervix. TVUS confirmed an hourglass-shaped uterus with the gestational sac implanted in the cervical canal below the internal os. Due to the high risk of haemorrhage, she was treated with systemic methotrexate and uterine artery embolisation.

pregnancy_with_abortive_outcome_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Heterotopic pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Left-sided abdominal pain despite a confirmed intrauterine pregnancy.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female who underwent IVF presented at 7 weeks with unilateral pain. Ultrasound showed a viable intrauterine pregnancy and a concurrent left tubal pregnancy with a visible heartbeat. She underwent a laparoscopic salpingectomy to remove the ectopic pregnancy, while the intrauterine pregnancy remained viable.

pregnancy_with_abortive_outcome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent miscarriage secondary to Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS)
  presenting_complaint: Fourth consecutive early pregnancy loss at 8 weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 37-year-old female presented with vaginal bleeding and loss of pregnancy symptoms. Previous investigations confirmed APS (positive lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies). Despite being on low-dose aspirin, she suffered another spontaneous abortion and was counselled regarding adding low-molecular-weight heparin for future pregnancies.
