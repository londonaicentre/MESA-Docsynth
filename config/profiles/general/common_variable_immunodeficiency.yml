  primary_diagnosis: Common Variable Immunodeficiency
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent sinopulmonary infections and productive cough
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female presented with her fourth episode of bacterial pneumonia in two years. Investigations revealed IgG 2.1 g/L, IgA <0.05 g/L, and poor polysaccharide vaccine responses. She was started on lifelong intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) replacement therapy and remains stable with significantly reduced infection frequency.

common_variable_immunodeficiency_002:
  primary_diagnosis: CVID with Granulomatous-Lymphocytic Interstitial Lung Disease (GLILD)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive exertional dyspnoea and dry cough
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male with known CVID on subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIg) reported worsening breathlessness. HRCT showed diffuse ground-glass opacities and nodules; lung biopsy confirmed GLILD. Treatment was escalated to include mycophenolate mofetil and rituximab, resulting in improvement of lung function tests.

common_variable_immunodeficiency_003:
  primary_diagnosis: CVID-associated Enteropathy
  presenting_complaint: Chronic diarrhoea, bloating, and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old woman presented with six months of malabsorptive diarrhoea and 10kg weight loss. Jejunal biopsy showed villous atrophy and absent plasma cells, while stool PCR was positive for Giardia lamblia. Following metronidazole and optimisation of IVIg, her gastrointestinal symptoms resolved, though she requires ongoing nutritional support.

common_variable_immunodeficiency_004:
  primary_diagnosis: CVID with Autoimmune Haemolytic Anaemia (AIHA)
  presenting_complaint: Severe fatigue, jaundice, and dark urine
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male presented acutely with symptomatic anaemia (Hb 62 g/L) and a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT). Further screening for recurrent childhood infections led to a diagnosis of CVID with secondary AIHA (Evans syndrome). He responded well to high-dose corticosteroids and subsequent immunoglobulin replacement.

common_variable_immunodeficiency_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Common Variable Immunodeficiency
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent otitis media and failure to thrive
  summary_of_course: an 8-year-old boy was referred to immunology due to persistent ear infections and poor growth velocity. Laboratory tests confirmed pan-hypogammaglobinaemia and a lack of B-cell maturation (reduced switched memory B-cells). He was transitioned to weekly SCIg at home, which led to a catch-up in growth and cessation of ear discharge.

common_variable_immunodeficiency_006:
  primary_diagnosis: CVID with Bronchiectasis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic daily sputum production and haemoptysis
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female with a late diagnosis of CVID presented with established cystic bronchiectasis on CT. Despite IVIg therapy, she suffers from chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonisation. Management involves three-times-weekly azithromycin prophylaxis and regular chest physiotherapy alongside immunoglobulin replacement.

common_variable_immunodeficiency_007:
  primary_diagnosis: CVID-related Nodular Regenerative Hyperplasia (NRH)
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal distension and splenomegaly
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with CVID presented with signs of portal hypertension and significant splenomegaly. Liver biopsy confirmed NRH without cirrhosis, a known complication of CVID. He is currently managed with prophylactic propranolol and regular endoscopic surveillance for oesophageal varices.

common_variable_immunodeficiency_008:
  primary_diagnosis: CVID with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
  presenting_complaint: Persistent cervical lymphadenopathy and night sweats
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old woman with a 15-year history of CVID developed rapidly enlarging lymph nodes. Excisional biopsy confirmed Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). She underwent R-CHOP chemotherapy with careful monitoring of immunoglobulin levels and aggressive antibiotic prophylaxis during neutropenic periods.

common_variable_immunodeficiency_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Common Variable Immunodeficiency
  presenting_complaint: Acute bacterial meningitis
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male was admitted to the ICU with meningism and sepsis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Post-recovery immunology screening revealed profound hypogammaglobinaemia (IgG 1.5 g/L). He was diagnosed with CVID and commenced on IVIg, with no further invasive bacterial infections reported at two-year follow-up.

common_variable_immunodeficiency_010:
  primary_diagnosis: CVID with Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)
  presenting_complaint: Spontaneous bruising and epistaxis
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female presented with a platelet count of 4 x 10^9/L. Initial treatment for ITP was started, but a history of recurrent sinusitis prompted immunoglobulin testing, confirming CVID. Her ITP proved refractory to steroids but eventually stabilised following rituximab therapy and IVIg.

common_variable_immunodeficiency_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Common Variable Immunodeficiency
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent skin abscesses and furunculosis
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old male presented to dermatology with recurrent Staphylococcus aureus skin infections. Routine screening showed low serum IgG and IgM, and a subsequent immunology review confirmed CVID. Since commencing SCIg, his skin infections have resolved completely, and his inflammatory markers have normalised.

common_variable_immunodeficiency_012:
  primary_diagnosis: CVID with Gastric Adenocarcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Epigastric pain and iron deficiency anaemia
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with known CVID for 20 years presented with new-onset dyspepsia. Gastroscopy revealed an ulcerated lesion in the antrum, confirmed as adenocarcinoma on biopsy. This highlight the increased risk of gastric malignancy in CVID patients, necessitating a low threshold for endoscopic investigation.

common_variable_immunodeficiency_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Common Variable Immunodeficiency
  presenting_complaint: Septic arthritis of the hip
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old woman presented with acute hip pain and inability to weight-bear; joint aspirate grew Mycoplasma hominis. This unusual pathogen prompted an immunological workup, revealing CVID. She required surgical washout, prolonged targeted antibiotics, and the initiation of IVIg replacement.

common_variable_immunodeficiency_014:
  primary_diagnosis: CVID with Systemic Granulomatous Disease
  presenting_complaint: Skin papules and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male presented with sarcoid-like skin lesions and hilar adenopathy on chest X-ray. Biopsy showed non-caseating granulomas, but further testing revealed low Igs and poor vaccine response, confirming CVID rather than sarcoidosis. He was treated with low-dose prednisolone and IVIg.

common_variable_immunodeficiency_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Common Variable Immunodeficiency
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent viral and bacterial conjunctivitis
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female presented with chronic ocular surface infections and blepharitis. After failing multiple topical treatments, systemic screening identified IgG 3.2 g/L and IgA <0.1 g/L. Diagnosis of CVID was made, and symptoms improved significantly once systemic immunoglobulin levels were corrected.

common_variable_immunodeficiency_016:
  primary_diagnosis: CVID in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Routine obstetric review for known CVID
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old pregnant woman with CVID required increased doses of IVIg to maintain trough IgG levels above 8 g/L during the third trimester. The pregnancy proceeded without major infectious complications, and she delivered a healthy neonate who was monitored for transient neonatal hypogammaglobinaemia.

common_variable_immunodeficiency_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Common Variable Immunodeficiency
  presenting_complaint: Chronic sinusitis and loss of smell
  summary_of_course: A 47-year-old male had undergone three functional endoscopic sinus surgeries (FESS) with minimal relief. Post-operative immunology referral identified CVID as the underlying cause of his refractory rhinosinusitis. Maintenance on SCIg and nasal steroid irrigations finally provided symptomatic control.

common_variable_immunodeficiency_018:
  primary_diagnosis: CVID with Treatment-Induced Anaphylaxis
  presenting_complaint: Severe flushing, wheezing, and hypotension during IVIg infusion
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female with CVID experienced a life-threatening anaphylactoid reaction during her second IVIg dose. Investigation showed she had undetectable IgA and anti-IgA antibodies. She was successfully transitioned to a rapid-push SCIg protocol using an IgA-depleted product, which she now tolerates well.

common_variable_immunodeficiency_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Common Variable Immunodeficiency
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of low globulins on liver function tests
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old asymptomatic male was found to have a low total protein and globulin gap during a routine health check. Specialist testing confirmed IgG 4.0 g/L and impaired response to pneumococcal vaccination. Despite being "mildly" affected, he was started on IVIg due to a history of two hospitalisations for "flu" that was likely occult pneumonia.

common_variable_immunodeficiency_020:
  primary_diagnosis: CVID with Chronic Respiratory Failure
  presenting_complaint: Acute-on-chronic breathlessness and Type 2 respiratory failure
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with long-standing, poorly managed CVID and end-stage bronchiectasis was admitted with a severe exacerbation. He required non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and IV antibiotics in the high dependency unit. He was eventually discharged on home oxygen and palliative input, highlighting the morbidity of late-stage CVID lung disease.
