  primary_diagnosis: Acute Viral Myocarditis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset chest pain and profound lethargy following a flu-like illness.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old female presented in acute respiratory distress two weeks after a viral prodrome. Imaging showed a rapidly enlarging heart silhouette (globose heart) on CXR and global hypokinesis on ultrasound. She was admitted to the paediatric ICU for inotropic support and intravenous immunoglobulins, showing gradual recovery of cardiac size over six months.

  primary_diagnosis: Hypertensive Heart Disease
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of an enlarged heart on routine screening.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old asymptomatic male underwent a pre-employment CXR which demonstrated mild cardiomegaly. Investigation revealed long-standing untreated hypertension (180/110 mmHg) and left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG. He was commenced on amlodipine and ramipril, with lifestyle modifications initiated to prevent progression to overt heart failure.

  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic Cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal bloating and shortness of breath.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with a 20-year history of heavy alcohol consumption presented with clinical signs of right-sided heart failure. CXR showed moderate cardiomegaly, and echocardiography revealed four-chamber dilatation. Following total abstinence and intensive medical therapy, his cardiac dimensions showed modest improvement over one year.

cardiomegaly_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Mitral Regurgitation
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations and reduced exercise tolerance.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with a known mitral valve prolapse presented with new-onset atrial fibrillation. Investigations showed severe mitral regurgitation and significant left atrial and ventricular enlargement, contributing to moderate cardiomegaly on imaging. She successfully underwent mitral valve replacement, which stabilised her cardiac dimensions.

  presenting_complaint: Worsening peripheral oedema and chronic productive cough.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old smoker with severe COPD presented with signs of right heart failure. CXR demonstrated a prominent right heart border and enlarged pulmonary arteries, consistent with right-sided cardiomegaly. Management focused on long-term oxygen therapy and optimising bronchodilators to reduce pulmonary hypertension.

cardiomegaly_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Cardiac Amyloidosis
  presenting_complaint: Syncope and restrictive heart failure symptoms.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male presented with repeated falls and breathlessness. While CXR showed only moderate cardiomegaly, echocardiography revealed markedly thickened ventricular walls with a "speckled" appearance. Cardiac MRI and biopsy confirmed AL amyloidosis, necessitating a palliative approach due to the advanced stage of the disease.

cardiomegaly_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Large Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)
  presenting_complaint: Failure to thrive and tachypnoea in an infant.
  summary_of_course: A 4-month-old infant presented with poor feeding and intercostal recession. Imaging revealed severe cardiomegaly and pulmonary plethora due to a large left-to-right shunt. The patient underwent urgent surgical closure of the VSD, resulting in a significant reduction in cardiac size and normalisation of growth.

  primary_diagnosis: Thyrotoxicosis-induced Cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Tachycardia, weight loss, and exertional dyspnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old female with untreated Graves' disease presented with high-output cardiac failure. Investigations showed moderate cardiomegaly and rapid atrial fibrillation. Treatment with carbimazole and beta-blockers restored a euthyroid state, leading to the complete resolution of cardiomegaly within four months.

cardiomegaly_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Haemochromatosis
  presenting_complaint: Skin hyperpigmentation and symptoms of heart failure.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with hereditary haemochromatosis presented with subacute dyspnoea. MRI T2* imaging confirmed significant cardiac iron overload, and CXR showed moderate cardiomegaly. He was managed with intensive venesection and iron chelation therapy to improve myocardial function.

cardiomegaly_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Chagas Heart Disease
  presenting_complaint: Dizziness and palpitations in a migrant from South America.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male presented with high-grade AV block and chronic heart failure. Imaging revealed an apical aneurysm and severe global cardiomegaly. Serology confirmed Trypanosoma cruzi infection, and the patient required a permanent pacemaker and standard heart failure therapy.

  presenting_complaint: Muffled heart sounds and pleuritic chest pain.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer presented with acute breathlessness and hypotension. CXR showed a massive "water-bottle" heart silhouette, initially appearing as severe cardiomegaly. Urgent pericardiocentesis drained 800ml of serosanguinous fluid, immediately reducing the cardiac silhouette size and relieving tamponade.

  primary_diagnosis: Cocaine-induced Dilated Cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Acute chest pain and palpitations.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male with frequent cocaine use presented to the emergency department. CXR showed moderate cardiomegaly, and echocardiography revealed a dilated, hypocontractile left ventricle. Despite cessation of drug use and initiation of heart failure medication, he remained with a persistently enlarged heart and reduced exercise capacity.

  primary_diagnosis: Anthracycline-induced Cardiotoxicity
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue and breathlessness years after chemotherapy.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female, a survivor of childhood leukaemia, presented with chronic heart failure. Investigations revealed moderate cardiomegaly and an ejection fraction of 35%, attributed to prior doxorubicin exposure. She was managed with long-term heart failure therapy and regular echocardiographic surveillance.

cardiomegaly_016:

  presenting_complaint: Enlarging hands and feet with new-onset dyspnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 47-year-old male was diagnosed with a growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma. Cardiac evaluation showed biventricular hypertrophy and mild cardiomegaly on CXR. Following transsphenoidal surgery and somatostatin analogues, his growth hormone levels normalised, preventing further cardiac deterioration.

  primary_diagnosis: End-stage Renal Disease with Fluid Overload
  presenting_complaint: Acute respiratory distress and missed dialysis sessions.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with ESRD presented with life-threatening pulmonary oedema. CXR showed severe cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusions. Emergency haemodialysis with ultrafiltration was performed, resulting in a rapid reduction in cardiac silhouette size and clinical stabilisation.

cardiomegaly_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Physiological Athlete's Heart
  presenting_complaint: Borderline cardiomegaly on a routine sports screening CXR.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old elite rower underwent cardiac screening which showed a CTR of 0.52. Despite the mild cardiomegaly, ECG showed sinus bradycardia and echocardiography confirmed symmetrical ventricular hypertrophy with normal diastolic function and a high-normal ejection fraction. This was determined to be a physiological adaptation to intensive training rather than pathology.

cardiomegaly_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Aortic Regurgitation
  presenting_complaint: Forceful heartbeat and exertional angina.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with a bicuspid aortic valve presented with signs of volume overload. CXR demonstrated severe left ventricular enlargement and a prominent ascending aorta. Echocardiography confirmed severe regurgitation with a dilated LV (LVEDD 75mm), necessitating urgent aortic valve replacement to prevent irreversible damage.
