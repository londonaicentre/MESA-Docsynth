hydronephrosis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Congenital pelviureteric junction obstruction
  presenting_complaint: Antenatal ultrasound finding of dilated renal pelvis
  summary_of_course: A male neonate was diagnosed with unilateral left-sided hydronephrosis on a 20-week anomaly scan. Postnatal ultrasound confirmed persistent Grade 3 hydronephrosis with a dilated renal pelvis but normal ureter. MAG3 renography at six weeks showed delayed drainage, leading to a successful robotic-assisted pyeloplasty at six months.

hydronephrosis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute obstructive uropathy due to urolithiasis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset severe right loin pain and macroscopic haematuria
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male presented to A&E with excruciating right-sided renal colic and nausea. CT KUB revealed a 7mm calculus lodged at the vesicoureteric junction (VUJ) causing moderate acute hydroureteronephrosis. He underwent urgent primary ureteroscopy and stone fragmentation after failing to progress with conservative management and alpha-blockers.

hydronephrosis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Physiological hydronephrosis of pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Mild right-sided flank discomfort at 28 weeks gestation
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old primigravida presented with persistent right flank aching and no features of infection. Obstetric ultrasound demonstrated mild-to-moderate right-sided hydronephrosis, consistent with dextrorotation of the uterus and progesterone-mediated smooth muscle relaxation. Symptoms remained stable with conservative management and resolved spontaneously six weeks postpartum.

hydronephrosis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Posterior urethral valves (PUV)
  presenting_complaint: Poor urinary stream and palpable bladder in a male infant
  summary_of_course: A 2-week-old male infant presented with irritability and a weak, dribbling urinary stream. Ultrasound showed bilateral severe hydroureteronephrosis and a thickened "keyhole" bladder neck. He was stabilised with a supra-pubic catheter before undergoing endoscopic valve ablation, though he remains under long-term nephrology follow-up for stage 2 chronic kidney disease.

hydronephrosis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic bilateral hydronephrosis secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia
  presenting_complaint: Nocturia, hesitancy, and progressive bilateral leg oedema
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male with long-standing lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) presented with acute-on-chronic renal failure (Creatinine 450 µmol/L). Imaging confirmed high-pressure chronic retention with bilateral moderate hydronephrosis and a bladder volume of 1.2L. Urgent urethral catheterisation resulted in post-obstructive diuresis, followed by a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) after renal function stabilised.

hydronephrosis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Pyonephrosis
  presenting_complaint: Rigors, high fever, and left-sided loin pain
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female with type 2 diabetes presented in septic shock with a temperature of 39.4°C. CT revealed severe left hydronephrosis due to an obstructing proximal ureteric stone with perinephric stranding and fluid levels suggesting pus. She underwent emergency percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) drainage and IV antibiotics, with subsequent ureterolithotomy once the infection was controlled.

hydronephrosis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Retroperitoneal fibrosis (Ormond's disease)
  presenting_complaint: Vague mid-back pain and unexplained weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male smoker presented with dull lumbar pain and a rising serum creatinine over three months. MRI demonstrated a soft tissue mass encasing the infrarenal aorta and both ureters, causing bilateral medial deviation and moderate hydronephrosis. He responded well to a combination of ureteric stenting and high-dose corticosteroid therapy, with gradual regression of the fibrotic plaque.

hydronephrosis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic ureteric injury post-hysterectomy
  presenting_complaint: Reduced urine output and ileus 48 hours post-surgery
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female underwent a difficult total abdominal hysterectomy for endometriosis. Postoperatively, she developed rising inflammatory markers and right-sided fullness; ultrasound showed new-onset severe right hydronephrosis. Antegrade pyelography confirmed a complete ureteric ligation, necessitating immediate nephrostomy and delayed ureteroneocystostomy.

hydronephrosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Malignant ureteric obstruction secondary to cervical carcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral flank heaviness and uraemic pruritus
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female with FIGO Stage IIIB cervical cancer presented with progressive oliguria. Imaging showed extensive pelvic lymphadenopathy causing extrinsic compression of both distal ureters with severe bilateral hydronephrosis. Given her palliative status, bilateral retrograde JJ stents were attempted but failed, leading to the placement of bilateral permanent percutaneous nephrostomies for symptom control.

hydronephrosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Dietl's crisis (Intermittent hydronephrosis)
  presenting_complaint: Episodic, severe left-sided abdominal pain following high fluid intake
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old student reported paroxysms of intense left flank pain associated with nausea, often after drinking large amounts of water or beer. Ultrasound during an asymptomatic period was normal, but a repeat scan during an acute episode revealed significant left hydronephrosis. A MAG3 scan with frusemide washout confirmed a dynamic pelviureteric junction obstruction, which was treated with laparoscopic pyeloplasty.

hydronephrosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Neurogenic bladder secondary to Multiple Sclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent urinary tract infections and overflow incontinence
  summary_of_course: A 49-year-old female with advanced MS presented with worsening renal function and recurrent cystitis. Urodynamic studies showed detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia, and renal ultrasound revealed bilateral moderate hydronephrosis due to high intravesical pressures. Management involved the initiation of clean intermittent self-catheterisation (CISC) and anticholinergic medication, which successfully decompressed the upper tracts.

hydronephrosis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Ureteric stricture secondary to Schistosomiasis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic pelvic pain and intermittent haematuria
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male who recently emigrated from sub-Saharan Africa presented with long-standing dysuria. Imaging showed "calcified bladder" (egg-shell calcification) and multiple distal ureteric strictures causing bilateral mild hydronephrosis. Urine microscopy confirmed Schistosoma haematobium eggs; he was treated with Praziquantel and required subsequent ureteric dilatation for the fibrotic strictures.

hydronephrosis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute obstructive uropathy in a solitary kidney
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset anuria and vomiting
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male with a history of a previous right nephrectomy for RCC presented with no urine output for 12 hours. Ultrasound of the remaining left kidney showed severe hydronephrosis and a 5mm stone at the PUJ. This was treated as a surgical emergency; he underwent immediate retrograde JJ stent insertion, which resulted in a rapid return of renal function.

hydronephrosis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Ureteric endometriosis
  presenting_complaint: Cyclical right-sided flank pain coinciding with menstruation
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old female with known pelvic endometriosis presented with worsening cyclical renal colic. MRI pelvis demonstrated an endometriotic nodule involving the right distal ureter causing proximal hydronephrosis. She underwent laparoscopic excision of the nodule and ureterolysis, which resolved the obstruction and preserved renal function.

hydronephrosis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder
  presenting_complaint: Painless macroscopic haematuria
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male smoker presented with several episodes of frank, painless haematuria. Flexible cystoscopy revealed a large papillary tumour overlying the right ureteric orifice. CT Urogram confirmed severe right-sided hydronephrosis due to the tumour's mass effect, necessitating a transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) and subsequent staging for muscle-invasive disease.

hydronephrosis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Pelvic organ prolapse (Stage IV Procidentia)
  presenting_complaint: Vaginal bulge and difficulty voiding
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female presented with a complete uterine procidentia. Routine bloods showed an incidental rise in creatinine (180 µmol/L), and ultrasound confirmed bilateral moderate hydronephrosis due to the ureters being dragged down into the hernial sac. The hydronephrosis resolved completely following a vaginal hysterectomy and pelvic floor repair.

hydronephrosis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Crossing vessel pelviureteric junction obstruction
  presenting_complaint: Persistent dull ache in the left loin exacerbated by exercise
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male athlete was investigated for chronic left-sided discomfort. CT Angiography identified an accessory lower pole renal artery crossing and compressing the pelviureteric junction, causing Grade 2 hydronephrosis. He underwent a laparoscopic Anderson-Hynes pyeloplasty with transposition of the crossing vessel, resulting in complete symptom resolution.

hydronephrosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic hydronephrosis secondary to radiation cystitis
  presenting_complaint: Frequency, urgency, and bilateral flank pain
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male, five years post-radiotherapy for prostate cancer, developed a contracted, low-compliance bladder. Imaging showed bilateral hydroureteronephrosis due to distal ureteric scarring and high storage pressures. Despite maximal medical therapy, his renal function declined, eventually requiring urinary diversion via an ileal conduit.

hydronephrosis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Ureteric stricture in a renal transplant
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic rise in serum creatinine during routine follow-up
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male, two years post-deceased donor renal transplant, showed a creatinine rise from 110 to 195 µmol/L. Ultrasound of the transplant kidney in the right iliac fossa revealed new-onset moderate hydronephrosis. Antegrade pyelography confirmed a stricture at the ureteroneocystostomy site, which was successfully treated with balloon dilatation and temporary stenting.

hydronephrosis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) Grade V
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent febrile UTIs and failure to thrive
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old female presented with her third episode of pyelonephritis in twelve months. Micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG) demonstrated bilateral Grade V reflux with severe dilatation of the ureters and renal pelvis (hydronephrosis) during voiding. She was initially managed with prophylactic antibiotics but eventually required bilateral ureteric reimplantation due to breakthrough infections and progressive renal scarring.
