  primary_diagnosis: Acute Exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD)
  presenting_complaint: Increased sputum purulence and worsening dyspnoea
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female with known moderate COPD presented to A&E with a three-day history of green sputum and increased inhaler use. Clinical examination showed bilateral wheeze and saturations of 89% on room air. She was treated with a five-day course of prednisolone and amoxicillin, alongside nebulised salbutamol, resulting in symptomatic improvement.

copd_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe COPD with Type 2 Respiratory Failure
  presenting_complaint: Drowsiness and acute shortness of breath
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with end-stage emphysema was admitted via ambulance with acute-on-chronic respiratory failure. Arterial blood gas showed pH 7.28, pCO2 8.4 kPa, and pO2 7.1 kPa.

  primary_diagnosis: Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Progressive breathlessness in a young non-smoker
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male presented with significant dyspnoea on climbing stairs. Imaging showed panacinar emphysema predominantly in the lower lobes, and blood tests confirmed a PiZZ phenotype with low serum alpha-1 antitrypsin levels. He was commenced on intensive medical management and referred to a specialist centre for consideration of augmentation therapy.

copd_005:
  primary_diagnosis: COPD with Cor Pulmonale
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral leg swelling and exertional fatigue
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female with a 40 pack-year smoking history presented with worsening peripheral oedema and raised JVP. Echocardiography demonstrated right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary hypertension secondary to chronic lung disease.

  primary_diagnosis: Bullous Emphysema with Spontaneous Pneumothorax
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset pleuritic chest pain and breathlessness
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male with severe COPD presented acutely with unilateral chest pain. A chest X-ray revealed a 30% pneumothorax secondary to a ruptured apical bulla. An intercostal chest drain was inserted, and he later underwent pleurodesis due to a persistent air leak.

copd_007:
  primary_diagnosis: COPD-Bronchiectasis Overlap Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Chronic productive cough with large volumes of foul-smelling sputum
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old female with long-standing COPD and recurrent chest infections underwent a high-resolution CT scan which confirmed co-existing bronchiectasis. Sputum cultures grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa. She was started on a management plan including airway clearance techniques and prophylactic low-dose azithromycin.

  presenting_complaint: Severe weight loss and inability to perform activities of daily living
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with GOLD Grade 4 COPD presented with a BMI of 17.5 and significant muscle wasting. Despite optimal inhaler therapy, his FEV1 remained at 24% predicted. He was referred to a pulmonary rehabilitation programme and a dietician for nutritional support to manage systemic manifestations of his disease.

copd_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Exacerbation of COPD with Secondary Polycythaemia
  presenting_complaint: Headache, plethora, and worsening hypoxia
  summary_of_course: A 73-year-old male with chronic hypoxaemia presented with an exacerbation. Blood tests showed a haemoglobin of 195 g/L and haematocrit of 0.58, consistent with secondary polycythaemia. He was treated for the infection and subsequently assessed for ambulatory oxygen to reduce his thrombotic risk.

copd_010:
  primary_diagnosis: COPD and Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (Overlap Syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Daytime somnolence and morning headaches
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old obese male with moderate COPD reported poor sleep quality and loud snoring. A sleep study confirmed OSA with an AHI of 25. He was successfully treated with nocturnal CPAP therapy, which improved both his daytime fatigue and his overall respiratory stability.

copd_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Biomass-induced COPD
  presenting_complaint: Chronic dyspnoea in a lifelong non-smoker
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old female originally from a rural background presented with obstructive physiology on spirometry. History revealed decades of exposure to indoor biomass fuel smoke for cooking. She was diagnosed with COPD and started on dual bronchodilator therapy (LABA/LAMA) with significant symptomatic relief.

copd_012:
  primary_diagnosis: COPD with Frequent Exacerbator Phenotype
  presenting_complaint: Four hospital admissions in the last twelve months
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male continued to experience recurrent infective exacerbations despite triple therapy (ICS/LABA/LAMA). Investigation into his inhaler technique showed significant errors, which were corrected using a spacer device. His rescue medication use decreased following intensive education and the introduction of a self-management plan.

copd_013:
  primary_diagnosis: End-stage COPD requiring Palliative Care
  presenting_complaint: Refractory breathlessness at rest
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with very severe COPD (FEV1 18%) was no longer a candidate for active escalation of care. She was managed by the community palliative care team with low-dose oral morphine for dyspnoea and fan therapy. This approach successfully improved her quality of life and reduced anxiety-related breathlessness.

copd_014:
  primary_diagnosis: COPD Masking Underlying Bronchogenic Carcinoma
  presenting_complaint: New onset haemoptysis and persistent cough
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old smoker with known mild COPD presented with a change in his usual cough and one episode of blood-stained sputum. While initially thought to be an exacerbation, a chest X-ray revealed a 2cm hilar mass. Subsequent biopsy confirmed squamous cell carcinoma, highlighting the need for vigilance in this high-risk population.

copd_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening AECOPD with ICU Admission
  presenting_complaint: Respiratory arrest following severe wheeze
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male was brought to the ED in extremis with silent chest and cyanosis. He required emergency intubation and mechanical ventilation for 48 hours. After successful weaning, he was discharged with a revised management plan including high-dose ICS and home nebulisers.

copd_016:
  primary_diagnosis: COPD in a patient with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia
  presenting_complaint: Early-onset obstructive lung disease in a 28-year-old
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male, born at 25 weeks gestation, presented with progressive wheeze and exercise intolerance. Spirometry showed fixed airflow obstruction (FEV1/FVC 0.68) despite no smoking history. He was diagnosed with a COPD-like phenotype secondary to prematurity-related lung injury and started on LAMA therapy.

copd_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate COPD with GORD Comorbidity
  presenting_complaint: Frequent nocturnal cough and wheeze
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old female with COPD reported worsening symptoms particularly at night. Investigation revealed significant gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), which was acting as a trigger for her bronchospasm. Commencing a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and lifestyle changes led to a marked reduction in her COPD exacerbation frequency.

copd_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Occupational COPD (Coal Workers' Pneumoconiosis Overlap)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive shortness of breath and black sputum
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old retired coal miner presented with severe airflow obstruction and micronodular opacities on chest X-ray. The clinical picture was a combination of industrial dust exposure and cigarette smoking. He was managed with maximal bronchodilation and assisted with a successful claim for industrial injuries disablement benefit.

copd_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild COPD with Poor Treatment Adherence
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent "chest colds" and persistent wheeze
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male was diagnosed with mild COPD but frequently missed his maintenance ICS/LABA doses. He presented with a minor exacerbation triggered by a viral URTI. Following a structured review and the use of a digital inhaler tracker, his adherence improved, leading to better symptom control.

copd_020:
  primary_diagnosis: COPD with Congestive Heart Failure Overlap
  presenting_complaint: Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea and wheeze
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old male with a history of both COPD and ischaemic heart disease presented with acute breathlessness. Distinguishing between a COPD exacerbation and heart failure was challenging; however, an elevated NT-proBNP and response to IV furosemide confirmed a cardiac cause. His maintenance therapy was subsequently adjusted to include both cardioprotective and bronchodilator medications.
