autoimmune_hepatitis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 1 Autoimmune Hepatitis
  presenting_complaint: Lethargy, jaundice, and right upper quadrant discomfort.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female presented with a 3-week history of worsening fatigue and scleral icterus. Investigations revealed ALT 850 U/L, Bilirubin 65 µmol/L, and IgG 24 g/L, with positive ANA (1:160) and ASMA (1:80). Liver biopsy confirmed interface hepatitis with plasma cell infiltration, leading to a diagnosis of Type 1 AIH, which responded well to oral Prednisolone and subsequent Azathioprine maintenance.

autoimmune_hepatitis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 2 Autoimmune Hepatitis
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset jaundice and dark urine.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old girl was admitted with rapid-onset jaundice and vomiting. Laboratory tests showed ALT 1200 U/L and positive anti-LKM1 antibodies, while ANA and ASMA were negative. Despite initial high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone, her condition required the addition of Ciclosporin to achieve biochemical remission.

autoimmune_hepatitis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Decompensated Cirrhosis secondary to AIH
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal swelling and haematemesis.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old woman with no prior medical history presented with gross ascites and grade 1 oesophageal varices on endoscopy. Serology was positive for SMA and hypergammaglobulinaemia, and biopsy confirmed established cirrhosis with active necroinflammation. She was stabilised with diuretics, carvedilol, and low-dose Prednisolone, though she remains a candidate for liver transplant assessment.

autoimmune_hepatitis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Fulminant Autoimmune Hepatitis
  presenting_complaint: Confusion and deep jaundice.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male presented with Grade III hepatic encephalopathy and an INR of 2.8. He had no history of alcohol excess or paracetamol ingestion, but high-titer ANA and a characteristic liver biopsy suggested hyperacute AIH. He was transferred to the ICU and listed for super-urgent liver transplantation after failing to respond to 48 hours of intravenous steroids.

autoimmune_hepatitis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: AIH-PBC Overlap Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Generalised pruritus and fatigue.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female presented with persistent itching and an ALP of 450 U/L alongside an ALT of 320 U/L. Serology confirmed both AMA positivity and high-titer ASMA, while histology showed both florid duct lesions and interface hepatitis. She was successfully managed with a combination of Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and Budesonide.

autoimmune_hepatitis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic Autoimmune Hepatitis
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of deranged liver function tests.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male undergoing routine monitoring for hypertension was found to have an ALT of 95 U/L and AST of 88 U/L. Further workup revealed an IgG of 19 g/L and positive ANA (1:320), with biopsy showing moderate interface hepatitis (Ishak grade 3). Treatment with Budesonide was initiated to prevent progression to fibrosis despite the lack of symptoms.

autoimmune_hepatitis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Seronegative Autoimmune Hepatitis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of malaise and mild jaundice.
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old woman presented with fluctuating transaminases (ALT 200-400 U/L) but consistently negative ANA, ASMA, and anti-LKM1. A liver biopsy showed classic features of AIH including rosetting of hepatocytes and plasma cell rich infiltrates. She achieved complete biochemical remission following a trial of steroids, confirming the diagnosis of seronegative AIH.

autoimmune_hepatitis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Drug-Induced Autoimmune Hepatitis (DI-AIH)
  presenting_complaint: Nausea and tea-coloured urine.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old woman developed acute hepatitis six months after starting Nitrofurantoin for recurrent UTIs. Investigations showed ALT 600 U/L and positive ANA, with biopsy indistinguishable from idiopathic AIH. The drug was discontinued, and a short course of Prednisolone resulted in permanent resolution of LFT abnormalities without the need for long-term immunosuppression.

autoimmune_hepatitis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: AIH-PSC Overlap (Autoimmune Sclerosing Cholangitis)
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal pain and intermittent fever.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with known Ulcerative Colitis presented with a cholestatic liver profile (ALP 600 U/L, ALT 150 U/L). MRCP demonstrated "beading" of the intrahepatic bile ducts, while biopsy showed interface hepatitis and serology was positive for SMA. He was diagnosed with autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis and treated with a combination of Prednisolone and UDCA.

autoimmune_hepatitis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Autoimmune Hepatitis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent transaminitis despite treatment.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old woman previously diagnosed with Type 1 AIH failed to achieve remission on standard Azathioprine and Prednisolone therapy. Despite dose escalation and confirmed compliance, her ALT remained >200 U/L and repeat biopsy showed ongoing active inflammation. She was successfully transitioned to Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) as a second-line agent, finally achieving biochemical stability.

autoimmune_hepatitis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Postpartum Flare of Autoimmune Hepatitis
  presenting_complaint: Acute fatigue and jaundice 6 weeks post-delivery.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old woman with well-controlled AIH during pregnancy experienced a severe biochemical flare shortly after childbirth, with ALT rising to 900 U/L. Her maintenance dose of Azathioprine was increased and a temporary steroid taper was reintroduced. This highlights the high risk of postpartum exacerbation in AIH patients requiring close monitoring.

autoimmune_hepatitis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Autoimmune Hepatitis with Coeliac Disease
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss, bloating, and abnormal LFTs.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female was referred for investigation of iron-deficiency anaemia and an ALT of 140 U/L. Serology was positive for both anti-TTG and ASMA, and subsequent biopsies of the duodenum and liver confirmed Coeliac disease and AIH respectively. She was managed with a gluten-free diet and Azathioprine monotherapy, leading to resolution of both conditions.

autoimmune_hepatitis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) triggered by AIH
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice, oliguria, and confusion.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with undiagnosed compensated cirrhosis presented with sepsis and rapid liver failure (Bilirubin 400 µmol/L, Creatinine 180 µmol/L). Workup revealed high-titer ANA and IgG, suggesting an acute AIH flare on a background of chronic disease. Despite intensive care support and steroids, he developed multi-organ failure and passed away.

autoimmune_hepatitis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: AIH in a patient with HIV
  presenting_complaint: Routine monitoring showed rising transaminases.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male on stable antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV developed a new rise in ALT to 350 U/L. Viral hepatitis screens (A, B, C, E) were negative, but liver biopsy showed interface hepatitis and serology was positive for ANA. He was started on Prednisolone with careful monitoring of his CD4 count and viral load, achieving remission of the hepatitis.

autoimmune_hepatitis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Relapsing Autoimmune Hepatitis
  presenting_complaint: Return of fatigue and mild jaundice after stopping medication.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old woman who had been in biochemical remission for 3 years attempted a supervised withdrawal of immunosuppression. Within 4 months, her ALT rose to 500 U/L and symptoms returned. Treatment with Prednisolone was restarted, and she was counselled on the need for likely life-long Azathioprine maintenance.

autoimmune_hepatitis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 1 AIH with Azathioprine Intolerance
  presenting_complaint: Severe nausea and epigastric pain.
  summary_of_course: A 47-year-old female with AIH developed profound GI intolerance and a drop in white cell count shortly after starting Azathioprine. TPMT testing was normal, but she was unable to tolerate even low doses. She was switched to Tacrolimus as an alternative steroid-sparing agent, which maintained her ALT within the normal range.

autoimmune_hepatitis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild AIH in Elderly Patient
  presenting_complaint: Mild pruritus and joint pains.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male presented with polyarthralgia and an ALT of 70 U/L. Investigations showed a high IgG (22 g/L) and positive ANA (1:640), with biopsy confirming mild AIH (Ishak stage 1). Given his age and comorbidities (Type 2 diabetes), he was managed conservatively with low-dose Budesonide to minimise systemic steroid side effects.

autoimmune_hepatitis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent Autoimmune Hepatitis post-Transplant
  presenting_complaint: Rising transaminases 2 years post-liver transplant.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old woman who underwent transplantation for AIH-related cirrhosis developed a rise in ALT to 250 U/L. Graft biopsy showed interface hepatitis and plasma cells, consistent with recurrent AIH rather than rejection. Her immunosuppression was intensified with higher doses of Prednisolone and Mycophenolate, stabilising the graft function.

autoimmune_hepatitis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: AIH with concurrent Graves' Disease
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations, weight loss, and yellowing of the eyes.
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old female presented with thyrotoxicosis and concurrent hepatitis (ALT 550 U/L). Serology confirmed Graves' disease (positive TRAb) and AIH (positive ASMA, high IgG). She required Carbimazole for her thyroid and Prednisolone for her liver, illustrating the tendency of AIH to cluster with other autoimmune endocrinopathies.

autoimmune_hepatitis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: AIH with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
  presenting_complaint: Incidental LFT derangement in an obese patient.
  summary_of_course: A 53-year-old male with a BMI of 34 and metabolic syndrome was found to have an ALT of 110 U/L. While initially attributed to NAFLD, the persistence of LFT elevation led to further testing which revealed SMA positivity and high IgG. Biopsy showed a "dual pathology" of steatohepatitis and interface hepatitis, requiring both lifestyle modifications and immunosuppressant therapy.
