Diagnosis of essential hypertension was made, and management focused on intensive lifestyle modification and weight loss.

essential_hypertension_010:
  primary_diagnosis: White-coat Hypertension
  presenting_complaint: High BP readings only in the GP surgery
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female consistently recorded BP readings of 155/95 mmHg in the clinic, but appeared anxious. 24-hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) showed an average daytime BP of 122/78 mmHg. No antihypertensive treatment was initiated, but annual BP monitoring was recommended as she remains at higher risk of developing sustained hypertension.

essential_hypertension_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Masked Hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Target organ damage (LVH) despite normal clinic BP
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male presented with normal clinic BP (135/85 mmHg) but an ECG suggested LVH. HBPM revealed an average reading of 152/94 mmHg, confirming masked hypertension. Treatment was initiated with Perindopril to address the discrepancy and prevent further cardiovascular complications.

essential_hypertension_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypertensive Urgency
  presenting_complaint: Severe epistaxis and BP of 195/115 mmHg
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented to the Urgent Treatment Centre with a nosebleed that was difficult to control. BP was 195/115 mmHg without evidence of acute target organ damage (normal neurology, no chest pain, normal creatinine). Epistaxis was managed with packing, and his existing antihypertensive regimen was adjusted with urgent outpatient follow-up.
