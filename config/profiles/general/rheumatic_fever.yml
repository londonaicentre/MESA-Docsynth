rheumatic_fever_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Rheumatic Fever
  presenting_complaint: Migratory polyarthritis and fever
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old male presented with a 3-day history of shifting joint pain affecting the knees and ankles following a sore throat two weeks prior. Investigations revealed an elevated Antistreptolysin O (ASO) titre of 800 IU/mL and an ESR of 95 mm/hr. He was diagnosed with acute rheumatic fever based on Jones criteria and successfully treated with a course of phenoxymethylpenicillin and aspirin.

rheumatic_fever_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Rheumatic Carditis with Heart Failure
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath and palpitations
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old female presented with progressive dyspnoea and orthopnoea. Clinical examination identified a new pansystolic murmur at the apex and hepatomegaly, with echocardiography confirming severe mitral regurgitation and a dilated left atrium. She required admission for intravenous furosemide and prednisolone, alongside long-term penicillin prophylaxis.

rheumatic_fever_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Sydenham's Chorea
  presenting_complaint: Involuntary jerky movements and emotional lability
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old girl was brought to the paediatric clinic with sudden onset purposeless movements of her arms and facial grimacing. Her parents noted recent school performance decline and irritability. Despite no active arthritis, her history of a recent febrile illness and positive streptococcal serology confirmed the diagnosis, and she was started on carbamazepine for symptom control.

rheumatic_fever_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Rheumatic Fever with Erythema Marginatum
  presenting_complaint: Transient pink skin rings and mild joint aches
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old boy presented with non-pruritic, erythematous rings on his trunk and proximal limbs. Physical exam also noted small, painless subcutaneous nodules over the extensor surfaces of his elbows. Diagnosis of rheumatic fever was made following ECG evidence of a prolonged PR interval, and he was managed in the community with close cardiac monitoring.

rheumatic_fever_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Adult-Onset Acute Rheumatic Fever
  presenting_complaint: Severe bilateral knee pain and fever
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male presented to A&E with debilitating joint pain that migrated from his right wrist to both knees over 48 hours. Initial suspicion of reactive arthritis was revised to acute rheumatic fever after a rapid streptococcal antigen test was positive and ASO titres were significantly elevated. He responded rapidly to high-dose naproxen.

rheumatic_fever_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent Rheumatic Fever
  presenting_complaint: Recurrence of joint pain and lethargy
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old female with a known history of rheumatic fever at age 9 presented with a new episode of polyarthritis. She admitted to non-compliance with her monthly benzathine penicillin injections for the past six months. Investigations showed a new first-degree heart block on ECG, necessitating re-stabilisation and intensive education on the importance of secondary prophylaxis.

rheumatic_fever_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Fulminant Rheumatic Pancarditis
  presenting_complaint: Acute respiratory distress and chest pain
  summary_of_course: A 9-year-old male was admitted to the ICU with life-threatening heart failure and a pericardial rub. Echocardiography demonstrated pericardial effusion, severe mitral regurgitation, and impaired left ventricular function. He was treated with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids and supportive inotropes, eventually requiring a mitral valve repair after the acute inflammatory phase subsided.

rheumatic_fever_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute Rheumatic Fever
  presenting_complaint: Persistent low-grade fever and malaise
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old male presented with a 3-week history of fatigue and intermittent low-grade pyrexia. While joint symptoms were mild arthralgia rather than frank arthritis, an ECG performed due to a soft murmur revealed a prolonged PR interval of 220ms. Diagnosis was confirmed via rising ASO titres, and he was started on a prophylactic penicillin regimen.

rheumatic_fever_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Rheumatic Heart Disease
  presenting_complaint: Exertional dyspnoea and irregular pulse
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with a childhood history of rheumatic fever presented with worsening breathlessness. Examination revealed atrial fibrillation and a mid-diastolic rumble at the apex, consistent with mitral stenosis. She was managed with anticoagulation and scheduled for a percutaneous mitral commissurotomy.

rheumatic_fever_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Rheumatic Fever presenting as Monoarthritis
  presenting_complaint: Severe right hip pain and inability to weight-bear
  summary_of_course: An 11-year-old girl presented with acute hip pain, initially raising concerns for septic arthritis. However, joint aspiration was sterile, and the pain migrated to the left ankle within 24 hours. Subsequent positive throat culture for Group A Streptococcus and elevated inflammatory markers led to a diagnosis of rheumatic fever.

rheumatic_fever_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Rheumatic Fever with Comorbid Asthma
  presenting_complaint: Wheezing and chest tightness
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old boy with known asthma presented with what was initially thought to be an asthma exacerbation. Lack of response to bronchodilators and the presence of a new gallop rhythm prompted an ECHO, which showed acute myocarditis. Elevated streptococcal antibodies confirmed rheumatic fever as the underlying cause of his cardiac symptoms.

rheumatic_fever_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-Streptococcal Sequelae Overlap
  presenting_complaint: Joint swelling and dark-coloured urine
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy presented with migratory arthritis and macroscopic haematuria. Clinical workup confirmed a rare concurrent presentation of acute rheumatic fever and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Management required careful fluid balance for his nephritis while treating the rheumatic carditis identified on screening echocardiography.

rheumatic_fever_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Rheumatic Carditis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent tachycardia and fever despite treatment
  summary_of_course: A 13-year-old female diagnosed with rheumatic carditis failed to improve after two weeks of high-dose aspirin and oral prednisolone. Her ESR remained above 100 mm/hr and cardiac failure markers increased. She was transitioned to intravenous methylprednisolone pulses and eventually required the addition of methotrexate to achieve clinical remission.

rheumatic_fever_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Advanced Rheumatic Heart Disease in a Migrant Patient
  presenting_complaint: Poor growth and chronic cough
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy recently arrived from a high-prevalence region presented with failure to thrive and signs of chronic heart failure. Imaging revealed multi-valvular involvement with severe mitral and aortic regurgitation. He underwent urgent double valve replacement and was started on lifelong warfarin and penicillin prophylaxis.

rheumatic_fever_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Acute Rheumatic Fever
  presenting_complaint: Transient ankle pain and low-grade fever
  summary_of_course: A 9-year-old girl presented with mild swelling of the left ankle that resolved within 24 hours, followed by similar pain in the right wrist. Despite the mild nature, her ASO titre was 1200 IU/mL and ECG showed borderline PR prolongation. She was managed as an outpatient with bed rest and a short course of NSAIDs.

rheumatic_fever_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Isolated Sydenham's Chorea (Edge Case)
  presenting_complaint: Facial tics and "clumsiness"
  summary_of_course: An 11-year-old male was referred by his school for suspected ADHD or Tourette's syndrome due to recent onset fidgeting and dropping objects. Neurological assessment identified the "milkmaid's grip" and fasciculations of the tongue. Despite a normal echocardiogram and no history of arthritis, his streptococcal serology confirmed isolated Sydenham's chorea.

rheumatic_fever_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Rheumatic Heart Disease in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Severe breathlessness in the second trimester
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old pregnant female with previously undiagnosed rheumatic mitral stenosis presented at 24 weeks gestation with pulmonary oedema. The physiological increase in blood volume during pregnancy led to acute decompensation of her stenotic valve. She was managed with bed rest, beta-blockers, and diuretics, with a planned multidisciplinary delivery.

rheumatic_fever_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent Rheumatic Fever with Penicillin Allergy
  presenting_complaint: Fever and polyarthritis
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old girl with a known severe penicillin allergy presented with her second episode of rheumatic fever. She had been prescribed erythromycin for secondary prophylaxis but had been poorly compliant due to gastrointestinal side effects. Her acute episode was managed with clarithromycin and aspirin, and her prophylaxis was switched to azithromycin.

rheumatic_fever_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Rheumatic Heart Disease with Infective Endocarditis
  presenting_complaint: Prolonged fever and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with chronic rheumatic mitral regurgitation presented with a 4-week history of night sweats and a new splinter haemorrhage. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridans, and ECHO showed a 1cm vegetation on the damaged mitral valve. He required 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics for endocarditis complicating his underlying rheumatic heart disease.

rheumatic_fever_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Silent Rheumatic Carditis with Embolic Stroke
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset right-sided weakness
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old male presented with an acute ischaemic stroke. Investigations revealed he was in atrial fibrillation, and an echocardiogram showed significant mitral valve scarring and a left atrial thrombus, despite no prior diagnosis of rheumatic fever. This "silent" carditis case highlights the risk of late-stage complications in undiagnosed rheumatic fever.
