hypokalaemia_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Thiazide-induced hypokalaemia
  presenting_complaint: Routine medication review, asymptomatic
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old female with hypertension treated with bendroflumethiazide was found to have a serum potassium of 3.2 mmol/L during routine monitoring. She reported no muscle weakness or palpitations. The diuretic dose was reduced, and she was started on oral potassium supplements with normalisation of levels within two weeks.

hypokalaemia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe hypokalaemia secondary to acute gastroenteritis
  presenting_complaint: Profuse watery diarrhoea and profound generalised weakness
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male presented with a three-day history of viral gastroenteritis and significant dehydration. Blood tests revealed a potassium of 2.4 mmol/L and a metabolic acidosis. He was treated with intravenous fluid resuscitation and potassium chloride infusions, leading to rapid symptomatic improvement.

hypokalaemia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Gitelman syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Chronic fatigue and intermittent carpopedal spasms
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female with a history of persistent low potassium since adolescence was investigated for recurrent cramps. Investigations showed a potassium of 2.7 mmol/L, hypomagnesaemia, and hypocalciuria, consistent with Gitelman syndrome. She requires lifelong high-dose oral potassium and magnesium supplementation.

hypokalaemia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset lower limb paralysis following a high-carbohydrate meal
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male of East Asian descent presented to A&E with acute inability to walk. Laboratory results showed a life-threatening potassium of 1.8 mmol/L and suppressed TSH. He was treated with cautious intravenous potassium replacement and propranolol to prevent rebound hyperkalaemia as the intracellular shift reversed.

hypokalaemia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-operative hypokalaemia
  presenting_complaint: Post-surgical ileus and nasogastric tube drainage
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male underwent a major hemicolectomy and required prolonged nasogastric suctioning post-operatively. His potassium dropped to 2.9 mmol/L due to gastric fluid losses and inadequate maintenance fluids. The potassium deficit was corrected via central line supplementation, and levels stabilised once enteral feeding resumed.

hypokalaemia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Insulin-induced hypokalaemia in Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)
  presenting_complaint: Polyuria, polydipsia, and vomiting
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female with Type 1 diabetes presented in DKA with a baseline potassium of 3.6 mmol/L. Following the initiation of fixed-rate insulin infusion, her potassium plummeted to 2.8 mmol/L due to intracellular shifting. Intensive potassium replacement was added to her intravenous fluids according to national DKA protocols to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.

hypokalaemia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Resistant hypertension and nocturnal polyuria
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with hypertension requiring four agents was found to have a persistent potassium of 2.9 mmol/L. Further testing revealed a high aldosterone-to-renin ratio and a left-sided adrenal adenoma on CT. Following a laparoscopic adrenalectomy, his potassium normalised and his blood pressure became easily controlled.

hypokalaemia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic hypokalaemia in Heart Failure
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations and increased shortness of breath
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female on high-dose furosemide for congestive cardiac failure presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Her potassium was 2.5 mmol/L, exacerbated by recent laxative overuse. She was treated with intravenous potassium and magnesium, which facilitated successful pharmacological cardioversion.

hypokalaemia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric hypokalaemia due to Cystic Fibrosis
  presenting_complaint: Heat exhaustion and lethargy during a summer heatwave
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy with cystic fibrosis was brought to the paediatric assessment unit with dehydration. Excessive salt loss in sweat led to a potassium of 3.0 mmol/L and a metabolic alkalosis. He was managed with oral rehydration salts and temporary potassium supplementation until his clinical status improved.

hypokalaemia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypokalaemia secondary to Bulimia Nervosa
  presenting_complaint: Fainting episodes and dental enamel erosion
  summary_of_course: A 20-year-old female was referred by her GP after bloods showed a potassium of 2.2 mmol/L. She admitted to frequent self-induced vomiting and diuretic misuse for weight control. She was admitted for medically stabilising potassium replacement and referred to a specialist eating disorder service for multidisciplinary care.

hypokalaemia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Cisplatin-induced renal potassium wasting
  presenting_complaint: Generalised malaise following chemotherapy
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male receiving cisplatin for lung cancer developed moderate hypokalaemia of 2.7 mmol/L. The chemotherapy caused renal tubular damage leading to significant urinary potassium and magnesium loss. He required aggressive electrolyte replacement before subsequent cycles of chemotherapy could proceed safely.

hypokalaemia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Digoxin toxicity exacerbated by hypokalaemia
  presenting_complaint: Nausea, yellow-tinted vision, and bradycardia
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old female on digoxin for atrial fibrillation was admitted with a potassium of 2.5 mmol/L following a bout of diarrhoea. The low potassium potentiated digoxin binding, leading to symptomatic toxicity despite a borderline therapeutic digoxin level. Treatment involved potassium correction and temporary cessation of digoxin under cardiac monitoring.

hypokalaemia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory hypokalaemia due to hypomagnesaemia
  presenting_complaint: Chronic alcohol dependence and tremors
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with alcohol misuse disorder presented with a potassium of 2.8 mmol/L. Initial attempts at potassium replacement failed to raise serum levels until his concomitant magnesium deficiency (0.4 mmol/L) was identified and treated. Once magnesium was replaced, the renal potassium wasting ceased and serum potassium normalised.

hypokalaemia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Liddle syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Early-onset hypertension in a teenager
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old male was investigated for a blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg and a potassium of 2.6 mmol/L. Genetic testing confirmed Liddle syndrome, a rare condition involving overactive epithelial sodium channels. He was successfully treated with amiloride, which specifically targets the channel, resolving both the hypertension and the hypokalaemia.

hypokalaemia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Salbutamol-induced hypokalaemia
  presenting_complaint: Acute exacerbation of asthma
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old female required back-to-back nebulised salbutamol and an intravenous aminophylline infusion for life-threatening asthma. Her potassium dropped from 4.1 mmol/L to 3.1 mmol/L within four hours due to beta-agonist-induced intracellular shift. The hypokalaemia was transient and resolved without specific treatment as the frequency of nebulisers was reduced.

hypokalaemia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Distal Renal Tubular Acidosis (Type 1 RTA)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent kidney stones and bone pain
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female with Sjögren's syndrome was found to have a potassium of 2.5 mmol/L and a hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis with a high urinary pH. Diagnosis of distal RTA was made, and she was started on Shohl's solution (sodium citrate/potassium citrate). This treatment corrected her acidosis and maintained her potassium within the reference range.

hypokalaemia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Pseudohyperaldosteronism due to liquorice ingestion
  presenting_complaint: New-onset hypertension and leg oedema
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male presented with a potassium of 2.3 mmol/L and significant hypertension. History revealed he had been consuming 200g of natural black liquorice daily for several months. The glycyrrhizic acid inhibited 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, mimicking mineralocorticoid excess; symptoms resolved six weeks after stopping the liquorice.

hypokalaemia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Refeeding syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Severe malnutrition and alcohol withdrawal
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old malnourished male was started on high-calorie enteral nutrition upon hospital admission. Within 48 hours, his potassium fell from 3.5 mmol/L to 2.4 mmol/L, accompanied by a drop in phosphate and magnesium. Feeding was slowed, and aggressive electrolyte replacement was initiated to prevent cardiac collapse and respiratory failure.

hypokalaemia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Villous adenoma of the rectum
  presenting_complaint: Chronic passage of large volumes of rectal mucus
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male presented with a three-month history of "mucoid diarrhoea" and progressive lethargy. Blood tests showed a potassium of 2.6 mmol/L and a metabolic alkalosis. Colonoscopy identified a large, secreting villous adenoma in the rectum; surgical resection of the polyp resulted in complete resolution of the electrolyte imbalance.

hypokalaemia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute barium poisoning
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive ascending paralysis after accidental ingestion
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old factory worker was admitted to the ICU after accidentally ingesting barium carbonate. He developed profound hypokalaemia (1.9 mmol/L) due to barium-induced blockade of potassium exit channels in muscle cells. He required massive doses of intravenous potassium (up to 40 mmol/hour) under continuous ECG monitoring to restore neuromuscular function.
