pulmonary_stenosis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Critical congenital pulmonary stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Neonatal cyanosis and respiratory distress
  summary_of_course: A 2-day-old neonate presented with worsening cyanosis and poor feeding. Echocardiography revealed critical valvular pulmonary stenosis with a pin-hole orifice and right-to-left shunting across the foramen ovale. The infant was stabilised with a prostaglandin E1 infusion to maintain ductal patency before undergoing successful urgent balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty.

pulmonary_stenosis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild valvular pulmonary stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic systolic murmur
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male was referred following a routine medical examination for a heavy goods vehicle licence. Examination noted a grade 2/6 ejection systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border with an audible ejection click. Echocardiography confirmed mild valvular PS with a peak gradient of 28 mmHg and normal right ventricular function; he remains under five-yearly outpatient surveillance.

pulmonary_stenosis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe dysplastic pulmonary stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Exertional dyspnoea and fatigue
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old female with Noonan syndrome presented with increasing shortness of breath during physical education classes. Investigations showed a thickened, dysplastic pulmonary valve with a peak transvalvular gradient of 75 mmHg and significant right ventricular hypertrophy. Due to the dysplastic nature of the valve, she underwent surgical pulmonary valvotomy rather than balloon dilatation, with good symptomatic recovery.

pulmonary_stenosis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate calcific pulmonary stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Progressive breathlessness on exertion
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female with a history of hypertension presented with NYHA Class II breathlessness. Transthoracic echocardiography identified moderate calcific pulmonary valve stenosis with a peak gradient of 45 mmHg and mild tricuspid regurgitation. Management focused on diuretic therapy for peripheral oedema and annual echocardiographic monitoring of the valve gradient.

pulmonary_stenosis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Supravalvular pulmonary stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Failure to thrive and heart murmur
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old male with Williams syndrome was evaluated for poor weight gain and a harsh systolic murmur. Cardiac catheterisation and CT angiography confirmed significant supravalvular pulmonary stenosis involving the main pulmonary artery segment. He was referred for surgical patch angioplasty of the pulmonary artery to relieve the obstruction.

pulmonary_stenosis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent chest infections and exercise intolerance
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old girl with Alagille syndrome was investigated for persistent exercise intolerance. Imaging revealed multiple bilateral stenoses at the bifurcations of the peripheral pulmonary arteries. She underwent sequential percutaneous stent placements in the most severely affected lobar branches, resulting in improved pulmonary perfusion scans.

pulmonary_stenosis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe valvular pulmonary stenosis with right heart failure
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal swelling and bilateral leg oedema
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented with gross ascites and pitting oedema to the mid-thigh. Echocardiography demonstrated severe pulmonary stenosis with a peak gradient of 90 mmHg, severe right ventricular dilatation, and reduced systolic function. He was treated with intensive intravenous diuretics before undergoing successful percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty.

pulmonary_stenosis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Subvalvular infundibular pulmonary stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Chest pain and near-syncope during exercise
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male with known hypertrophic cardiomyopathy presented with exertional pre-syncope. Investigations identified dynamic subvalvular pulmonary stenosis caused by right ventricular infundibular hypertrophy. Symptoms were initially managed with beta-blockers, but persistent gradients necessitated a surgical myectomy of the right ventricular outflow tract.

pulmonary_stenosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Residual pulmonary stenosis post-Tetralogy of Fallot repair
  presenting_complaint: Routine follow-up for congenital heart disease
  summary_of_course: An 18-year-old male, who had a total repair of Tetralogy of Fallot in infancy, presented for annual review. Cardiac MRI showed significant residual stenosis at the site of the previous transannular patch with a peak gradient of 52 mmHg and moderate right ventricular enlargement. He was scheduled for elective percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation (PPVI) to address the combined stenosis and regurgitation.

pulmonary_stenosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Carcinoid pulmonary stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Flushing, diarrhoea, and worsening breathlessness
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female with a metastatic neuroendocrine tumour presented with signs of right heart failure. Echocardiography revealed characteristic fibrous thickening of the pulmonary valve leaflets leading to severe stenosis and concomitant regurgitation. Following stabilisation of her carcinoid syndrome with octreotide, she was referred for bioprosthetic pulmonary valve replacement.

pulmonary_stenosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate pulmonary stenosis in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations and dyspnoea at 24 weeks gestation
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old pregnant woman with previously known moderate PS presented with increased symptomatic burden. Clinical review showed a stable peak gradient of 48 mmHg on echocardiography, with symptoms attributed to the physiological demands of pregnancy. She was managed conservatively with restricted activity and close obstetric-cardiology multidisciplinary follow-up, delivering successfully at term.

pulmonary_stenosis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Infective endocarditis on stenotic pulmonary valve
  presenting_complaint: Persistent fever and new-onset malaise
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old male with known mild congenital PS presented with a two-week history of pyrexia of unknown origin. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridans, and transoesophageal echocardiography showed a 1cm vegetation on the stenotic pulmonary valve. He completed a six-week course of intravenous benzylpenicillin and gentamicin, with repeat imaging showing resolution of the vegetation but a slight increase in the valvular gradient.

pulmonary_stenosis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe pulmonary stenosis with atrial septal defect
  presenting_complaint: Exertional cyanosis
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female presented with blue discolouration of the lips during strenuous activity. Investigations revealed severe valvular PS (gradient 85 mmHg) and a large secundum atrial septal defect with right-to-left shunting due to high right-sided pressures. She underwent a combined procedure involving balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty followed by percutaneous ASD closure once right ventricular pressures had fallen.

pulmonary_stenosis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Radiation-induced pulmonary stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Late-onset exertional dyspnoea
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male, who received mediastinal radiotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma 20 years prior, presented with progressive breathlessness. Imaging confirmed heavy calcification of the pulmonary valve and proximal pulmonary artery, resulting in severe stenosis. Given the high surgical risk due to previous radiation, he was successfully treated with a transcatheter pulmonary valve intervention.

pulmonary_stenosis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic pulmonary stenosis decompensation
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of breathlessness following viral illness
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old with known moderate PS presented to A&E with acute respiratory distress following a flu-like prodrome. He was found to be in atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response, which acutely compromised his right ventricular output. Following electrical cardioversion and fluid optimisation, his symptoms returned to baseline, and he was fast-tracked for balloon valvuloplasty.

pulmonary_stenosis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Failed balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty
  presenting_complaint: Persistent high gradients post-intervention
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old boy underwent balloon valvuloplasty for severe PS, but post-procedural echocardiography showed a residual peak gradient of 65 mmHg. Subsequent review suggested a significant subvalvular muscular component that was not amenable to balloon dilatation. He was subsequently referred for surgical infundibular resection and valvotomy.

pulmonary_stenosis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic pulmonary stenosis (pulmonary artery banding)
  presenting_complaint: Planned review for staged VSD repair
  summary_of_course: A 2-year-old child with a previous pulmonary artery band for a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) was assessed for definitive repair. The band had successfully limited pulmonary over-circulation but now created a significant iatrogenic stenosis with a gradient of 70 mmHg. The patient underwent VSD closure and band removal with pulmonary artery reconstruction.

pulmonary_stenosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Rheumatic pulmonary stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Multi-valvular heart disease symptoms
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male originally from an endemic area presented with symptoms of mixed mitral and aortic valve disease. Detailed echocardiography also identified thickened, restricted pulmonary valve leaflets with moderate stenosis, consistent with rheumatic involvement. He underwent triple valve surgery, including pulmonary valvuloplasty, as part of a comprehensive surgical plan.

pulmonary_stenosis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe pulmonary stenosis with paradoxical embolism
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset left-sided weakness
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male with undiagnosed severe PS presented with an acute ischaemic stroke. Investigations revealed a patent foramen ovale (PFO) with right-to-left shunting driven by the high right ventricular pressures from the pulmonary stenosis. After neurological stabilisation, he underwent balloon valvuloplasty and subsequent PFO closure to prevent further embolic events.

pulmonary_stenosis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild pulmonary stenosis in a professional athlete
  presenting_complaint: Abnormal ECG during sports screening
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old professional footballer was found to have right ventricular hypertrophy patterns on a screening ECG. Echocardiography demonstrated mild valvular pulmonary stenosis with a peak gradient of 22 mmHg and a normal sized right ventricle. Following a specialist sports cardiology review and a normal exercise stress test, he was cleared for competitive play with annual cardiac monitoring.
