  primary_diagnosis: Hip fracture complicated by delirium and pneumonia
  presenting_complaint: Confusion and inability to mobilised post-fall.
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old female was admitted with a displaced intracapsular fracture. Her post-operative course following hemiarthroplasty was complicated by hyperactive delirium and aspiration pneumonia. She required intensive multidisciplinary input from orthogeriatrics and SALT, leading to a prolonged hospital stay of 24 days.

fracture_of_hip_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Impacted valgus femoral neck fracture
  presenting_complaint: Mild discomfort in the left hip but able to limp.
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old female presented two days after a trip. X-rays revealed a Garden Type I impacted valgus fracture of the femoral neck. Due to the inherent stability, she was initially managed with restricted weight bearing, but subsequent displacement at 10 days necessitated internal fixation.

fracture_of_hip_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Bilateral femoral neck fractures
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of bilateral hip pain following a tonic-clonic seizure.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male with poorly controlled epilepsy presented with bilateral hip pain after a nocturnal seizure. CT imaging revealed bilateral impacted femoral neck fractures caused by intense muscle contractions. He underwent bilateral cannulated screw fixation and was referred for an urgent neurology review to optimise anti-epileptic medication.
