left_ventricular_failure_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF)
  presenting_complaint: Gradual increase in exertional dyspnoea and fatigue.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female smoker was reviewed in the community heart failure clinic with a six-month history of reduced exercise tolerance. Echocardiography demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 32% with global hypokinesis. She was commenced on quadruple therapy including an ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, MRA, and SGLT2 inhibitor, resulting in NYHA class improvement from III to II.

left_ventricular_failure_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic Left Ventricular Failure
  presenting_complaint: Worsening breathlessness and peripheral oedema triggered by palpitations.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with known dilated cardiomyopathy presented with a three-day history of palpitations and decompensated heart failure. ECG confirmed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response of 145 bpm, precipitating the acute LVF. He underwent rate control with IV digoxin and diuresis with furosemide, followed by successful elective DC cardioversion.

left_ventricular_failure_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Dilated Cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Poor feeding, tachypnoea, and failure to thrive.
  summary_of_course: An 8-month-old infant presented to paediatrics with respiratory distress and hepatomegaly following a viral prodrome. Echocardiography revealed a severely dilated left ventricle with an LVEF of 20%, consistent with post-viral myocarditis leading to LVF. The patient was managed in PICU with milrinone and later transitioned to oral carvedilol and captopril.

left_ventricular_failure_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Cardiogenic Shock secondary to Acute Myocardial Infarction
  presenting_complaint: Severe chest pain, diaphoresis, and hypotension.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented with an anterior STEMI and rapidly progressed to cardiogenic shock with a BP of 80/50 mmHg. Urgent PCI to the LAD was performed, but he remained in severe LVF requiring intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support and dobutamine infusion in the ICU. He survived to discharge but remains with a severely impaired LVEF.

left_ventricular_failure_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Flash Pulmonary Oedema
  presenting_complaint: Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea and hypertensive crisis.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female with renovascular hypertension presented with sudden-onset, life-threatening breathlessness and a BP of 220/120 mmHg. Rapid diuresis and GTN infusion were administered to reduce afterload and clear pulmonary congestion. Subsequent investigation revealed bilateral renal artery stenosis as the precipitant for her recurrent flash pulmonary oedema.

left_ventricular_failure_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF)
  presenting_complaint: Breathlessness on exertion and ankle swelling.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old obese female with long-standing hypertension and Type 2 diabetes presented with NYHA Class III symptoms. Echocardiography showed an LVEF of 55% but significant diastolic dysfunction and left atrial enlargement, with an elevated NT-proBNP of 1,200 pg/mL. Management focused on weight loss, BP control, and SGLT2 inhibitor therapy.

left_ventricular_failure_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Peripartum Cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Orthopnoea and cough in the third trimester of pregnancy.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old previously healthy woman presented at 36 weeks gestation with symptoms initially mistaken for normal pregnancy-related breathlessness. Severe LVF was diagnosed via echo showing an LVEF of 25%, necessitating an emergency C-section. She was treated with bromocriptine, diuretics, and beta-blockers, with partial recovery of LV function at six months.

left_ventricular_failure_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Valvular Left Ventricular Failure
  presenting_complaint: Exertional syncope and dyspnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male presented with classic symptoms of aortic stenosis-induced LVF. Examination revealed a loud ejection systolic murmur and a slow-rising pulse, while the echo confirmed a valve area of 0.7 cm². He underwent a successful Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI), which led to a significant reduction in pulmonary pressures and symptomatic relief.

left_ventricular_failure_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Cardiorenal Syndrome Type 1
  presenting_complaint: Fluid overload with decreasing urine output.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with chronic LVF was admitted with an exacerbation and concurrent Acute Kidney Injury (AKI). High-dose IV loop diuretics led to worsening uraemia, complicating the management of his pulmonary congestion. He eventually required a period of ultrafiltration to manage the fluid overload while cautiously titrating his heart failure medications.

left_ventricular_failure_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Anthracycline-Induced Cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue and mild dyspnoea two years post-chemotherapy.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old breast cancer survivor presented with subacute LVF following previous treatment with Doxorubicin. Surveillance echocardiography showed a drop in LVEF from 60% to 35% without ischaemic cause. She was commenced on Enalapril and Bisoprolol, showing a modest improvement in cardiac function over 12 months.

left_ventricular_failure_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Silent Left Ventricular Failure
  presenting_complaint: Unexplained lethargy and reduced appetite.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes presented with non-specific constitutional symptoms rather than overt breathlessness. Investigations revealed an NT-proBNP of 3,500 pg/mL and significant cardiomegaly on CXR. The diagnosis of silent LVF was made, likely secondary to diabetic cardiomyopathy and asymptomatic ischaemia.

left_ventricular_failure_013:
  primary_diagnosis: LVF with Secondary Mitral Regurgitation
  presenting_complaint: Severe breathlessness and holosystolic murmur.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female with previous myocardial infarction presented with worsening LVF symptoms. Echocardiography revealed left ventricular dilatation causing tethering of the mitral valve leaflets and severe functional mitral regurgitation. Despite optimal medical therapy, she remained symptomatic and was referred for a Percutaneous Mitral Valve Edge-to-Edge Repair (MitraClip).

left_ventricular_failure_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcohol-Induced Cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal bloating and shortness of breath.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with a 20-year history of heavy alcohol consumption presented with signs of biventricular failure. Echocardiography showed a severely dilated LV with an LVEF of 15% and secondary right-sided failure. Following total abstinence from alcohol and standard HF therapy, his LVEF improved to 40% within one year.

left_ventricular_failure_015:
  primary_diagnosis: LVF secondary to Cardiac Amyloidosis
  presenting_complaint: Progressive dyspnoea and light-headedness.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male presented with symptoms of LVF but was found to have low voltage on ECG despite thickened ventricular walls on echo (the "sparkling" myocardium appearance). Bone scintigraphy (DPD scan) confirmed ATTR amyloidosis. He was started on tafamidis and cautious diuretic therapy, as he was highly sensitive to preload changes.

left_ventricular_failure_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Left Ventricular Failure
  presenting_complaint: Persistent NYHA Class IV symptoms despite maximal therapy.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with end-stage ischaemic cardiomyopathy remained bedbound with breathlessness despite quadruple therapy and cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT). He was evaluated for advanced therapies and subsequently underwent implantation of a Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) as a bridge to transplantation.

left_ventricular_failure_017:
  primary_diagnosis: LVF presenting as Nocturnal Cough
  presenting_complaint: Persistent dry cough at night for three months.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old female was initially treated for asthma and GORD without success for her nocturnal cough. Further review revealed the cough only occurred when lying flat and was accompanied by fine basal crackles. An echocardiogram confirmed moderate LVF with an LVEF of 38%, and her "asthma" symptoms resolved completely with diuretic therapy.

left_ventricular_failure_018:
  primary_diagnosis: High-Output Heart Failure
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations, warmth, and breathlessness.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female with untreated Graves' disease presented with signs of LVF including pulmonary congestion and peripheral oedema. Unlike typical LVF, she had a hyperdynamic circulation and an elevated LVEF of 75%. Management involved treating the underlying thyrotoxicosis and using beta-blockers to control the heart rate and metabolic demand.

left_ventricular_failure_019:
  primary_diagnosis: LVF with Complex Comorbidities (CKD and Anaemia)
  presenting_complaint: Severe lethargy and exertional dyspnoea.
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old male with Stage 4 CKD and chronic anaemia presented with decompensated LVF. His management was complicated by the inability to use ACE inhibitors due to hyperkalaemia and the need for erythropoietin to manage his anaemia. He was managed with hydralazine and nitrates as an alternative for afterload reduction.

left_ventricular_failure_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Tachycardia-Induced Cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Rapid heart rate and progressive breathlessness.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male presented with a constant heart rate of 130 bpm due to persistent atrial flutter and subsequent LVF. Echocardiography showed an LVEF of 30%. Following a successful catheter ablation of the flutter circuit, his heart rate normalised, and a repeat echocardiogram three months later showed a completely recovered LVEF of 55%.
