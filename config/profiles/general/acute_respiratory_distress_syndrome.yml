  presenting_complaint: Shaking chills, high fever, and rapidly worsening shortness of breath.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with known nephrolithiasis presented with E. coli bacteraemia and distributive shock. Within 12 hours of admission, he developed profound hypoxaemia (PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 85 mmHg) and bilateral alveolar opacities on chest X-ray. He required urgent intubation, lung-protective ventilation, and prone positioning in the ICU, eventually recovering after a 14-day ventilator course.

  primary_diagnosis: Moderate ARDS following gastric aspiration
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of respiratory distress and coughing after a vomiting episode.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old female with advanced dementia was admitted following a witnessed aspiration event at her care home. She developed progressive tachypnoea and a requirement for 60% oxygen to maintain saturations above 90%.

  presenting_complaint: Ten-day history of cough, fever, and progressive exertional dyspnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with a BMI of 36 and Type 2 diabetes presented with bilateral viral pneumonia.

  primary_diagnosis: Severe ARDS secondary to acute pancreatitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe epigastric pain radiating to the back and new-onset breathlessness.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with chronic alcohol excess was admitted with necrotising pancreatitis. On day 3, he developed Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) and acute lung injury with a PaO2/FiO2 of 95 mmHg. He required multi-organ support in the ICU, including haemofiltration for acute kidney injury and neuromuscular blockade to facilitate ventilation.

acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild ARDS due to bilateral lung contusions
  presenting_complaint: Chest pain and shortness of breath following a road traffic accident.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female sustained a flail chest and multiple rib fractures in a high-speed collision. Initial imaging showed patchy contusions which progressed over 48 hours into diffuse bilateral infiltrates. She was managed with high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) and thoracic epidural analgesia, maintaining a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 240 mmHg without needing intubation.

acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe ARDS following smoke inhalation
  presenting_complaint: Exposure to heavy smoke in a house fire, cough, and soot-stained sputum.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male was rescued from a domestic fire with significant inhalational injury but no cutaneous burns. He developed progressive airway oedema and severe ARDS within 18 hours due to chemical pneumonitis from toxic fumes. Due to refractory hypoxaemia despite maximal ventilation, he was referred for Venovenous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (VV-ECMO).

acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate ARDS secondary to Fat Embolism Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, petechial rash, and respiratory distress 24 hours after a leg injury.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male suffered a closed femoral shaft fracture in a sporting accident. One day post-injury, he became acutely confused and hypoxic with a characteristic petechial rash on his axilla and neck. Chest imaging showed "snowstorm" infiltrates consistent with fat embolism, requiring a 5-day course of mechanical ventilation.

  primary_diagnosis: Mild ARDS in an immunocompromised host (PJP)
  presenting_complaint: Subacute onset of dry cough and exertional desaturation over two weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male, recently diagnosed with HIV (CD4 count 45), presented with progressive dyspnoea. Investigations confirmed Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 280 mmHg. He was treated with high-dose co-trimoxazole and adjuvant prednisolone, showing slow but steady improvement over 10 days.

acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute ARDS-like drug-induced lung injury
  presenting_complaint: Persistent cough and worsening breathlessness over three weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female on long-term amiodarone for atrial fibrillation presented with new bilateral pulmonary opacities. Extensive workup for infection and heart failure was negative, and a diagnosis of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity was made. The clinical picture mimicked subacute ARDS, requiring high-dose corticosteroids and cessation of the offending agent.

  primary_diagnosis: Post-bypass ARDS (Pump Lung)
  presenting_complaint: Failure to wean from the ventilator following cardiac surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male underwent complex mitral valve replacement and CABG with a prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time of 210 minutes. Post-operatively, he developed diffuse alveolar damage and refractory hypoxia despite optimal cardiac output. He was managed with an open-lung ventilation strategy and inhaled nitric oxide for 72 hours until the inflammatory phase resolved.

  presenting_complaint: Nausea, vomiting, and severe pleuritic chest pain followed by hypoxia.
  summary_of_course: A 17-year-old female presented with a 1-week history of gastrointestinal symptoms and progressive respiratory failure. She admitted to frequent use of e-cigarettes containing THC oil. CT showed diffuse ground-glass opacities with subpleural sparing; she met ARDS criteria with a PaO2/FiO2 of 110 mmHg and responded rapidly to systemic methylprednisolone.

  primary_diagnosis: Acute ARDS from chlorine gas inhalation
  presenting_complaint: Immediate choking sensation, wheezing, and eye irritation after a chemical spill.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male industrial worker was exposed to high concentrations of chlorine gas. Initial bronchospasm was treated with bronchodilators, but he developed progressive non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema 12 hours later. He was managed with invasive ventilation and PEEP of 14 cmH2O, with resolution of the ARDS picture within 96 hours.

acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Myalgia, fever, and sudden onset of profound breathlessness.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male farm worker in a rural area presented with a flu-like prodrome followed by rapid respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock. Blood tests showed significant haemoconcentration and thrombocytopenia. He developed severe ARDS with massive pleural effusions and required urgent stabilisation before transfer to a tertiary centre for ECMO evaluation.

acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Malaria-associated ARDS
  presenting_complaint: High fever, jaundice, and new-onset tachypnoea after returning from Nigeria.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female was diagnosed with Plasmodium falciparum malaria with 15% parasitaemia. Despite starting intravenous artesunate, her respiratory status deteriorated on day 2, characterized by a PaO2/FiO2 of 130 mmHg and bilateral infiltrates. This was diagnosed as malaria-associated ARDS, a known complication of heavy parasite burden, requiring 6 days of mechanical ventilation.

acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild unilateral ARDS (Re-expansion Pulmonary Oedema)
  presenting_complaint: Severe cough and shortness of breath immediately following a chest drain insertion.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with a large chronic pleural effusion underwent rapid drainage of 3.5 litres of fluid. Shortly after, he developed ipsilateral pulmonary oedema and hypoxia (PaO2/FiO2 210 mmHg). While technically unilateral, the inflammatory cascade mimicked ARDS physiology and was managed with CPAP and lateral decubitus positioning for 48 hours.

acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Fibrotic phase ARDS (Chronic/Late stage)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent ventilator dependence three weeks after an initial septic insult.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female remained in the ICU 21 days after developing ARDS from faecal peritonitis. While her infection had cleared, her lungs became increasingly non-compliant with "honeycombing" and traction bronchiectasis on CT. This represented the fibrotic phase of ARDS, requiring a tracheostomy and a very slow weaning protocol over several months.

acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Negative Pressure Pulmonary Oedema
  presenting_complaint: Pink frothy sputum and gasping for air in the post-operative recovery room.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old muscular male underwent an elective tonsillectomy and developed severe laryngospasm upon extubation. His forceful inspiratory efforts against a closed glottis generated significant negative intrapleural pressure, leading to immediate alveolar flooding. He met ARDS criteria briefly with severe hypoxia but responded rapidly to PEEP and diuretics, with a normal chest X-ray within 24 hours.
