oesophagitis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild reflux oesophagitis (Los Angeles Grade A)
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent retrosternal heartburn and acid regurgitation.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male presented with a 6-month history of post-prandial burning pain worsened by lying flat. OGD revealed minor mucosal breaks less than 5mm limited to the mucosal folds. Symptoms resolved completely following an 8-week course of daily omeprazole 20mg and weight loss advice.

oesophagitis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE)
  presenting_complaint: Acute food bolus obstruction and long-standing dysphagia.
  summary_of_course: An 18-year-old male with a history of atopic asthma presented to A&E unable to swallow saliva after eating meat. Emergency OGD removed the bolus and identified characteristic "trachealisation" of the oesophagus with multiple concentric rings. Biopsies confirmed >20 eosinophils per high-power field, and the patient was commenced on a six-food elimination diet and swallowed fluticasone.

oesophagitis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Candida oesophagitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe odynophagia and oral thrush.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female with known HIV (non-compliant with HAART) presented with a CD4 count of 85 cells/uL and painful swallowing. OGD showed extensive white adherent plaques throughout the oesophageal mucosa that did not wash off. She was treated with a 14-day course of oral fluconazole, resulting in rapid symptomatic improvement.

oesophagitis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Corrosive oesophagitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe oropharyngeal pain and haematemesis following bleach ingestion.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male was admitted to the ICU following a deliberate ingestion of concentrated alkaline bleach. Early endoscopy revealed circumferential necrosis and deep ulceration (Zargar Grade IIIb) of the mid-to-distal oesophagus. He required parenteral nutrition and subsequently developed a dense oesophageal stricture requiring repeated endoscopic dilatations.

oesophagitis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Pill-induced oesophagitis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset retrosternal chest pain and painful swallowing.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female with osteoporosis presented with acute retrosternal pain that began shortly after taking her weekly alendronate with minimal water before bed. OGD identified a discrete, "punched-out" solitary ulcer in the mid-oesophagus at the level of the aortic arch. She was managed with PPI therapy and instructed on correct medication administration techniques.

oesophagitis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe reflux oesophagitis (Los Angeles Grade D) with Barrett's mucosa
  presenting_complaint: Chronic dyspepsia and iron deficiency anaemia.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with a 20-year history of GORD presented for screening due to persistent symptoms despite OTC antacids. OGD showed confluent circumferential ulceration involving >75% of the circumference and a 4cm segment of suspected Barrett's oesophagus. High-dose twice-daily PPI therapy was initiated, and follow-up biopsies confirmed intestinal metaplasia without dysplasia.

oesophagitis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) oesophagitis
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset odynophagia and retrosternal pain in an immunocompromised patient.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male undergoing chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia developed severe pain on swallowing and fever. OGD revealed multiple small, discrete "volcano-like" ulcers with raised edges in the distal oesophagus. Viral swabs and histology confirmed HSV-1, and he was successfully treated with intravenous acyclovir.

oesophagitis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Radiation oesophagitis
  presenting_complaint: Dysphagia and retrosternal discomfort during lung cancer treatment.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) developed significant swallowing difficulties in the third week of treatment. Clinical assessment suggested acute radiation-induced mucosal injury. She was managed with liquid nutritional supplements, viscous lidocaine, and PPIs, allowing her to complete her oncological treatment.

oesophagitis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic peptic stricture secondary to oesophagitis
  presenting_complaint: Progressive dysphagia to solid foods over 12 months.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with a history of hiatus hernia presented with food sticking in his lower chest. OGD identified a smooth, 12mm diameter narrowing in the distal oesophagus associated with Grade B oesophagitis. The stricture was dilated endoscopically to 15mm, and he was maintained on long-term PPI therapy to prevent recurrence.

oesophagitis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute haemorrhagic oesophagitis (Black Oesophagus)
  presenting_complaint: Coffee-ground vomiting and epigastric pain.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with peripheral vascular disease and malnutrition presented with haematemesis and hypotension. Urgent OGD revealed a striking appearance of circumferential black, necrotic-appearing mucosa in the distal two-thirds of the oesophagus (acute necrotising oesophagitis). He was managed conservatively with aggressive fluid resuscitation, IV PPI infusion, and NPO status, with gradual mucosal healing on repeat endoscopy.

oesophagitis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric gastro-oesophageal reflux oesophagitis
  presenting_complaint: Excessive vomiting, irritability, and poor weight gain in an infant.
  summary_of_course: A 4-month-old infant was referred to paediatrics due to "silent reflux" symptoms and failure to thrive. pH-impedance monitoring confirmed pathological acid exposure, and endoscopy showed distal oesophageal friability. Symptoms improved significantly after thickening feeds and a trial of paediatric-dose ranitidine (historical) or omeprazole.

oesophagitis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory oesophagitis secondary to Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent, severe epigastric pain and persistent oesophageal ulceration.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female failed to respond to standard PPI therapy for Grade C oesophagitis. Further investigations revealed multiple duodenal ulcers and a fasting serum gastrin level of 1200 pg/mL. A somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (Octreoscan) identified a small gastrinoma in the pancreas, explaining the refractory acid-induced oesophageal damage.

oesophagitis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Oesophagitis secondary to Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma)
  presenting_complaint: Severe nocturnal reflux and "food sticking" sensation.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with known scleroderma and Raynaud's phenomenon presented with worsening retrosternal burning. Oesophageal manometry showed absent peristalsis and a hypotensive lower oesophageal sphincter. OGD confirmed Grade C oesophagitis due to the loss of clearance mechanisms, requiring lifelong high-dose PPIs and prokinetics.

oesophagitis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) oesophagitis
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss, odynophagia, and low-grade fever.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male with advanced AIDS presented with progressive inability to eat due to pain. OGD showed several large, shallow, linear ulcerations in the mid-to-distal oesophagus. Biopsies revealed intranuclear "owl’s eye" inclusion bodies characteristic of CMV, and he was treated with intravenous ganciclovir.

oesophagitis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Bile reflux oesophagitis (Alkaline oesophagitis)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent epigastric burning and bilious vomiting post-surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male who previously underwent a Billroth II gastrectomy presented with severe retrosternal pain that did not respond to PPIs. OGD showed significant bile pooling in the stomach remnant and erythematous distal oesophagitis. Biopsies showed reactive changes but no acid-related injury, and he was managed with bile acid sequestrants (sucralfate) and eventual surgical revision to a Roux-en-Y limb.

oesophagitis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Cameron ulcers within a large hiatus hernia
  presenting_complaint: Occult gastrointestinal bleeding and chronic iron deficiency anaemia.
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old female presented with lethargy and a haemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL. OGD identified a large sliding hiatus hernia with linear erosions (Cameron ulcers) located on the mucosal folds where the diaphragm constricted the stomach. She was treated with oral iron supplementation and high-dose PPIs to heal the erosions and prevent further blood loss.

oesophagitis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic oesophagitis with Mallory-Weiss tear
  presenting_complaint: Haematemesis following a period of heavy alcohol consumption.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male with chronic alcohol dependence presented with forceful vomiting followed by bright red blood. OGD showed background Grade B reflux oesophagitis and a 2cm longitudinal mucosal laceration at the gastro-oesophageal junction. The tear was treated with endoscopic clipping, and the patient was started on thiamine and acid suppression.

oesophagitis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Eosinophilic Oesophagitis with stricture
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent vomiting and avoidance of solid textures in a 6-year-old.
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old boy with multiple food allergies was referred for "picky eating" and frequent regurgitation. Barium swallow showed a proximal oesophageal narrowing, and OGD confirmed dense eosinophilic infiltration (>50/hpf) and a narrow-calibre oesophagus. He required a graduated series of balloon dilatations and a strict amino-acid-based elemental diet.

oesophagitis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the oesophagus
  presenting_complaint: New onset dysphagia and retrosternal pain following bone marrow transplant.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male, day 100 post-allogeneic stem cell transplant for leukaemia, developed skin rash and watery diarrhoea followed by dysphagia. OGD showed friable, desquamating mucosa and proximal oesophageal webbing. Biopsies confirmed Grade II GVHD, and symptoms improved after escalating systemic corticosteroid therapy and adding topical budesonide slurry.

oesophagitis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Oesophageal Crohn's disease
  presenting_complaint: Retrosternal pain, weight loss, and recurrent aphthous mouth ulcers.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female with a known history of ileal Crohn's disease presented with new upper GI symptoms. OGD revealed multiple "snail-track" ulcers and cobblestoning in the mid-oesophagus, distinct from the gastro-oesophageal junction. Histology showed non-caseating granulomas, and her biological therapy was switched from adalimumab to infliximab to achieve systemic remission.
