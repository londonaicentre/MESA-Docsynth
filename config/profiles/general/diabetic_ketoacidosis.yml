  presenting_complaint: Dyspnoea and skipped insulin doses.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female on maintenance haemodialysis presented with fluid overload and DKA (pH 7.15, glucose 28 mmol/L). Management was extremely challenging due to the risk of pulmonary oedema with standard IV fluid volumes and severe hyperkalaemia (K+ 7.2 mmol/L). She required urgent bedside filtration to correct the acidosis and electrolyte imbalance.

diabetic_ketoacidosis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Diabetic Ketoacidosis
  presenting_complaint: Vomiting and persistent high ketones despite treatment.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female with T1DM and high insulin resistance was started on standard FRIII (0.1 units/kg/hr). Despite 12 hours of treatment, her ketones remained >5 mmol/L and pH did not improve. The insulin rate was increased to 0.2 units/kg/hr, and she was screened for occult infection, eventually resolving after 36 hours of intensive therapy.
