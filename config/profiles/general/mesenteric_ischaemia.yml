mesenteric_ischaemia_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute embolic mesenteric ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of severe, generalised abdominal pain out of proportion to clinical findings.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and suboptimal anticoagulation presented with excruciating pain and vomiting. Initial examination showed a soft abdomen with minimal tenderness, but serum lactate was 4.2 mmol/L. CT angiography (CTA) confirmed a filling defect in the superior mesenteric artery (SMA); she underwent emergency embolectomy and recovered well with resumed warfarin therapy.

mesenteric_ischaemia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic mesenteric ischaemia (intestinal angina)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent post-prandial epigastric pain and significant weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male smoker presented with a 6-month history of "sitophobia" (fear of eating) due to dull, cramping pain occurring 30 minutes after meals. Clinical examination revealed an epigastric bruit and cachexia. Duplex ultrasound and MRA demonstrated >70% stenosis in both the celiac axis and SMA, requiring elective endovascular stenting.

mesenteric_ischaemia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Non-occlusive mesenteric ischaemia (NOMI)
  presenting_complaint: Increasing abdominal distension and rising vasopressor requirements in the ICU.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old patient in septic shock secondary to pneumonia developed sudden metabolic acidosis and ileus. Despite stable macro-haemodynamics on noradrenaline, CTA showed diffuse narrowing of mesenteric vessels without a focal thrombus. Treatment involved optimising cardiac output and reducing vasopressors, but the patient developed transmural necrosis and died.

mesenteric_ischaemia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT)
  presenting_complaint: Subacute onset of vague central abdominal pain and nausea over five days.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male with undiagnosed Factor V Leiden mutation presented with worsening colicky pain. CT with oral and IV contrast revealed thrombus in the superior mesenteric vein with bowel wall thickening and "misty" mesentery. He was managed successfully with systemic anticoagulation and bowel rest without the need for surgical resection.

mesenteric_ischaemia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic mesenteric ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Sudden intensification of chronic abdominal pain and new-onset haematochezia.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old woman with known peripheral vascular disease and previous stable claudication-type abdominal pain presented in extremis. Investigations showed acute thrombosis overlying a long-standing atherosclerotic plaque at the SMA origin. Despite emergency laparotomy and bypass, extensive small bowel infarction was found, and the patient was transitioned to palliative care.

mesenteric_ischaemia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Ischaemic colitis
  presenting_complaint: Left-sided abdominal pain followed by self-limiting bloody diarrhoea.
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old male presented to the A&E with acute cramping in the left iliac fossa. Colonoscopy performed within 48 hours showed friable, oedematous mucosa in the splenic flexure and descending colon, sparing the rectum. The condition was managed conservatively with IV fluids and antibiotics, with full resolution of symptoms within a week.

mesenteric_ischaemia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Midgut volvulus with mesenteric ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Acute bilious vomiting and irritability in a neonate.
  summary_of_course: A 10-day-old infant presented with sudden clinical deterioration and a distended, tender abdomen. An upper GI contrast study suggested malrotation, and emergency laparotomy confirmed a 360-degree midgut volvulus causing venous and arterial compromise. Following detorsion and a Ladd's procedure, the bowel regained perfusion, and the patient survived with minimal resection.

mesenteric_ischaemia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Cocaine-induced mesenteric ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Intense periumbilical pain and vomiting following recreational drug use.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male presented with acute abdominal pain shortly after inhaling cocaine. CTA showed segmental vasoconstriction of the mesenteric arcade with no evidence of atherosclerosis or embolus. His symptoms resolved over 24 hours with aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasodilators, avoiding surgical intervention.

mesenteric_ischaemia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic epigastric pain exacerbated by expiration and eating.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female with a long history of unexplained weight loss and post-prandial pain underwent multiple normal endoscopies. CTA in both inspiratory and expiratory phases revealed extrinsic compression of the celiac artery by the median arcuate ligament. She underwent a successful laparoscopic ligament release, resulting in complete symptom relief.

mesenteric_ischaemia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Focal segmental mesenteric ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Localised right-sided abdominal pain and guarding.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old woman presented with symptoms mimicking acute appendicitis. Laparotomy revealed a focal 10cm segment of ischaemic ileum caused by a restrictive mesenteric band from previous surgery. The affected segment was resected with a primary anastomosis, and she made an uncomplicated recovery.

mesenteric_ischaemia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Mesenteric ischaemia secondary to aortic dissection
  presenting_complaint: Tearing chest pain radiating to the back followed by acute abdominal pain.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with a Type B aortic dissection developed sudden abdominal distension and anuria. The dissection flap was found to be occluding the origins of the SMA and renal arteries. Urgent endovascular fenestration and stenting were performed to restore mesenteric perfusion, preventing bowel necrosis.

mesenteric_ischaemia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-operative ischaemic colitis
  presenting_complaint: Bloody diarrhoea and rising inflammatory markers three days after AAA repair.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male underwent elective open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. Post-operatively, he developed metabolic acidosis and passing of "currant jelly" stools. Flexible sigmoidoscopy confirmed ischaemia of the sigmoid colon due to ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery in the presence of poor collateral flow, requiring a Hartmann's procedure.

mesenteric_ischaemia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Mesenteric ischaemia in Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN)
  presenting_complaint: Fever, weight loss, and diffuse abdominal pain.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with known systemic vasculitis presented with worsening mesenteric symptoms. Angiography showed multiple small aneurysms and "beading" of the mesenteric arteries characteristic of PAN. Despite high-dose corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, he developed a perforated ileal segment necessitating emergency resection.

mesenteric_ischaemia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute SMA thrombosis in a healthy adult
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, severe central abdominal pain and shock.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old previously fit female presented with acute mesenteric ischaemia. CTA showed a fresh thrombus at the origin of the SMA, and subsequent workup revealed an occult malignancy-associated hypercoagulable state. She underwent emergency thrombectomy and commenced long-term anticoagulation.

mesenteric_ischaemia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Exercise-induced mesenteric ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal cramps and haematochezia during a marathon.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old athlete presented to the medical tent with acute onset of severe pain and rectal bleeding. The presentation was attributed to splanchnic vasoconstriction and "blood shunting" away from the gut during extreme exertion. He was managed with rapid rehydration and monitoring, with symptoms resolving fully within 12 hours.

mesenteric_ischaemia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute mesenteric venous thrombosis with portal hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Increasing ascites and vague abdominal discomfort in a cirrhotic patient.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with Child-Pugh B cirrhosis presented with a sudden increase in girth and dull pain. Imaging revealed an extension of a portal vein thrombus into the superior mesenteric vein. He was treated with low-molecular-weight heparin and TIPS (Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt) to reduce venous congestion.

mesenteric_ischaemia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Mesenteric ischaemia due to strangulated internal hernia
  presenting_complaint: Classic signs of small bowel obstruction and late-stage peritonitis.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old woman with no prior surgery presented with vomiting and absolute constipation. CT demonstrated a transmesenteric internal hernia with twisting of the mesenteric pedicle. At surgery, 2 metres of gangrenous small bowel were resected, and she subsequently required long-term parenteral nutrition for short bowel syndrome.

mesenteric_ischaemia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic mesenteric ischaemia with treatment failure
  presenting_complaint: Recurrence of post-prandial pain three months after SMA stenting.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old female with extensive atherosclerosis underwent SMA stenting for intestinal angina. Her symptoms returned, and follow-up imaging confirmed in-stent restenosis and occlusion. She subsequently underwent a retrograde mesenteric bypass (ROBMS) which successfully restored long-term perfusion.

mesenteric_ischaemia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute mesenteric ischaemia (Non-diagnostic CT)
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal pain with a "normal" initial CT scan.
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old man presented with classic "pain out of proportion." An initial CT report was negative for acute pathology, but persistent lactic acidosis prompted a specialist radiology review which identified a subtle lack of bowel wall enhancement. He was taken to theatre where early ischaemic changes were noted, and a successful revascularisation was performed.

mesenteric_ischaemia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Transmural mesenteric infarction (Life-threatening)
  presenting_complaint: Comatose state with a rigid, silent abdomen and profound shock.
  summary_of_course: A 92-year-old resident of a nursing home was found unresponsive with a distended abdomen. Bedside ultrasound showed free fluid, and a VBG revealed a pH of 6.9 and lactate of 18 mmol/L. Given her age, comorbidities, and the extent of likely necrosis, a multidisciplinary decision was made for end-of-life care.
