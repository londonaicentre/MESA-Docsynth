kaposi_sarcoma_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Classic Kaposi Sarcoma
  presenting_complaint: Persistent purple plaques on the lower limbs and ankles.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male of Mediterranean descent presented with a 2-year history of slow-growing, non-pruritic violaceous plaques on his bilateral lower shins. Skin biopsy confirmed HHV-8 positive Kaposi Sarcoma with a spindle cell infiltrate. Given the indolent nature and patient age, he was managed conservatively with compression hosiery and localized radiotherapy for the most symptomatic lesions, showing excellent partial response.

kaposi_sarcoma_002:
  primary_diagnosis: AIDS-associated Epidemic Kaposi Sarcoma
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressing skin nodules and oral lesions.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male, recently diagnosed with HIV (CD4 count 85 cells/uL), presented with disseminated cutaneous nodules and a painful purple lesion on the hard palate. Biopsy of a truncal lesion confirmed KS, and staging CT revealed lymphadenopathy. He was commenced on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and systemic liposomal doxorubicin, resulting in significant regression of lesions over six cycles.

kaposi_sarcoma_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic (Transplant-related) Kaposi Sarcoma
  presenting_complaint: New onset of reddish-brown skin lesions six months post-renal transplant.
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old male on tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil for a renal graft developed multiple cutaneous nodules on his upper torso. Biopsy confirmed KS; screening for visceral involvement was negative. His immunosuppression was modified by switching tacrolimus to sirolimus (an mTOR inhibitor), which led to complete clinical regression of the lesions within four months.

kaposi_sarcoma_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Endemic (African) Lymphadenopathic Kaposi Sarcoma
  presenting_complaint: Massive cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy with fever.
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old boy from Uganda presented with rapid-onset, bulky lymphadenopathy and weight loss, initially suspected to be lymphoma. Lymph node biopsy revealed characteristic slit-like vascular spaces and spindle cells positive for HHV-8, confirming endemic KS. Despite aggressive chemotherapy with vincristine and bleomycin, the disease followed a fulminant course with poor outcome.

kaposi_sarcoma_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Pulmonary Kaposi Sarcoma
  presenting_complaint: Progressive dyspnoea, dry cough, and occasional haemoptysis.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old HIV-positive male with known cutaneous KS presented with acute respiratory distress. High-resolution CT showed bilateral peribronchovascular thickening and nodular opacities, while bronchoscopy revealed characteristic "flame-shaped" haemorrhagic endobronchial lesions. He was admitted to the ICU for oxygen support and treated with urgent systemic chemotherapy and HAART.

kaposi_sarcoma_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Gastrointestinal Kaposi Sarcoma
  presenting_complaint: Iron deficiency anaemia and melaena.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with a history of classic KS presented with symptomatic anaemia and positive faecal occult blood. Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) identified multiple raised, haemorrhagic submucosal nodules in the gastric fundus and duodenum. Histopathology confirmed GI involvement of KS, necessitating iron supplementation and localized endoscopic therapy for bleeding control.

kaposi_sarcoma_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Inflammatory Kaposi Sarcoma
  presenting_complaint: Painful, erythematous swelling of the left leg mimicking cellulitis.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male presented with a hot, swollen, and tender lower limb that failed to respond to multiple courses of intravenous flucloxacillin. Subsequent skin biopsy of an inconspicuous violaceous patch within the oedematous area confirmed KS with significant associated lymphoedema. Management shifted to radiotherapy and decongestive lymphatic therapy, which resolved the inflammatory symptoms.

kaposi_sarcoma_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Kaposi Sarcoma Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (KS-IRIS)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden flare and ulceration of existing skin lesions after starting ART.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male with AIDS-KS experienced a dramatic increase in the size and number of his skin lesions three weeks after initiating HAART, coinciding with a rise in CD4 count and drop in viral load. The lesions became highly oedematous and painful, consistent with KS-IRIS. He required a temporary course of oral prednisolone alongside continued HAART and chemotherapy to manage the inflammatory flare.

kaposi_sarcoma_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Disseminated Kaposi Sarcoma with Pleural Effusion
  presenting_complaint: Severe shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old HIV-positive patient presented with a large unilateral pleural effusion. Pleural fluid analysis showed an exudate with high HHV-8 DNA titres by PCR, and CT imaging demonstrated nodular pleural thickening. Despite drainage and systemic chemotherapy, the patient’s condition remained guarded due to extensive visceral burden and low functional status.

kaposi_sarcoma_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Ocular Kaposi Sarcoma
  presenting_complaint: Bright red growth on the conjunctiva of the right eye.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male presented to ophthalmology with a painless, vascular mass in the inferior fornix of the conjunctiva. Initially mistaken for a subconjunctival haemorrhage, the persistence of the lesion led to an excisional biopsy confirming KS. Further investigation revealed undiagnosed HIV infection, and the patient was commenced on HAART with no recurrence of the ocular lesion.

kaposi_sarcoma_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory AIDS-related Kaposi Sarcoma
  presenting_complaint: Persistent and enlarging skin lesions despite multiple lines of therapy.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male with long-standing HIV and KS showed disease progression after initial success with liposomal doxorubicin and second-line paclitaxel. His CD4 count remained suppressed despite virological control on HAART. He was enrolled in a clinical trial for pomalidomide, which resulted in a partial response and stabilization of his cutaneous disease.

kaposi_sarcoma_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Classic Kaposi Sarcoma with Bone Involvement
  presenting_complaint: Chronic deep-seated pain in the right foot and purple skin nodules.
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old male with known classic KS presented with worsening foot pain and inability to bear weight. Plain radiographs and MRI showed osteolytic lesions in the metatarsals underlying a large KS plaque. Biopsy confirmed intraosseous extension of the sarcoma, and he was treated with palliative radiotherapy to the foot to improve mobility and reduce pain.

kaposi_sarcoma_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Penile Kaposi Sarcoma
  presenting_complaint: Painful purple nodule on the glans penis and urinary hesitancy.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male presented with a solitary, firm, violaceous nodule on the glans penis that caused discomfort during micturition. Biopsy confirmed KS, and subsequent screening revealed the patient was HIV-positive. The lesion regressed significantly after six months of HAART, avoiding the need for more invasive surgical intervention or local radiotherapy.

kaposi_sarcoma_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Kaposi Sarcoma in a Non-HIV Immunocompromised Patient
  presenting_complaint: Multiple violaceous papules on the trunk and arms.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) on long-term ibrutinib therapy developed widespread cutaneous KS. HIV testing was negative, and she had no Mediterranean ancestry. The presentation was attributed to T-cell dysfunction secondary to her underlying malignancy and its treatment; the KS was managed with localized cryotherapy and monitoring of her haematological status.

kaposi_sarcoma_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Laryngeal Kaposi Sarcoma
  presenting_complaint: Progressive hoarseness and inspiratory stridor.
  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old male with advanced AIDS presented to the emergency department with acute airway compromise. Laryngoscopy revealed a bulky, friable, purple mass obstructing the supraglottis. Following an emergency tracheostomy to secure the airway, biopsy confirmed KS, and the patient was treated with urgent systemic chemotherapy and HAART.

kaposi_sarcoma_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Endemic Kaposi Sarcoma (Florid Variant)
  presenting_complaint: Large, fungating, and malodorous masses on the lower legs.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male from Malawi presented with aggressive, exophytic, and ulcerated masses on both feet, interfering with walking. This florid endemic variant showed deep tissue invasion on imaging. Treatment involved a combination of systemic chemotherapy (etoposide) and wound care, but the patient required a below-knee amputation due to secondary bacterial sepsis and extensive tissue destruction.

kaposi_sarcoma_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Gastrointestinal Haemorrhage from KS
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset haematemesis and hypovolaemic shock.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male with known disseminated AIDS-KS was admitted via A&E with profuse upper GI bleeding. Emergency endoscopy identified a bleeding gastric KS lesion, which was treated with adrenaline injection and haemostatic clipping. He received blood transfusions and was subsequently stabilized with an intensified chemotherapy regimen.

kaposi_sarcoma_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Early-stage Classic Kaposi Sarcoma
  presenting_complaint: Small, asymptomatic purple macule on the sole of the foot.
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old male of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage noted a 5mm flat purple lesion on his right sole during a routine diabetic foot check. Biopsy showed early "patch stage" Kaposi Sarcoma. Given the solitary, asymptomatic nature of the lesion, a "watch and wait" strategy was adopted with 6-monthly dermatological reviews.

kaposi_sarcoma_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Kaposi Sarcoma with Severe Lymphoedema
  presenting_complaint: Massive, "elephantiasis-like" swelling of the lower limbs.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with chronic KS presented with severe bilateral leg swelling that limited his mobility. The lymphoedema was disproportionate to the number of skin lesions, caused by KS-associated lymphatic obstruction. Management was challenging, requiring a combination of systemic chemotherapy to shrink the tumours and intensive specialist physiotherapy for lymphoedema management.

kaposi_sarcoma_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Oral Kaposi Sarcoma with Secondary Infection
  presenting_complaint: Painful, bleeding palatal mass and difficulty eating.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old HIV-positive male presented with a large, ulcerated KS lesion on the hard palate that had become secondarily infected with Candida and oral flora. He was unable to maintain oral intake due to pain. Treatment involved intravenous fluconazole and antibiotics, followed by liquid-based nutritional support and initiation of HAART and liposomal doxorubicin to reduce the tumour bulk.
