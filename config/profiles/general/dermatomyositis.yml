dermatomyositis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Classic adult dermatomyositis
  presenting_complaint: Symmetrical proximal muscle weakness and a purple rash on the eyelids.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old woman presented with subacute difficulty climbing stairs and a heliotrope rash. Investigations revealed a CK of 4500 U/L and positive anti-Mi-2 antibodies; muscle biopsy confirmed inflammatory myopathy. She responded well to high-dose oral prednisolone and methotrexate, achieving remission within six months.

dermatomyositis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM)
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty walking, skin rashes, and hard lumps under the skin.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy presented with Gowers' sign, Gottron papules, and extensive calcinosis over the elbows. MRI showed widespread muscle oedema, and he was started on IV methylprednisolone followed by subcutaneous methotrexate. Despite initial improvement, calcinosis remained a significant cause of morbidity, requiring adjuvant treatment with bisphosphonates.

dermatomyositis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis (CADM)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent red rash on the knuckles and chest with no muscle weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old woman presented with a "V-sign" rash and Gottron papules but maintained full power on clinical testing. CK levels were normal, but skin biopsy was consistent with dermatomyositis. Screening for internal involvement was negative, and she was managed with topical steroids and hydroxychloroquine in an outpatient setting.

dermatomyositis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Paraneoplastic dermatomyositis
  presenting_complaint: Rapid onset of severe muscle weakness and weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male smoker presented with acute proximal weakness and a heliotrope rash. Given his age and 15kg weight loss, a CT thorax/abdomen/pelvis was performed, revealing a suspicious lung mass. Biopsy confirmed small cell lung carcinoma, and his dermatomyositis was managed as a paraneoplastic phenomenon alongside chemotherapy.

dermatomyositis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Anti-MDA5 positive dermatomyositis with RP-ILD
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive breathlessness and painful skin ulcers on the fingers.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old woman presented with minimal muscle weakness but severe respiratory distress and digital ulceration. High-resolution CT showed rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease (RP-ILD), and serology was positive for anti-MDA5 antibodies. Despite aggressive treatment in the ICU with cyclophosphamide and rituximab, her respiratory failure progressed, necessitating mechanical ventilation.

dermatomyositis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Anti-synthetase syndrome (Dermatomyositis overlap)
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath, cracked skin on fingertips, and joint pain.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old man presented with "mechanic's hands," Raynaud's phenomenon, and exertional dyspnoea. Testing showed anti-Jo-1 antibodies and evidence of both dermatomyositis-type skin changes and interstitial lung disease on HRCT. He was commenced on mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone, showing a gradual stabilisation of his lung function.

dermatomyositis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic refractory dermatomyositis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent flares of muscle weakness despite multiple immunosuppressants.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old woman with a 5-year history of dermatomyositis failed to maintain remission on azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate. She presented with a chronic-on-acute flare of proximal weakness and elevated CK. She was subsequently transitioned to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy, which finally resulted in sustained clinical improvement.

dermatomyositis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe dermatomyositis with oropharyngeal dysphagia
  presenting_complaint: Inability to swallow and profound weakness of the neck muscles.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old woman was admitted urgently with aspiration pneumonia and an inability to manage secretions. Videofluoroscopy confirmed severe oropharyngeal dysphagia secondary to dermatomyositis-related muscle inflammation. She required a nasogastric tube for nutrition and intensive IV steroid therapy to regain swallowing function.

dermatomyositis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild dermatomyositis
  presenting_complaint: Subtle rash on the hands and mild fatigue.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old woman presented to her GP with faint Gottron papules and fatigue but no objective weakness. CK was mildly elevated at 400 U/L, and EMG showed subtle myopathic changes. She was managed successfully in the community with low-dose prednisolone and sun protection, with no progression to severe disease.

dermatomyositis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Juvenile dermatomyositis with cutaneous ulceration
  presenting_complaint: Deep, painful sores on the knees and elbows.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old girl with known JDM developed necrotic skin ulcers, often associated with anti-NXP2 antibodies. The ulcers became secondarily infected, requiring IV antibiotics and an escalation of immunosuppression to include ciclosporin. Her skin eventually healed with significant scarring, though muscle power remained stable.

dermatomyositis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Dermatomyositis in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: New onset of muscle weakness and rash during the second trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old pregnant woman developed classic dermatomyositis features at 20 weeks gestation. Management was challenging due to pregnancy, but she was safely treated with prednisolone and azathioprine. She was monitored closely by a multidisciplinary team and delivered a healthy infant at term, though her DM flared postpartum.

dermatomyositis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Dermatomyositis with cardiac involvement
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations, chest discomfort, and leg weakness.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old man presented with proximal myopathy and new-onset atrial fibrillation. Cardiac MRI showed late gadolinium enhancement consistent with myocarditis, and CK-MB was disproportionately elevated. He was treated with steroids and cautious uptitration of heart failure medications, showing improvement in both cardiac and skeletal muscle function.

dermatomyositis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Dermatomyositis-Scleroderma overlap syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Tight skin on the face and hands combined with muscle weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old woman presented with features of both systemic sclerosis (sclerodactyly, Raynaud's) and dermatomyositis (Gottron papules, proximal weakness). Serology was positive for anti-PM/Scl antibodies. Treatment required a balanced approach to manage both the fibrotic and inflammatory components, using mycophenolate mofetil.

dermatomyositis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic dermatomyositis flare
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of weakness after a viral upper respiratory tract infection.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male, previously stable on mycophenolate, presented with a rapid decline in mobility and rising CK levels following a flu-like illness. He was admitted for IV methylprednisolone pulses. His symptoms resolved back to baseline over three weeks, and his maintenance dose of immunosuppression was adjusted.

dermatomyositis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Statin-triggered dermatomyositis
  presenting_complaint: Severe muscle pain and rash after starting atorvastatin.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old woman developed a heliotrope rash and severe myalgia shortly after commencing statin therapy. While initially suspected to be simple statin myopathy, the presence of a classic rash and anti-HMGCR antibodies suggested a triggered autoimmune dermatomyositis. Statin cessation and steroid therapy were required to control the inflammatory process.

dermatomyositis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Dermatomyositis with malignancy (Ovarian Cancer)
  presenting_complaint: Pelvic pain and classic dermatomyositis rash.
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old woman presented with a heliotrope rash and proximal weakness. During the diagnostic workup, an adnexal mass was discovered on ultrasound, and CA-125 was significantly elevated. Surgery for ovarian carcinoma led to a dramatic improvement in her dermatomyositis symptoms, though she required short-term steroids.

dermatomyositis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Dermatomyositis in a patient with HIV
  presenting_complaint: Proximal weakness and rash in the context of known HIV infection.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old HIV-positive man on ART presented with a CK of 3000 U/L and Gottron papules. The diagnostic challenge was distinguishing DM from HIV-associated myopathy or ART-related toxicity. Muscle biopsy confirmed the characteristic perifascicular atrophy of dermatomyositis, and he was successfully treated with steroids without compromising his viral load.

dermatomyositis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-viral juvenile dermatomyositis
  presenting_complaint: Rapid onset of rash and weakness following glandular fever.
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old boy developed a classic dermatomyositis presentation six weeks after a confirmed Epstein-Barr virus infection. He presented with severe fatigue, malar rash, and proximal weakness. He responded exceptionally well to a course of IVIG and oral steroids, achieving a full recovery within a year.

dermatomyositis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Dermatomyositis with necrotising features
  presenting_complaint: Extremely painful muscle weakness and high fever.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old woman presented with an acute, severe illness mimicking necrotising autoimmune myopathy but with distinct heliotrope features. Muscle biopsy showed significant myofibre necrosis alongside perivascular inflammation. She required triple therapy with steroids, methotrexate, and rituximab to control the aggressive inflammatory process.

dermatomyositis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic dermatomyositis (Biopsy proven)
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of elevated CK and a mild facial rash.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old man was referred after a routine health check showed a CK of 1200 U/L. He had a faint rash on his eyelids which he had attributed to hay fever. Skin and muscle biopsies confirmed dermatomyositis despite his lack of functional impairment, and he was started on hydroxychloroquine for monitoring and early intervention.
