primary_cancer_colorectal_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Locally advanced rectal cancer
  presenting_complaint: Pelvic pain and urinary frequency
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old frail male with multiple comorbidities presented with chronic pelvic pain. MRI showed a T4b rectal tumour invading the bladder and prostate, deemed unresectable for cure. He was managed palliatively with a diverting colostomy to prevent obstruction and radiotherapy for pain control.

primary_cancer_colorectal_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Adenocarcinoma of the appendix
  presenting_complaint: Acute right iliac fossa pain
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male underwent an emergency appendicectomy for suspected acute appendicitis. Histopathology unexpectedly revealed a 1.5cm primary adenocarcinoma at the base of the appendix. He subsequently underwent a formal right hemicolectomy to ensure adequate lymphadenectomy and oncological clearance.

primary_cancer_colorectal_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent colorectal cancer
  presenting_complaint: Rising Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) levels
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male, three years post-anterior resection for Dukes B cancer, showed a serial rise in CEA during routine follow-up. A PET-CT scan identified a 2cm recurrence at the anastomotic site without distant spread. He was referred for salvage surgery and intraoperative radiotherapy.

  primary_diagnosis: Transverse colon cancer with systemic symptoms
  presenting_complaint: Night sweats, anorexia, and profound weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male presented with significant constitutional symptoms and a palpable mid-abdominal mass.

  primary_diagnosis: Incidental splenic flexure cancer
  presenting_complaint: Flank pain (investigated for renal calculi)
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female underwent a non-contrast CT KUB for suspected renal colic. While no stones were found, the radiologist noted eccentric thickening of the splenic flexure. Colonoscopy and biopsy confirmed an early-stage primary adenocarcinoma, which was treated with a laparoscopic left hemicolectomy.

primary_cancer_colorectal_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Pregnancy-associated rectal cancer
  presenting_complaint: Rectal bleeding in the third trimester
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female, 28 weeks pregnant, presented with persistent PR bleeding. Initial assessment for haemorrhoids was negative, and a flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed a mid-rectal mass. Following multidisciplinary discussion, she underwent a planned Caesarean section at 32 weeks followed by staging MRI and radical surgery.

primary_cancer_colorectal_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Sigmoid cancer with colovesical fistula
  presenting_complaint: Pneumaturia and recurrent urinary tract infections
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old female presented with "bubbles in the urine" and foul-smelling discharge. Investigations, including a cystoscopy and CT with oral contrast, confirmed a colovesical fistula secondary to a sigmoid adenocarcinoma. She underwent an en-bloc resection of the sigmoid colon and a partial cystectomy.

primary_cancer_colorectal_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Neutropenic sepsis secondary to CRC chemotherapy
  presenting_complaint: Fever and rigors while on CAPOX regimen
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with Stage III colorectal cancer presented to the emergency department ten days after his second cycle of chemotherapy. He was tachycardic and febrile (39.2°C) with a neutrophil count of 0.2 x 10^9/L. He was treated with IV piperacillin/tazobactam and G-CSF according to the neutropenic sepsis protocol.

primary_cancer_colorectal_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Caecal cancer in a high-risk surgical candidate
  presenting_complaint: Chronic occult GI bleeding and heart failure exacerbation
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with severe COPD and NYHA Class III heart failure presented with symptomatic anaemia. Investigations confirmed a caecal adenocarcinoma, but his ASA grade was 4. After extensive counselling regarding the high perioperative risk, he underwent a palliative-intent right hemicolectomy to stop chronic haemorrhage.

primary_cancer_colorectal_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Early-onset left-sided colon cancer
  presenting_complaint: Change in bowel habit and "pencil-thin" stools
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male with no significant past medical history or family history of cancer presented with a three-month history of narrowing stools. Colonoscopy revealed a near-obstructing mass in the descending colon. Molecular profiling showed the tumour to be microsatellite stable (MSS), and he underwent a left hemicolectomy.

primary_cancer_colorectal_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Metastatic sigmoid cancer with colonic stenting
  presenting_complaint: Subacute large bowel obstruction
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old female with known metastatic lung disease and a new diagnosis of sigmoid cancer presented with abdominal cramping and distension. Given her poor prognosis and advanced stage, a self-expanding metal stent (SEMS) was inserted endoscopically to relieve the obstruction. This provided symptomatic relief and avoided the need for a palliative stoma.
