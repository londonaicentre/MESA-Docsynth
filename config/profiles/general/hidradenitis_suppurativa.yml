hidradenitis_suppurativa_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild axillary hidradenitis suppurativa (Hurley Stage I)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent painful lumps in both armpits for 6 months.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female smoker with a BMI of 32 presented to her GP with intermittent, tender inflammatory nodules in the axillae. There was no evidence of sinus tracts or scarring on examination. She was diagnosed with Hurley Stage I HS and commenced on topical clindamycin 1% lotion and advised on smoking cessation, resulting in a reduction in flare frequency.

hidradenitis_suppurativa_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe perineal hidradenitis suppurativa (Hurley Stage III)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic discharging wounds and severe pain in the groin and buttocks.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male with a 10-year history of HS presented with extensive interconnected sinus tracts and hypertrophic scarring across the entire perineum. Previous trials of lymecycline and rifampicin/clindamycin combination therapy had failed to control the disease. He was started on Adalimumab (biologic therapy) following a high DLQI score and significant clinical severity, showing a 50% reduction in inflammatory lesion count at 12 weeks.

hidradenitis_suppurativa_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric hidradenitis suppurativa
  presenting_complaint: Painful red bumps in the groin area.
  summary_of_course: A 9-year-old girl presented with prepubertal onset of inflammatory nodules in the inguinal folds. Blood tests showed slightly elevated DHEAS levels but were otherwise unremarkable; she was diagnosed with early-onset HS. Management involved gentle antiseptic washes and topical resorcinol 15% cream, with close monitoring by paediatric dermatology.

hidradenitis_suppurativa_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic hidradenitis suppurativa with secondary infection
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of axillary pain, swelling, and fever.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male with known HS presented to A&E with a large, fluctuant, exquisitely tender abscess in the left axilla and a temperature of 38.5°C. Investigations revealed a CRP of 88 mg/L and leucocytosis. He underwent incision and drainage of the acute abscess and was treated with IV flucloxacillin for secondary cellulitis before returning to his maintenance HS regimen.

hidradenitis_suppurativa_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Squamous cell carcinoma complicating hidradenitis suppurativa
  presenting_complaint: Non-healing, bleeding ulcer within a long-standing HS scar on the buttock.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with a 30-year history of Hurley Stage III HS noted a change in a chronic gluteal sinus tract, which became an exophytic, friable mass. An urgent punch biopsy confirmed well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma arising within the chronic inflammatory field. He was referred to the oncology MDT for wide local excision and potential radiotherapy.

hidradenitis_suppurativa_006:
  primary_diagnosis: PASH syndrome (Pyoderma gangrenosum, Acne, and Suppurative Hidradenitis)
  presenting_complaint: Severe acne, painful skin ulcers, and recurrent groin abscesses.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female presented with a complex triad of cystic acne, classic pyoderma gangrenosum ulcers on her pretibial shins, and Hurley Stage II HS. Genetic testing for PSTPIP1 mutations was negative, confirming a PASH phenotype rather than PAPA syndrome. She required a multidisciplinary approach involving high-dose corticosteroids and Infliximab to achieve systemic control.

hidradenitis_suppurativa_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Hidradenitis suppurativa associated with Crohn's disease
  presenting_complaint: Perianal discharge and abdominal pain.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male with known ileocolonic Crohn's disease developed painful suppurative nodules in his axillae and inguinal regions. Pelvic MRI confirmed both perianal fistulising Crohn's and subcutaneous tracks consistent with HS. Management was optimised by choosing Infliximab, which effectively targeted both his inflammatory bowel disease and his cutaneous HS.

hidradenitis_suppurativa_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Late-onset hidradenitis suppurativa
  presenting_complaint: New onset of painful nodules under the breasts.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old post-menopausal female presented with her first episode of inflammatory nodules in the inframammary folds. Although HS typically presents in younger adults, clinical examination confirmed Hurley Stage I disease. She was successfully managed with weight loss advice and intermittent courses of topical fusidic acid.

hidradenitis_suppurativa_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Biologic-refractory hidradenitis suppurativa
  presenting_complaint: Persistent drainage and nodules despite Adalimumab treatment.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female with Hurley Stage III HS failed to show adequate response to 24 weeks of weekly Adalimumab injections. Her HiSCR (Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response) was not achieved, and pain scores remained high. She was subsequently switched to Secukinumab as part of a clinical trial, which led to a gradual reduction in the number of active inflammatory lesions.

hidradenitis_suppurativa_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Septic shock secondary to infected hidradenitis suppurativa
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, rigors, and severe pain from extensive skin lesions.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with neglected, extensive Hurley Stage III HS was brought to the ICU with hypotension (BP 85/50 mmHg) and multi-organ dysfunction. Blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus, and CT imaging showed deep soft tissue gas suggestive of necrotising infection. Following aggressive fluid resuscitation and IV meropenem, he underwent emergency radical debridement of the affected gluteal and perineal tissues.

hidradenitis_suppurativa_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate inframammary hidradenitis suppurativa (Hurley Stage II)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent tracks and scarring under both breasts.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female with a BMI of 38 presented with chronic sinus tracts and occasional abscess formation in the inframammary folds. She had failed multiple courses of erythromycin. Treatment with a 12-week course of oral Rifampicin and Clindamycin (300mg bd each) resulted in significant flattening of the tracts and cessation of discharge.

hidradenitis_suppurativa_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Hidradenitis suppurativa with significant functional impairment
  presenting_complaint: Inability to lift arms due to axillary scarring and pain.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male manual labourer presented with bilateral axillary HS that had caused cicatricial contractures, severely limiting his range of motion. He was unable to work due to the physical restriction and constant malodorous drainage. After stabilising the inflammation with Dapsone, he underwent bilateral wide local excision with split-thickness skin grafting to restore function.

hidradenitis_suppurativa_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Hidradenitis suppurativa with severe psychosocial distress
  presenting_complaint: Social isolation and low mood related to skin condition odour.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female with Hurley Stage II disease presented with signs of major depressive disorder, citing the "foul smell" of her groin lesions as the cause of her social withdrawal. Her DLQI score was 28/30. Alongside dermatological management with oral tetracyclines, she was referred for cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and started on Sertraline, which improved her quality of life.

hidradenitis_suppurativa_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Follicular occlusion tetrad
  presenting_complaint: Scalp crusting, severe acne, and groin abscesses.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male presented with a combination of HS in the axillae, acne conglobata on the back, dissecting cellulitis of the scalp, and a pilonidal sinus. This rare "tetrad" was managed with a prolonged course of high-dose oral Isotretinoin (0.5mg/kg/day). While the acne responded well, the HS required adjunctive intralesional triamcinolone injections for persistent nodules.

hidradenitis_suppurativa_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Misdiagnosed hidradenitis suppurativa (Diagnostic challenge)
  presenting_complaint: Ten-year history of "recurrent boils" treated with repeated short-course antibiotics.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male had been seen multiple times in primary care for "recurrent furunculosis" in the groin, always treated with 1 week of flucloxacillin. On specialist review, the presence of "tombstone" double-headed comedones and bridged scarring confirmed a diagnosis of HS. He was started on a long-term preventative dose of Lymecycline, which significantly reduced the frequency of new lesions.

hidradenitis_suppurativa_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-surgical recurrence of hidradenitis suppurativa
  presenting_complaint: New nodules appearing at the edge of a previous surgical scar.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old female who had undergone wide local excision of the right axilla two years prior presented with new inflammatory lesions at the margins of the graft. This highlighted the "edge effect" where HS recurs in adjacent non-excised skin. She was managed with localized CO2 laser ablation and resumed maintenance topical therapy.

hidradenitis_suppurativa_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Pregnancy-associated flare of hidradenitis suppurativa
  presenting_complaint: Worsening groin pain and nodules during the second trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old female, 20 weeks pregnant, experienced a significant flare of her previously stable HS. Given the pregnancy, tetracyclines and biologics were avoided; she was managed with oral Erythromycin and local antiseptic washes (Hibiscrub). Her symptoms partially improved, and a plan for postpartum escalation of therapy was documented.

hidradenitis_suppurativa_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic anaemia of chronic disease in severe HS
  presenting_complaint: Extreme fatigue and worsening skin drainage.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male with extensive, long-standing Hurley Stage III HS involving the neck, axillae, and torso presented with lethargy. Bloods showed a haemoglobin of 92 g/L, low serum iron, and a very high ferritin (850 ng/mL), consistent with anaemia of chronic disease. Treatment focused on aggressive control of the HS inflammation with Infliximab, which subsequently led to the normalization of his haemoglobin levels.

hidradenitis_suppurativa_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Hidradenitis suppurativa with metabolic syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Painful skin lumps associated with PCOS symptoms.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), hirsutism, and obesity presented with Hurley Stage II HS. Blood tests revealed insulin resistance (HBA1c 44 mmol/mol). In addition to standard HS care, she was started on Metformin and spironolactone, which helped regulate her hormonal profile and led to a marked improvement in her skin stability.

hidradenitis_suppurativa_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Remission of hidradenitis suppurativa via lifestyle and medical intervention
  presenting_complaint: Follow-up of previously moderate HS.
  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old male with a 5-year history of Hurley Stage II HS underwent a rigorous management plan including smoking cessation and a 20kg weight loss through bariatric surgery. Combined with a 3-month course of Rifampicin/Clindamycin, his disease down-staged to Hurley Stage I (inactive). He now remains in clinical remission on no active medication, using only occasional antiseptic washes.
