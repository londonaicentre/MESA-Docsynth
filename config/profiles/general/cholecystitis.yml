cholecystitis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute calculous cholecystitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, nausea, and fever.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with a BMI of 32 presented with 12 hours of constant RUQ pain radiating to the right scapula. Examination revealed a positive Murphy's sign and pyrexia of 38.2°C; ultrasound confirmed multiple gallstones and a gallbladder wall thickness of 5mm. She underwent an uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy within 24 hours of admission and was discharged the following day.

cholecystitis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic cholecystitis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of biliary colic and post-prandial bloating.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with a history of ischaemic heart disease reported a six-month history of intermittent RUQ discomfort after fatty meals. Ultrasound showed a contracted, thick-walled gallbladder containing a large solitary stone. He was managed electively with a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, with histology confirming chronic follicular cholecystitis and fibrosis.

cholecystitis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute acalculous cholecystitis
  presenting_complaint: Sepsis and abdominal distension in a critically ill patient.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female currently in the ICU for severe burns and on total parenteral nutrition developed a sudden rise in inflammatory markers and hypotension. Bedside ultrasound demonstrated a distended gallbladder with wall oedema and pericholecystic fluid but no evidence of gallstones. Due to her unstable condition, she was treated with ultrasound-guided percutaneous cholecystostomy drainage and intravenous antibiotics.

cholecystitis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Gangrenous cholecystitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal pain, rigors, and clinical shock.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes presented with a 48-hour history of worsening RUQ pain and confusion. CT imaging revealed gas within the gallbladder wall and focal loss of wall enhancement, suggesting necrosis. He underwent an emergency open cholecystectomy which confirmed gangrenous changes; he required a prolonged course of piperacillin/tazobactam post-operatively.

cholecystitis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Emphysematous cholecystitis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of peritonitis and septic shock.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented with acute-onset generalized abdominal guarding and a lactate of 4.2 mmol/L. An abdominal radiograph and subsequent CT showed gas within the gallbladder lumen and wall, characteristic of infection by gas-forming organisms. He was rushed to theatre for an emergency laparotomy and cholecystectomy, where Clostridium perfringens was cultured from the bile.

cholecystitis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute cholecystitis with secondary choledocholithiasis
  presenting_complaint: RUQ pain, dark urine, and jaundice.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female presented with classic cholecystitis symptoms accompanied by an obstructive jaundice picture (Bilirubin 85 µmol/L, ALP 450 U/L). MRCP confirmed a stone impacted in the cystic duct and a secondary 6mm stone in the common bile duct (CBD). She underwent ERCP for CBD clearance followed by a laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the same admission.

cholecystitis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric acute cholecystitis
  presenting_complaint: RUQ pain and vomiting in a child.
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old boy with known hereditary spherocytosis presented with acute abdominal pain and low-grade fever. Ultrasound revealed multiple small pigment stones and significant gallbladder wall thickening. He was treated with intravenous fluids and underwent a combined laparoscopic cholecystectomy and splenectomy to prevent future haemolytic crises.

cholecystitis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Mirizzi Syndrome (Type I)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent jaundice and mild RUQ discomfort.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female presented with painless jaundice and a palpable gallbladder. Imaging revealed a large stone impacted in the gallbladder neck causing extrinsic compression of the common hepatic duct. She required a complex surgical intervention involving a partial cholecystectomy and T-tube placement to manage the biliary anatomy safely.

cholecystitis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Perforated cholecystitis with biliary peritonitis
  presenting_complaint: Generalized abdominal pain and profound hypotension.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female presented four days after the onset of RUQ pain, now with generalized rebound tenderness. CT abdomen showed a defect in the gallbladder fundus and free fluid in the paracolic gutters. Emergency laparotomy revealed biliary peritonitis and a perforated gallbladder; she required extensive peritoneal washout and intensive care support post-operatively.

cholecystitis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss, RUQ mass, and chronic dull ache.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male was investigated for a suspected gallbladder malignancy due to significant wall thickening and local liver invasion on CT. He underwent an open radical cholecystectomy; however, histopathology revealed xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis characterized by foamy macrophages and ceroid nodules. He made a full recovery with no evidence of malignancy.

cholecystitis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute cholecystitis in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent RUQ pain and inability to tolerate oral intake.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female at 22 weeks gestation presented with symptoms of cholecystitis that failed to resolve with simple analgesia. Ultrasound confirmed cholelithiasis and wall thickening without evidence of ductal dilatation. She was managed conservatively with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, with a plan for an elective cholecystectomy in the second trimester to avoid complications later in pregnancy.

cholecystitis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic cholecystitis with porcelain gallbladder
  presenting_complaint: Vague dyspepsia and epigastric fullness.
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old female underwent an abdominal radiograph for back pain, which incidentally showed a rim of calcification in the RUQ. Further CT imaging confirmed a "porcelain gallbladder" associated with chronic inflammation. Due to the historical association with an increased risk of gallbladder carcinoma, she was referred for an elective prophylactic cholecystectomy.

cholecystitis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Cholecystoduodenal fistula with gallstone ileus
  presenting_complaint: Small bowel obstruction symptoms including faeculent vomiting.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female presented with abdominal distension and vomiting; a CT scan showed Rigler’s triad (pneumobilia, small bowel obstruction, and an ectopic gallstone in the ileum). Surgery revealed a large stone had eroded through the gallbladder wall into the duodenum. An enterolithotomy was performed to remove the stone, but the fistula was left in situ due to her frailty.

cholecystitis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild acute calculous cholecystitis
  presenting_complaint: Moderate RUQ tenderness and low-grade pyrexia.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female presented to her GP with RUQ pain and was referred to the surgical assessment unit. Investigations showed a CRP of 25 mg/L and ultrasound evidence of stones but minimal wall thickening (3.5mm). She was successfully managed as an outpatient with oral co-amoxiclav and scheduled for an early elective cholecystectomy within six weeks.

cholecystitis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic cholecystitis
  presenting_complaint: Acute exacerbation of chronic RUQ pain and vomiting.
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old male with a history of recurrent biliary colic presented with a CRP of 150 mg/L and severe Murphy's sign. At surgery, the gallbladder was found to be extremely scarred and adherent to the duodenum and omentum, reflecting multiple previous inflammatory episodes. A subtotal cholecystectomy was performed to ensure safety and avoid injury to the biliary tree.

cholecystitis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Gallbladder empyema
  presenting_complaint: High swinging pyrexia and a palpable, tender RUQ mass.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female presented with a one-week history of RUQ pain and rigors. Ultrasound showed a distended gallbladder filled with heterogeneous debris, and aspiration during surgery confirmed frank pus (empyema). She required a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics and a difficult laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to the friable nature of the tissues.

cholecystitis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: CMV-associated acalculous cholecystitis
  presenting_complaint: Fever and RUQ pain in an immunocompromised patient.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male with HIV (CD4 count <50 cells/mm³) presented with systemic upset and RUQ tenderness. Imaging showed acalculous cholecystitis, and subsequent biopsy of the gallbladder mucosa during cholecystectomy revealed Cytomegalovirus inclusion bodies. He was treated with a course of intravenous ganciclovir alongside his antiretroviral therapy.

cholecystitis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-ERCP acute cholecystitis
  presenting_complaint: New onset RUQ pain 24 hours after a biliary procedure.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female underwent an ERCP for common bile duct stones; 24 hours later, she developed localized peritonitis in the RUQ. Repeat ultrasound showed new gallbladder wall thickening and a positive sonographic Murphy's sign, likely due to contrast injection or instrumentation. She was managed successfully with intravenous antibiotics and bowel rest.

cholecystitis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute cholecystitis with contiguous liver abscess
  presenting_complaint: RUQ pain, weight loss, and swinging pyrexia.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male presented with a two-week history of malaise and RUQ pain. CT imaging demonstrated a severely inflamed gallbladder with a 4cm abscess in the adjacent liver parenchyma (Segment IV). He underwent ultrasound-guided drainage of the abscess and a delayed cholecystectomy after six weeks of antibiotic therapy.

cholecystitis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Gallbladder volvulus (torsion)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, excruciating RUQ pain and a palpable mass.
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old female with a thin habitus presented with acute-onset abdominal pain and vomiting. CT imaging showed a "floating gallbladder" with a displaced axis and signs of ischaemia. Emergency surgery revealed a 360-degree clockwise torsion of the gallbladder on its mesentery; a cholecystectomy was performed, and she made a good recovery despite her age.
