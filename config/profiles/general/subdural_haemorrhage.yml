  presenting_complaint: GCS 3 and respiratory arrest following a fall from height
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male fell four metres from a ladder, sustaining a direct impact to the cranium. On arrival, he was intubated and CT showed a 25mm acute SDH with 15mm midline shift and signs of uncal herniation. Despite emergency decompressive surgery, he remained in a persistent vegetative state due to primary axonal injury and severe brainstem compression.

subdural_haemorrhage_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic subdural haemorrhage mimicking stroke
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset expressive aphasia
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female was brought to the stroke unit with suspected TIA/stroke due to sudden difficulty speaking. CT head instead revealed a subacute-to-chronic left-sided subdural haemorrhage compressing Broca's area. Her speech improved significantly within 48 hours of surgical drainage, confirming the haemorrhage as the cause of her focal deficits.

subdural_haemorrhage_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Coagulopathic subdural haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Altered mental status and bruising
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with decompensated liver cirrhosis and a platelet count of 40 x 10^9/L presented with confusion. CT head showed a moderate-sized SDH, complicated by a profound coagulopathy (INR 2.1). Management required multiple transfusions of platelets and fresh frozen plasma before neurosurgical intervention could be safely performed.
