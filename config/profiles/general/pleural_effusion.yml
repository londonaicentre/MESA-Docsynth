pleural_effusion_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute pancreatitis-associated pleural effusion
  presenting_complaint: Severe epigastric pain radiating to the back and breathlessness
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male was admitted with acute gallstone pancreatitis. On day three, he developed a moderate left-sided pleural effusion; thoracocentesis revealed an exudate with a significantly elevated amylase level (>2000 U/L). The effusion resolved as the underlying pancreatic inflammation was managed conservatively.

pleural_effusion_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Traumatic haemothorax
  presenting_complaint: Blunt chest trauma following a road traffic accident
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male presented to the A&E following a high-speed collision with respiratory distress and hypotension. CXR showed complete opacification of the left hemithorax. A large-bore (28F) chest drain was inserted, immediately evacuating 1,200mL of frank blood, necessitating urgent thoracotomy for haemorrhage control.

pleural_effusion_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Chylothorax post-oesophagectomy
  presenting_complaint: Increasing oxygen requirement five days post-thoracic surgery
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male underwent an Ivor-Lewis oesophagectomy for carcinoma. Post-operatively, he developed a large right-sided effusion; the drained fluid was milky in appearance with a triglyceride level of 6.2 mmol/L. He was initially managed with a medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) diet and octreotide, but eventually required thoracic duct ligation.
