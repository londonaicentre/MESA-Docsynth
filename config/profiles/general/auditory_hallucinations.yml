He reported frequent auditory hallucinations of children whispering in the next room, often accompanied by visual hallucinations of small animals. He was commenced on donepezil 5mg daily, which provided modest improvement in his neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive stability.

auditory_hallucinations_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of "angelic voices," seizures, and orofacial dyskinesia.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female presented acutely with bizarre behaviour and reports of hearing celestial music and "angels" speaking to her. Her condition rapidly deteriorated into catatonia and autonomic instability requiring ICU admission. CSF analysis confirmed anti-NMDAR antibodies; she underwent plasma exchange and IVIG therapy, leading to a slow but near-complete recovery over six months.

auditory_hallucinations_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Temporal lobe epilepsy
  presenting_complaint: Paroxysmal episodes of hearing "distorted radio static" and metallic clanging.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male reported brief, stereotyped episodes lasting 30 seconds where he heard loud, rhythmic metallic sounds followed by a rising epigastric sensation. Interictal EEG demonstrated sharp waves in the left temporal region. He was diagnosed with focal aware seizures and started on levetiracetam 500mg BD, which resulted in complete cessation of the auditory phenomena.

auditory_hallucinations_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-partum psychosis
  presenting_complaint: Command hallucinations to harm her newborn infant.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old primiparous woman, ten days post-emergency caesarean section, reported hearing a "god-like" voice telling her that her baby was a changeling. She was urgently admitted to a Mother and Baby Unit (MBU) for safety. Treatment involved a combination of olanzapine and lorazepam, with gradual resolution of psychotic symptoms and successful reintegration with her infant over six weeks.

auditory_hallucinations_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Treatment-resistant schizophrenia
  presenting_complaint: Persistent, loud derogatory voices despite multiple antipsychotic trials.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with a 30-year history of schizophrenia remained severely distressed by constant voices calling him "useless." Having failed trials of aripiprazole and haloperidol, he was transitioned to clozapine under strict FBC monitoring. After titrating to a therapeutic dose, his auditory hallucinations reduced in volume and frequency for the first time in a decade.

  presenting_complaint: Grandiose delusions and hearing "the voice of the universe" praising him.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male presented with a two-week history of decreased need for sleep, pressure of speech, and overspending. He reported hearing a booming, resonant voice that confirmed he was "the chosen one" and gave him instructions on how to save the world. He was stabilised on lithium and quetiapine, with the auditory hallucinations resolving as his mood returned to euthymia.

auditory_hallucinations_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
  presenting_complaint: Intrusive "internal" voices of a former commanding officer.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old military veteran presented with flashbacks and hypervigilance. He described hearing the shouting voice of his late sergeant during periods of high stress, which he perceived as coming from "inside his head" rather than through his ears. He was engaged in Trauma-Focused CBT and EMDR, which helped reduce the frequency and distress associated with these pseudo-hallucinations.

auditory_hallucinations_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Musical Ear Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Continuous hearing of "God Save the King" in a quiet room.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old female with severe bilateral sensorineural hearing loss reported being bothered by repetitive orchestral music that no one else could hear. Audiological assessment confirmed the hallucinations were non-psychotic and triggered by sensory deprivation (deafferentation). Management involved optimising her hearing aids and using low-level background white noise, which successfully masked the phantom music.

auditory_hallucinations_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Synthetic cannabinoid-induced psychosis
  presenting_complaint: Acute agitation and hearing "demons" plotting to kill him.
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old male was brought to A&E by police after acting violently in a public park. He had smoked "Spice" and subsequently developed intense auditory hallucinations of multiple voices threatening his life.

  primary_diagnosis: Very early-onset schizophrenia
  presenting_complaint: A 12-year-old hearing "the monster" talking from the vents.
  summary_of_course: A pre-adolescent boy was referred to CAMHS due to declining school performance and strange comments about "the monster" who lived in the school vents and told him to steal. Detailed assessment revealed complex auditory hallucinations and thought blocking. He was started on a paediatric-specific regime of aripiprazole, requiring significant family support and educational adjustments.

  presenting_complaint: Hearing "ghostly whispers" and seeing "shadow people."
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with long-standing Parkinson's disease, managed with high-dose levodopa, began hearing muffled conversations in empty rooms. The hallucinations were initially non-distressing but became increasingly paranoid. His neurologist reduced his dopamine agonist dose and added low-dose quetiapine, which mitigated the auditory symptoms without significantly worsening his motor tremors.

auditory_hallucinations_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type
  presenting_complaint: Chronic low mood and voices telling her to "end it all."
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female with a history of recurrent depression and psychosis presented with a heavy depressive episode and persistent derogatory auditory hallucinations. Unlike pure depression, the voices persisted even when her mood was relatively stable. She was successfully managed with a combination of sertraline and paliperidone depot injections, providing better compliance and symptom control.

auditory_hallucinations_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Myxoedema madness (Hypothyroidism)
  presenting_complaint: Profound lethargy, weight gain, and hearing "muffled chanting."
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female was referred to psychiatry for new-onset psychotic symptoms including hearing rhythmic chanting. Physical examination noted macroglossia, dry skin, and delayed tendon reflexes. Blood tests revealed a TSH >100 mIU/L and undetectable T4; her "psychosis" resolved entirely within three weeks of starting levothyroxine replacement therapy.

auditory_hallucinations_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)
  presenting_complaint: Stress-related "internal" voices and self-harm urges.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old female described hearing multiple conflicting voices that criticized her appearance and urged her to cut herself during interpersonal conflicts. The voices were described as "loud thoughts" rather than external sounds and were highly mood-dependent. She was treated with Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT), focusing on distress tolerance and emotional regulation, which reduced the impact of the voices.

auditory_hallucinations_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Migraine with auditory aura
  presenting_complaint: Hearing "rushing water" and "tinkling bells" before a headache.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old woman presented with recurrent episodes of hearing a loud rushing sound followed by high-pitched bell-like noises, lasting 20 minutes. These sounds were invariably followed by a unilateral throbbing headache and photophobia. She was diagnosed with migraine with atypical aura and started on propranolol prophylaxis, which reduced both the frequency of the headaches and the auditory phenomena.

auditory_hallucinations_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Cerebral abscess (Temporal lobe)
  presenting_complaint: Fever, headache, and hearing "unintelligible murmurs" in the right ear.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with a recent history of otitis media presented with a worsening headache and auditory hallucinations localized to his right side. CT imaging revealed a 3cm ring-enhancing lesion in the right temporal lobe. Following neurosurgical drainage and six weeks of IV antibiotics, his fever subsided and the auditory hallucinations disappeared.

auditory_hallucinations_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypnopompic hallucinations
  presenting_complaint: Hearing her name being called loudly upon waking up.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female student reported several episodes of hearing a family member's voice calling her name just as she was waking up, though she was alone in her room. These were often accompanied by sleep paralysis. After a sleep study ruled out narcolepsy, she was reassured that these were benign hypnopompic hallucinations related to an irregular sleep-wake cycle and stress.

auditory_hallucinations_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Major depressive disorder with psychotic features
  presenting_complaint: Severe nihilistic delusions and a voice saying "you are dead."
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male was admitted with catatonic features and refusal to eat or drink. He reported a single, monotonous voice that repeatedly told him his internal organs had rotted and that he was already dead. Due to the severity of his nutritional decline and psychosis, he was treated with a course of bilateral ECT, resulting in a dramatic improvement in both mood and the cessation of the nihilistic voice.
