primary_cancer_testicular_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Classical Seminoma
  presenting_complaint: Painless swelling in the right testicle
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male presented with a firm, painless 2cm nodule in the right testis. Ultrasound confirmed a solid intra-testicular mass, and serum markers (AFP, hCG, LDH) were within normal limits. He underwent a right radical inguinal orchidectomy, with histology confirming Stage IA classical seminoma, and opted for active surveillance.

primary_cancer_testicular_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Non-Seminomatous Germ Cell Tumour (NSGCT)
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly enlarging left scrotal mass and dull ache
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male presented with a three-week history of rapid testicular enlargement. Investigations revealed significantly elevated AFP (450 kU/L) and hCG (1,200 IU/L), with CT staging showing no metastatic disease. Following inguinal orchidectomy, histology showed a mixed germ cell tumour (60% embryonal carcinoma, 40% yolk sac), and he commenced one cycle of adjuvant BEP chemotherapy.

primary_cancer_testicular_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Metastatic Mixed Germ Cell Tumour
  presenting_complaint: Severe lower back pain and unintentional weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male with a history of neglected testicular swelling presented with debilitating lumbar pain. CT imaging revealed an 8cm retroperitoneal lymph node mass compressing the ureters and multiple "cannonball" pulmonary metastases. He was diagnosed with IGCCCG poor-prognosis metastatic NSGCT and urgently commenced four cycles of BEP chemotherapy.

primary_cancer_testicular_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary Testicular Lymphoma
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral testicular enlargement and night sweats
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male presented with subacute, bilateral scrotal heaviness and systemic B-symptoms. Ultrasound showed diffuse infiltration of both testes, and biopsy confirmed Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). He was treated with bilateral orchidectomy followed by R-CHOP chemotherapy and prophylactic intrathecal methotrexate due to the high risk of CNS relapse.

primary_cancer_testicular_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Choriocarcinoma with Choriocarcinoma Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Haemoptysis, headache, and scrotal tenderness
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male presented in the Emergency Department with acute respiratory distress and focal neurological deficits. Serum hCG was extremely high at 850,000 IU/L, and imaging showed widespread haemorrhagic metastases in the lungs and brain. Despite intensive care admission and "ultra-low dose" induction chemotherapy, he developed fatal pulmonary haemorrhage (choriocarcinoma syndrome).

primary_cancer_testicular_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Yolk Sac Tumour (Paediatric)
  presenting_complaint: Scrotal swelling in a toddler
  summary_of_course: A 2-year-old boy was brought in by his parents with a firm, non-tender left scrotal mass. Serum AFP was markedly elevated at 12,000 kU/L for his age. He underwent a successful inguinal orchidectomy, and histology confirmed a pure yolk sac tumour; post-operative staging was negative, and he remains on close paediatric oncology surveillance.

primary_cancer_testicular_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Leydig Cell Tumour
  presenting_complaint: New-onset gynaecomastia and loss of libido
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male presented with bilateral breast enlargement and endocrine dysfunction. Physical examination revealed a small, hard nodule in the left testis which was initially missed on palpation but caught on ultrasound. Following orchidectomy, histology confirmed a benign Leydig cell tumour, and his hormonal profile and gynaecomastia resolved over the following six months.

primary_cancer_testicular_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Burned-out Testicular Tumour
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of a retroperitoneal mass
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male underwent CT imaging for vague abdominal pain, which revealed a 5cm para-aortic lymph node mass. Testicular examination was unremarkable, but ultrasound showed a small area of scarring and microlithiasis in the left testis. Histology from the retroperitoneal biopsy confirmed metastatic seminoma, representing a "burned-out" primary testicular tumour that had spontaneously regressed.

primary_cancer_testicular_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Teratoma with Somatic-Type Malignancy
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent testicular mass post-chemotherapy
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male previously treated for NSGCT presented with a growing retroperitoneal mass despite normalised tumour markers. Surgical resection (RPLND) was performed, and pathology revealed a teratoma that had undergone malignant transformation into a rhabdomyosarcoma. This rare complication required further specialised sarcoma-protocol chemotherapy.

primary_cancer_testicular_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Sertoli Cell Tumour (Large Cell Calcifying)
  presenting_complaint: Multiple small lumps in both testicles
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with a known history of Carney Complex presented for routine screening. Ultrasound identified multiple bilateral calcified nodules, and limited excision (testis-sparing surgery) was performed to preserve endocrine function. Histology confirmed large cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumours, which are typically benign in this genetic context.

primary_cancer_testicular_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Seminoma in an Undescended Testis
  presenting_complaint: Acute lower abdominal pain and a palpable groin mass
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with a history of an uncorrected left cryptorchidism presented with acute inguinal pain mimicking a strangulated hernia. Emergency exploration revealed a large, necrotic tumour within an undescended testis located in the inguinal canal. Histology confirmed a classical seminoma, and he subsequently received adjuvant radiotherapy to the para-aortic lymph nodes.

primary_cancer_testicular_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Embryonal Carcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Dull ache in the scrotum and a small, hard lump
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old male presented with a 1cm nodule in the right testis. Serum AFP was mildly elevated, but hCG was significantly high. Histology following orchidectomy showed pure embryonal carcinoma with lymphovascular invasion (LVI), placing him at high risk for recurrence; he elected for two cycles of adjuvant BEP chemotherapy rather than surveillance.

primary_cancer_testicular_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Synchronous Bilateral Seminoma
  presenting_complaint: Heaviness and swelling in both testicles
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male presented with simultaneous enlargement of both testes over four months. Ultrasound confirmed bilateral solid masses, and he underwent bilateral radical inguinal orchidectomy. Histology showed Stage I seminoma on both sides, and he was started on lifelong testosterone replacement therapy and offered sperm cryopreservation.

primary_cancer_testicular_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Growing Teratoma Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Increasing abdominal girth during chemotherapy
  summary_of_course: A 23-year-old male undergoing treatment for metastatic NSGCT showed a paradoxical increase in the size of his retroperitoneal lymph nodes while his AFP and hCG levels were falling to normal. This clinical picture was diagnostic of Growing Teratoma Syndrome. He underwent a complex retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) to remove the chemo-resistant mature teratoma.

primary_cancer_testicular_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Testicular Seminoma with Paraneoplastic Limbic Encephalitis
  presenting_complaint: Acute confusion, memory loss, and seizures
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old male was admitted to neurology with unexplained encephalopathy and anti-Ma2 antibodies in his CSF. A dedicated scrotal ultrasound was performed to look for an occult primary, which identified a sub-centimetre seminoma. Treatment of the primary cancer and immunotherapy led to a gradual improvement in his neurological status.

primary_cancer_testicular_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Late Relapse of Seminoma
  presenting_complaint: New back pain 12 years after initial diagnosis
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male, who had a Stage I seminoma treated with orchidectomy and surveillance 12 years prior, presented with new lumbar pain. CT imaging showed a 4cm para-aortic mass, and biopsy confirmed recurrent seminoma. Despite the long interval, the tumour remained exquisitely chemosensitive, and he achieved complete remission after three cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

primary_cancer_testicular_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Testicular Dysgenesis Syndrome associated Germ Cell Neoplasia In Situ (GCNIS)
  presenting_complaint: Subfertility and scrotal microlithiasis
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male undergoing investigations for primary infertility was found to have diffuse testicular microlithiasis and a small hypoechoic area on ultrasound. A biopsy of the suspicious area confirmed Germ Cell Neoplasia In Situ (GCNIS) with an adjacent 5mm microinvasive seminoma. He underwent a partial orchidectomy and was counselled on the high risk of future invasive cancer.

primary_cancer_testicular_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Extragonadal Germ Cell Tumour (Primary Mediastinal)
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath and superior vena cava syndrome
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male presented with facial swelling and dyspnoea. Imaging revealed a massive 15cm anterior mediastinal mass, while testicular examination and ultrasound were completely normal. Biopsy confirmed a primary mediastinal non-seminomatous germ cell tumour; this carries a poorer prognosis than testicular primaries and required intensive VIP (Etoposide, Ifosfamide, Cisplatin) chemotherapy.

primary_cancer_testicular_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Mixed Germ Cell Tumour
  presenting_complaint: Persistent elevation of AFP after standard chemotherapy
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old male with Stage III NSGCT completed four cycles of BEP, but his AFP plateaued at 80 kU/L. Subsequent PET-CT showed residual metabolic activity in the retroperitoneum and lungs. He was transitioned to salvage high-dose chemotherapy (carboplatin and etoposide) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation.

primary_cancer_testicular_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Seminoma presenting as Acute Scrotum
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, severe testicular pain and redness
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male presented with a 6-hour history of acute scrotal pain, mimicking testicular torsion. Surgical exploration revealed an enlarged, haemorrhagic testis, but no torsion was found. Intra-operative frozen section biopsy indicated a malignant process, and orchidectomy was performed, with final histology confirming a seminoma with extensive intratumoural haemorrhage.
