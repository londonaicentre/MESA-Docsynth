congenital_heart_disease_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA)
  presenting_complaint: Cyanosis and tachypnoea within hours of birth
  summary_of_course: A full-term neonate presented with profound cyanosis unresponsive to oxygen therapy (saturations 65%). Echocardiography confirmed D-TGA with a restrictive patent foramen ovale. Following an urgent balloon atrial septostomy and prostaglandin E1 infusion, the infant underwent a successful arterial switch operation on day 5 of life.

congenital_heart_disease_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Secundum Atrial Septal Defect (ASD)
  presenting_complaint: Exertional dyspnoea and palpitations
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female was referred from primary care after a routine check-up revealed a fixed split second heart sound and a systolic flow murmur. Transoesophageal echocardiography demonstrated a 22mm secundum ASD with significant left-to-right shunting (Qp:Qs 2.1:1) and right ventricular dilatation. The patient underwent successful percutaneous device closure with an Amplatzer occluder, resulting in immediate symptomatic improvement.

congenital_heart_disease_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Large Perimembranous Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)
  presenting_complaint: Poor feeding, failure to thrive, and diaphoresis
  summary_of_course: A 4-month-old infant presented with respiratory distress and poor weight gain. Examination revealed a loud pansystolic murmur and hepatomegaly, while imaging showed a large perimembranous VSD with pulmonary overcirculation. Despite maximal medical management with furosemide and spironolactone, the infant required surgical patch closure to prevent irreversible pulmonary vascular disease.

congenital_heart_disease_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) with Pulmonary Atresia
  presenting_complaint: Severe cyanosis and "tet spells"
  summary_of_course: A 2-month-old infant with known ToF experienced increasing frequency of hypercyanotic episodes. Cardiac catheterisation revealed pulmonary atresia with multiple aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs). The patient underwent a multi-stage surgical programme, starting with a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt to improve pulmonary blood flow before definitive unifocalisation and repair.

congenital_heart_disease_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Coarctation of the Aorta
  presenting_complaint: Hypertension and weak femoral pulses
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old male was investigated for refractory hypertension (165/95 mmHg) discovered during a sports physical. Clinical examination identified a significant blood pressure gradient between upper and lower limbs and delayed femoral pulses. CT aortogram confirmed a discrete coarctation distal to the left subclavian artery, which was successfully treated with covered stent implantation.

congenital_heart_disease_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Eisenmenger Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Progressive cyanosis, clubbing, and haemoptysis
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female with an unrepaired large VSD presented with worsening exercise intolerance and central cyanosis (saturations 78% on room air). Investigations confirmed irreversible pulmonary hypertension with shunt reversal (right-to-left). Management focused on supportive care, including pulmonary vasodilators (sildenafil and bosentan) and phlebotomy for symptomatic erythrocytosis, as the patient was no longer a candidate for surgical repair.

congenital_heart_disease_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS)
  presenting_complaint: Cardiovascular collapse on day 2 of life
  summary_of_course: A neonate appeared well at birth but collapsed following closure of the ductus arteriosus. Echocardiography revealed mitral and aortic atresia with a diminutive left ventricle. The infant was stabilised with prostaglandin E1 and underwent the first stage of the Fontan sequence (Norwood procedure with Sano shunt), followed by intensive care management for low cardiac output syndrome.

congenital_heart_disease_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA)
  presenting_complaint: Bounding pulses and wide pulse pressure in a preterm infant
  summary_of_course: A 27-week gestation neonate developed respiratory distress syndrome and was unable to wean from mechanical ventilation. A large, haemodynamically significant PDA was identified via bedside echocardiography. After failing two courses of intravenous ibuprofen, the infant underwent successful surgical ligation in the neonatal intensive care unit.

congenital_heart_disease_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Ebstein's Anomaly
  presenting_complaint: Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with mild cyanosis presented to the emergency department with a narrow-complex tachycardia at 210 bpm. Echocardiography showed apical displacement of the tricuspid valve leaflets and "atrialisation" of the right ventricle. Electrophysiology studies identified an accessory pathway (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome), which was successfully ablated, and the patient remains under surveillance for progressive tricuspid regurgitation.

congenital_heart_disease_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Fontan Circulation Failure
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal bloating, chronic diarrhoea, and peripheral oedema
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old male with a previous Fontan completion for tricuspid atresia presented with features of protein-losing enteropathy (PLE). Laboratory tests showed profound hypoalbuminaemia and elevated faecal alpha-1 antitrypsin. Despite optimising Fontan pressures and dietary modifications, the patient's condition deteriorated, necessitating evaluation for cardiac transplantation.

congenital_heart_disease_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Bicuspid Aortic Valve with Infective Endocarditis
  presenting_complaint: Fever, night sweats, and a new diastolic murmur
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with a known bicuspid aortic valve presented with a 3-week history of pyrexia of unknown origin. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridans, and transoesophageal echo showed a 10mm vegetation on the aortic valve with associated severe regurgitation. He completed a 6-week course of intravenous benzylpenicillin and gentamicin before undergoing elective aortic valve replacement.

congenital_heart_disease_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Sinus Venosus ASD with Partial Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Drainage (PAPVD)
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of right heart enlargement on chest X-ray
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old asymptomatic male underwent a chest X-ray for a persistent cough, which revealed cardiomegaly. Subsequent MRI confirmed a superior sinus venosus ASD and the right upper pulmonary vein draining into the superior vena cava. The patient underwent a Warden procedure to baffle the anomalous vein to the left atrium and patch the defect.

congenital_heart_disease_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Double Outlet Right Ventricle (DORV)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic cyanosis and clubbing in a toddler
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old child from a region with limited healthcare access presented with significant cyanosis. Imaging revealed both the aorta and pulmonary artery arising from the right ventricle, with a subaortic VSD (Fallot-type DORV). The patient underwent a successful intraventricular tunnel repair to connect the left ventricle to the aorta.

congenital_heart_disease_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Scimitar Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent right-sided pneumonia and exertional dyspnoea
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female was investigated for repeated respiratory infections and dextrocardia on imaging. CT pulmonary angiography identified anomalous pulmonary venous drainage of the entire right lung into the inferior vena cava, appearing as a "scimitar" sign. Due to a significant left-to-right shunt and recurrent symptoms, she underwent surgical redirection of the anomalous venous return to the left atrium.

congenital_heart_disease_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Marfan Syndrome with Aortic Root Dilatation
  presenting_complaint: Routine screening due to family history
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male with marfanoid habitus was screened following his father's aortic dissection. Echocardiography revealed an aortic root diameter of 48mm (Z-score +4.5). He was commenced on losartan and atenolol for blood pressure control and underwent a prophylactic valve-sparing aortic root replacement (David procedure) to prevent dissection.

congenital_heart_disease_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Congenital Valvular Pulmonary Stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic systolic murmur
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old girl was referred after a harsh ejection systolic murmur was heard during a school physical. Echocardiography showed thickened pulmonary valve leaflets with a peak gradient of 65 mmHg, indicating moderate-to-severe stenosis. She underwent successful percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty, reducing the gradient to 15 mmHg with minimal residual regurgitation.

congenital_heart_disease_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Congenitally Corrected Transposition of the Great Arteries (ccTGA)
  presenting_complaint: Syncope and bradycardia
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented with a syncopal episode and was found to have third-degree heart block on ECG. Imaging revealed atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial discordance (ccTGA), with the morphological right ventricle serving the systemic circulation. A dual-chamber pacemaker was implanted, but the patient requires close monitoring for systemic ventricular dysfunction.

congenital_heart_disease_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Cor Triatriatum Sinister
  presenting_complaint: Dyspnoea and pulmonary oedema mimicking mitral stenosis
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy presented with acute shortness of breath and fine crackles at the lung bases. Echocardiography identified a fibromuscular membrane dividing the left atrium into two chambers, causing significant obstruction to pulmonary venous return. The membrane was surgically excised, leading to complete resolution of symptoms and normalisation of left atrial pressures.

congenital_heart_disease_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Persistent Left Superior Vena Cava (PLSVC)
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty passing a central venous catheter
  summary_of_course: During a routine elective surgery for an unrelated condition, clinicians noted an unusual catheter trajectory during left-sided internal jugular vein cannulation. A subsequent echocardiogram with bubble study confirmed a PLSVC draining into a dilated coronary sinus. This was an incidental, benign finding with no haemodynamic significance, requiring no further intervention.

congenital_heart_disease_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) with Paradoxical Embolism
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset left-sided weakness and facial droop
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old previously healthy male suffered a cryptogenic ischaemic stroke. A transoesophageal echocardiogram with agitated saline contrast (bubble study) demonstrated a significant right-to-left shunt across a PFO during the Valsalva manoeuvre. Following a multidisciplinary review, the patient underwent percutaneous PFO closure to reduce the risk of recurrent embolic events.
