amoebic_liver_abscess_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute amoebic liver abscess
  presenting_complaint: High-grade fever, rigors, and sharp right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male recently returned from a three-month backpacking trip in South Asia. Clinical examination revealed hepatomegaly and point tenderness over the lower ribs. Ultrasound (US) identified a 7cm solitary hypoechoic lesion in the right lobe, and Entamoeba histolytica serology was strongly positive. He was successfully treated with a 10-day course of metronidazole followed by diloxanide furoate to eradicate luminal cysts.

amoebic_liver_abscess_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic amoebic liver abscess
  presenting_complaint: Unintentional weight loss, low-grade pyrexia, and dull abdominal ache.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with a history of travel to endemic regions decades ago presented with symptoms mimicking malignancy. Contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) showed a thick-walled 5cm liver lesion with peripheral enhancement; blood tests showed mild anaemia of chronic disease and a raised alkaline phosphatase. Amoebic gel diffusion precipitin test was positive, and the patient showed significant clinical improvement after targeted anti-amoebic therapy.

amoebic_liver_abscess_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Ruptured amoebic liver abscess with peritonitis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of generalised abdominal pain and clinical shock.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented to the A&E in a state of collapse with a rigid, board-like abdomen. Emergency laparotomy revealed a ruptured abscess in the right lobe of the liver with "anchovy sauce" pus draining into the peritoneal cavity. Following surgical peritoneal lavage and drainage, he was stabilised in the ICU with IV metronidazole and supportive care for septic shock.

amoebic_liver_abscess_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Amoebic liver abscess with pleuropulmonary involvement
  presenting_complaint: Persistent cough, right-sided pleuritic chest pain, and dyspnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male was initially treated for community-acquired pneumonia with no response. Chest X-ray showed a raised right hemidiaphragm and a pleural effusion; subsequent US-abdomen revealed a large superior right lobe liver abscess breaching the diaphragm. Thoracocentesis yielded sterile "chocolate-coloured" fluid, and the patient required a chest tube alongside systemic metronidazole.

amoebic_liver_abscess_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Left lobe amoebic liver abscess
  presenting_complaint: Severe epigastric pain radiating to the left shoulder and nausea.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female presented with acute epigastric distress. Imaging confirmed a 6cm abscess in the left hepatic lobe, posing a high risk of rupture into the pericardial space. Due to the location, ultrasound-guided needle aspiration was performed immediately to reduce pressure, and she was maintained on a strict course of tinidazole.

amoebic_liver_abscess_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Amoebic liver abscess in a paediatric patient
  presenting_complaint: Irritability, high fever, and refusal to feed.
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old boy from an immigrant family presented with a 5-day history of spiking fevers and abdominal distension. Ultrasound showed a 4cm fluid collection in the liver, and despite negative stool microscopy, amoebic serology was positive. He responded rapidly to intravenous metronidazole and was discharged on oral paromomycin.

amoebic_liver_abscess_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Multiple amoebic liver abscesses in an immunocompromised host
  presenting_complaint: Profuse sweating, malaise, and multi-focal abdominal tenderness.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old HIV-positive male presented with sepsis and multiple small abscesses scattered throughout both liver lobes on CT. Differential diagnoses included pyogenic and fungal abscesses, but PCR of the aspirate confirmed Entamoeba histolytica. He required a prolonged 3-week course of IV metronidazole and optimization of his antiretroviral therapy.

amoebic_liver_abscess_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Amoebic liver abscess with hepatobronchial fistula
  presenting_complaint: Productive cough with large amounts of reddish-brown sputum.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male presented with "chocolate-coloured" expectoration following a month of RUQ pain. CT imaging demonstrated a large liver abscess communicating with the right lower lobe bronchus through a diaphragmatic defect. He was managed with postural drainage, high-dose metronidazole, and luminal agents, avoiding the need for thoracic surgery.

amoebic_liver_abscess_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent amoebic liver abscess
  presenting_complaint: Return of fever and RUQ pain three months after initial treatment.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male who had been treated for ALA abroad presented with recurring symptoms. Investigation revealed he had not completed his course of luminal amoebicides (diloxanide furoate), leading to re-infection from persistent intestinal cysts. He was retreated with tinidazole and a strictly monitored course of paromomycin.

amoebic_liver_abscess_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute amoebic liver abscess with secondary bacterial infection
  presenting_complaint: Spiking fevers despite 5 days of oral metronidazole.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male initially diagnosed with ALA failed to improve on standard therapy. Aspiration of the abscess was performed, and cultures grew Escherichia coli, indicating secondary bacterial seeding of the amoebic cavity. His regimen was broadened to include ceftriaxone, leading to eventual resolution of the 10cm collection.

amoebic_liver_abscess_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Amoebic liver abscess in a non-traveller (MSM)
  presenting_complaint: Fever, diarrhoea, and tender hepatomegaly.
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old male with no history of foreign travel presented with classic ALA symptoms. Given his history as a man who has sex with men (MSM), amoebiasis was suspected as a sexually transmitted infection. ELISA confirmed the diagnosis, highlighting the importance of considering ALA in non-travellers within specific risk groups.

amoebic_liver_abscess_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Amoebic liver abscess presenting as pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO)
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent fevers for six weeks and mild lethargy.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female underwent an extensive PUO workup including bone marrow biopsy and PET-CT. The PET-CT showed an FDG-avid lesion in the liver, which was confirmed as an amoebic abscess on serology. She had no history of diarrhoea or recent travel, making the diagnosis a significant clinical challenge.

amoebic_liver_abscess_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Amoebic liver abscess with rupture into the pericardium
  presenting_complaint: Sudden chest pain, muffled heart sounds, and severe hypotension.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male with a known left-lobe ALA suddenly deteriorated with signs of cardiac tamponade. Emergency pericardiocentesis yielded "anchovy paste" fluid, confirming rupture through the diaphragm into the pericardial sac. He underwent emergency surgery and intensive post-operative care, narrowly surviving the event.

amoebic_liver_abscess_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Amoebic liver abscess in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Right-sided upper abdominal pain and fever at 26 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old pregnant woman presented with RUQ pain and was found to have a 5cm liver abscess on US. To minimize prolonged high-dose nitroimidazole exposure to the foetus, US-guided aspiration was performed to reduce the parasite load, followed by a shortened, carefully monitored course of metronidazole.

amoebic_liver_abscess_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Large amoebic liver abscess requiring percutaneous drainage
  presenting_complaint: Severe RUQ pain and inability to lie flat.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male presented with a massive 15cm abscess in the right lobe, causing significant mass effect and respiratory compromise. Due to the high risk of spontaneous rupture, a pigtail catheter was inserted percutaneously under radiological guidance. Over 1 litre of characteristic pus was drained over 72 hours, alongside systemic anti-amoebic therapy.

amoebic_liver_abscess_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Amoebic liver abscess with obstructive jaundice
  presenting_complaint: Yellowing of the sclera, dark urine, and RUQ discomfort.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male presented with jaundice and a palpable liver mass. Imaging showed a 6cm abscess located at the porta hepatis, causing extrinsic compression of the common hepatic duct. The jaundice resolved rapidly as the abscess size decreased following the initiation of metronidazole.

amoebic_liver_abscess_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Amoebic liver abscess mimicking acute cholecystitis
  presenting_complaint: RUQ pain, positive Murphy's sign, and vomiting.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old female was admitted for suspected cholecystitis. However, ultrasound showed a normal gallbladder but a 4cm liquefied lesion in the adjacent liver parenchyma. Serology for E. histolytica was positive, and she was successfully managed medically, avoiding unnecessary cholecystectomy.

amoebic_liver_abscess_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Amoebic liver abscess with cutaneous fistula
  presenting_complaint: Spontaneous drainage of brownish fluid through the skin of the right flank.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male from a rural background presented with a neglected liver abscess that had formed a "pleuro-cutaneous" tract. Examination revealed a discharging sinus in the right intercostal space. CT confirmed the tract originated from a large hepatic abscess; he required surgical debridement and long-term antibiotic and anti-amoebic therapy.

amoebic_liver_abscess_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Amoebic liver abscess in a patient with alcoholic liver disease
  presenting_complaint: Fever, worsening ascites, and RUQ pain.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with known cirrhosis presented with what was initially thought to be spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Paracentesis was inconclusive, but CT showed a 5cm abscess; the challenge was distinguishing ALA from a necrotic hepatocellular carcinoma. Positive amoebic serology and a rapid response to metronidazole confirmed the diagnosis.

amoebic_liver_abscess_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild amoebic liver abscess
  presenting_complaint: Vague abdominal discomfort and low-grade fever.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female student presented to her GP two weeks after returning from India. US showed a small 2cm abscess in the right lobe, and she was haemodynamically stable with only mildly deranged LFTs. She was treated successfully as an outpatient with oral tinidazole and followed up with repeat imaging to ensure resolution.
