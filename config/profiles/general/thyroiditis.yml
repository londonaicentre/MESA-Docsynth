thyroiditis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Hashimoto's thyroiditis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented to her GP with a six-month history of lethargy and constipation. Physical examination revealed a firm, non-tender diffuse goitre. Investigations showed an elevated TSH of 15.2 mIU/L, low free T4, and strongly positive anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies. She was commenced on Levothyroxine 75mcg daily with gradual resolution of symptoms.

thyroiditis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (De Quervain's)
  presenting_complaint: Severe anterior neck pain radiating to the ears and fever.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male presented two weeks after a viral upper respiratory tract infection with exquisite neck tenderness and tachycardia. Laboratory tests showed a suppressed TSH, elevated free T4, and a significantly raised ESR of 85 mm/hr. Technetium-99m uptake scan showed low global uptake, confirming the diagnosis. He was treated with a tapering course of Prednisolone and Propranolol for symptomatic relief.

thyroiditis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Postpartum thyroiditis
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations and anxiety four months after delivery.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old primiparous woman reported sudden onset nervousness and heat intolerance. Initial biochemistry confirmed thyrotoxicosis with suppressed TSH, but three months later she transitioned into a hypothyroid phase with a TSH of 12.0 mIU/L. Her thyroid function spontaneously normalised by 12 months postpartum without long-term Levothyroxine requirement.

thyroiditis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute suppurative thyroiditis
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of painful neck swelling, high fever, and dysphagia.
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old girl with a known pyriform sinus fistula presented with a fluctuant, erythematous mass in the left thyroid lobe. Ultrasound confirmed an abscess within the thyroid gland, and fine-needle aspiration grew Streptococcus pyogenes. She required intravenous Co-amoxiclav and surgical drainage, followed by elective excision of the fistula tract.

thyroiditis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Amiodarone-induced thyroiditis (Type 2)
  presenting_complaint: New onset of breathlessness and palpitations in a patient with known heart failure.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male taking Amiodarone for atrial fibrillation developed sudden thyrotoxicosis. Colour flow Doppler ultrasound showed absent vascularity, suggesting a destructive thyroiditis (Type 2) rather than hyperthyroidism (Type 1). He was treated with high-dose Prednisolone while continuing his cardiac medications under close endocrine supervision.

thyroiditis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Riedel's thyroiditis
  presenting_complaint: Progressive "woody" hard neck swelling and inspiratory stridor.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female presented with a rapidly enlarging, painless, stone-hard goitre and exertional dyspnoea. Core needle biopsy revealed dense fibrous tissue extending into adjacent strap muscles, with no evidence of malignancy. She was started on Tamoxifen and Prednisolone to reduce the fibrotic process, which successfully improved her obstructive symptoms.

thyroiditis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Silent (painless) thyroiditis
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of low TSH during routine health screening.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old asymptomatic male was found to have a suppressed TSH of 0.05 mIU/L on routine bloods. He denied neck pain or recent illness, and TPO antibodies were mildly elevated. A radioactive iodine uptake scan was low, and he remained clinically euthyroid during a period of "watchful waiting" until his biochemistry normalised six weeks later.

thyroiditis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Hashimoto's encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Acute confusion, seizures, and cognitive decline.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism was admitted to the neurology ward with status epilepticus. CSF analysis was unremarkable, but serum anti-TPO antibodies were extremely high (>2000 IU/mL). She showed a dramatic clinical improvement following high-dose intravenous Methylprednisolone, confirming the diagnosis of steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis.

thyroiditis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Pembrolizumab-induced thyroiditis
  presenting_complaint: Routine monitoring of thyroid function during immunotherapy for melanoma.
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male undergoing treatment with a PD-1 inhibitor developed a transient thyrotoxic phase (TSH <0.01 mIU/L) followed rapidly by profound hypothyroidism within four weeks. This immune-related adverse event was managed by initiating Levothyroxine 100mcg daily. He was able to continue his oncology treatment as the thyroid dysfunction was well-controlled.

thyroiditis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Radiation-induced thyroiditis
  presenting_complaint: Neck discomfort and palpitations one week after Radioiodine therapy.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female with Graves' disease underwent I-131 ablation. Seven days later, she developed acute thyroid tenderness and an exacerbation of hyperthyroid symptoms due to radiation-induced follicle destruction and hormone release. She was managed with a short course of NSAIDs and increased Beta-blockers, with symptoms resolving within ten days.

thyroiditis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute thyroiditis with thyroid storm
  presenting_complaint: High fever, delirium, and severe tachycardia (AF).
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with multiple comorbidities presented with a Burch-Wartofsky score of 55, triggered by a severe case of De Quervain's thyroiditis. He was admitted to the ICU for aggressive management with Propranolol, Hydrocortisone, and inorganic iodine to block hormone release. Despite the initial severity, he survived and later developed permanent hypothyroidism.

thyroiditis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis with primary thyroid lymphoma
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly enlarging goitre over two weeks in a patient with long-standing Hashimoto's.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female, stable on Levothyroxine for decades, presented with sudden neck growth and hoarseness. Ultrasound showed a large hypoechoic mass, and an urgent core biopsy confirmed Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma arising in the background of chronic thyroiditis. She was urgently referred for chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

thyroiditis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Lithium-induced painless thyroiditis
  presenting_complaint: New onset tremor and weight loss in a patient with bipolar disorder.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male on long-term Lithium therapy developed biochemical thyrotoxicosis. Clinical examination revealed no thyroid tenderness, and uptake scans confirmed a silent thyroiditis pattern likely exacerbated by Lithium's effect on thyroid follicle stability. The Lithium was continued after psychiatric consultation, and the thyroiditis was managed symptomatically with Propranolol.

thyroiditis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute thyroiditis mimicking dental abscess
  presenting_complaint: Severe jaw and ear pain.
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old female spent a week undergoing dental investigations for suspected molar sepsis before a GP noted a tender anterior neck. Bloods revealed a TSH of 0.01 mIU/L and an ESR of 95 mm/hr. The diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis was made, and her "dental" pain vanished within 48 hours of starting Prednisolone.

thyroiditis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Hashimoto's thyroiditis with Polyglandular Autoimmune Syndrome Type 2
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue, skin hyperpigmentation, and weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female with known Hashimoto's thyroiditis presented with worsening exhaustion and new-onset syncopal episodes. Investigations confirmed concomitant Addison's disease with low morning cortisol and high ACTH. She required urgent steroid replacement before increasing her Levothyroxine dose to avoid precipitating an adrenal crisis.

thyroiditis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic thyroiditis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden exacerbation of neck pain in a patient with known Hashimoto's.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female with established autoimmune hypothyroidism presented with acute, localised thyroid pain and fever. While initially suspected to be a viral subacute thyroiditis, ultrasound revealed a rapidly expanding haemorrhagic cyst within a chronic Hashimoto's gland. Fine-needle aspiration provided symptomatic relief by draining the old blood.

thyroiditis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute thyroiditis with transient atrial fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Irregular heart rhythm and anterior neck ache.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male presented to A&E with new-onset atrial fibrillation and a heart rate of 130 bpm. He reported a "sore throat" that had moved down his neck over the last week. Thyroid function tests showed thyrotoxicosis, and he was diagnosed with De Quervain's thyroiditis; sinus rhythm was restored following Beta-blockade and NSAID therapy.

thyroiditis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Hashimoto's thyroiditis in Down's Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Slowing of growth and increased sleepiness.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy with Down's Syndrome was found to have a TSH of 45 mIU/L during annual screening. He had a palpable, firm goitre and positive anti-TPO antibodies. Levothyroxine was initiated at a low dose and titrated up, resulting in improved energy levels and a return to his previous growth velocity.

thyroiditis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Palpation-induced thyroiditis (Multifocal)
  presenting_complaint: Mild palpitations following a traumatic medical examination.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male developed transient hyperthyroid symptoms after vigorous and repeated palpation of his neck by multiple medical students during a teaching session. Biochemistry showed a mild rise in free T4 and suppressed TSH, which resolved spontaneously within two weeks. This rare "mechanically induced" thyroiditis required no specific treatment.

thyroiditis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute thyroiditis with prolonged hypothyroid phase
  presenting_complaint: Profound depression and myalgia following a resolved neck pain episode.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old female had a classic episode of De Quervain's thyroiditis that was treated with Ibuprofen. However, instead of returning to euthyroidism, she developed severe hypothyroidism with a TSH of 80 mIU/L lasting over six months. She required temporary Levothyroxine replacement for nearly a year before her thyroid gland recovered sufficient function to maintain euthyroidism.
