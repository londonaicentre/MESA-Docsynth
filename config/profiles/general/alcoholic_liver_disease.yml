alcoholic_liver_disease_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic fatty liver disease (steatosis)
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of raised transaminases and hepatomegaly.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male presented to his GP for a routine health check. Bloods revealed ALT 85 U/L and GGT 210 U/L with an MCV of 102 fL. Ultrasound confirmed diffuse increased echogenicity of the liver parenchyma consistent with steatosis. He was advised on alcohol abstinence and referred to community alcohol services for his 50 units/week intake.

alcoholic_liver_disease_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe acute alcoholic hepatitis
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice, abdominal pain, and anorexia.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female with a history of heavy spirit intake presented with a two-week history of worsening icterus. Examination showed tender hepatomegaly and a Maddrey’s Discriminant Function score of 42. She was started on IV Pabrinex and oral prednisolone 40mg daily after sepsis was excluded. Her bilirubin improved over 7 days, and she was discharged with a plan for intensive addiction support.

alcoholic_liver_disease_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites
  presenting_complaint: Increasing abdominal girth and bilateral ankle oedema.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with chronic alcohol dependence presented with clinical ascites and peripheral oedema. Diagnostic paracentesis ruled out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), showing a SAAG of 14 g/L. He was commenced on spironolactone 100mg and furosemide 40mg, alongside a low-salt diet. His symptoms improved, and he was enrolled in a six-monthly HCC surveillance programme with US and AFP.

alcoholic_liver_disease_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF)
  presenting_complaint: Haematemesis and altered mental state.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with known ALD was admitted to the ICU following a massive variceal haemorrhage. Despite successful endoscopic band ligation, he developed Grade 3 hepatic encephalopathy and acute kidney injury (AKI). He required intubation, vasopressor support, and continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVH). His condition stabilised after 10 days, but he remains at high risk for further decompensation.

alcoholic_liver_disease_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic cirrhosis with Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP)
  presenting_complaint: Fever, diffuse abdominal pain, and confusion.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female with long-standing ALD presented with a temperature of 38.5°C and rigors. Ascitic fluid analysis revealed a neutrophil count of 450 cells/mm³, confirming SBP. She was treated with IV cefotaxime and 20% human albumin solution to prevent hepatorenal syndrome. Culture grew E. coli, and she completed a 7-day course of antibiotics with resolution of symptoms.

alcoholic_liver_disease_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) type 1
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly declining urine output and rising creatinine.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male with decompensated ALD and refractory ascites was admitted with a creatinine of 240 μmol/L. Despite fluid resuscitation and withdrawal of diuretics, renal function worsened. He was diagnosed with HRS and commenced on terlipressin infusion and albumin. He showed a partial response, with creatinine stabilising at 160 μmol/L, and was subsequently assessed for liver transplantation.

alcoholic_liver_disease_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic alcoholic liver disease with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and profound memory deficits.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with a 30-year history of alcohol misuse was brought to A&E by police. Examination revealed nystagmus, gait instability, and confabulation. He was treated with high-dose IV Pabrinex (thiamine) for 3 days. While the ataxia improved slightly, he was left with permanent short-term memory impairment requiring long-term residential care.

alcoholic_liver_disease_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic liver disease with Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE)
  presenting_complaint: Reversal of sleep-wake cycle and flapping tremor.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female was brought to the outpatient clinic by her daughter due to increasing forgetfulness and daytime somnolence. She demonstrated a clear asterixis on examination. Ammonia levels were elevated at 90 μmol/L. She was prescribed lactulose and rifaximin 550mg BD, which led to a significant improvement in her cognitive function within two weeks.

alcoholic_liver_disease_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Compensated alcoholic cirrhosis
  presenting_complaint: Generalised pruritus and spider naevi.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented with persistent itching. Examination revealed multiple spider naevi on the chest and palmar erythema. FibroScan showed a liver stiffness of 18.5 kPa, consistent with F4 fibrosis. He had no history of decompensation (ascites or bleeds). He achieved total abstinence through a local support group, and his LFTs normalised over 12 months, although cirrhosis remains.

alcoholic_liver_disease_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic liver disease with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss and right upper quadrant dull ache.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with a history of heavy drinking presented with 10kg weight loss. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was 450 ng/mL, and a triple-phase CT scan showed a 4cm hypervascular lesion in segment VII with venous washout. Due to his Child-Pugh B status and the lesion size, he was referred for transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) rather than resection.

alcoholic_liver_disease_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe alcoholic hepatitis with steroid failure
  presenting_complaint: Deep jaundice and progressive liver failure.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female was admitted with acute alcoholic hepatitis and a Lille score of 0.52 on day 7 of prednisolone, indicating steroid non-response. Prednisolone was discontinued to reduce infection risk. She was managed supportively with enteral nutrition but unfortunately developed multi-organ failure and died three weeks after admission.

alcoholic_liver_disease_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic liver disease in an adolescent
  presenting_complaint: Nausea, vomiting, and RUQ pain.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with a history of severe binge drinking since age 14 presented with acute hepatitis. Investigations showed ALT 400 U/L, AST 900 U/L (ratio >2), and biopsy confirmed steatohepatitis with early bridging fibrosis. He was referred to a specialist youth addiction service and started on a nutritional rehabilitation programme, showing significant biochemical improvement after 6 months of sobriety.

alcoholic_liver_disease_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic liver disease with secondary iron overload
  presenting_complaint: Hyperpigmentation and lethargy.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with known ALD had a ferritin of 1500 μg/L and transferrin saturation of 65%. Genetic testing for HFE mutations was negative. Liver biopsy showed grade 3 siderosis alongside alcoholic cirrhosis, likely due to chronic haemolysis and the effect of alcohol on hepcidin. He was managed with alcohol cessation, which led to a gradual decrease in ferritin levels without the need for venesection.

alcoholic_liver_disease_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory ascites in alcoholic cirrhosis
  presenting_complaint: Tense ascites requiring frequent drainage.
  summary_of_course: A 56-year-old female required large-volume paracentesis (LVP) every 2 weeks despite maximal diuretics. She underwent evaluation for a Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS). Following the procedure, her ascites became manageable with low-dose diuretics, though she required close monitoring for post-TIPS encephalopathy.

alcoholic_liver_disease_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic liver disease with portal hypertensive gastropathy
  presenting_complaint: Chronic iron-deficiency anaemia and melaena.
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old male with ALD presented with haemoglobin of 7.2 g/dL. Gastroscopy showed a "snake-skin" appearance of the gastric mucosa consistent with portal hypertensive gastropathy, with no discrete varices. He was treated with carvedilol to reduce portal pressure and oral iron supplements. His Hb stabilised at 10.5 g/dL over the following months.

alcoholic_liver_disease_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic liver disease with Zieve’s Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice, abdominal pain, and dark urine.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male presented with heavy alcohol intake, jaundice, and anaemia. Labs showed hyperlipidaemia, haemolytic anaemia (raised LDH, low haptoglobin), and alcoholic hepatitis. This triad confirmed Zieve’s Syndrome. With alcohol withdrawal and supportive care, his lipid profile and haemolysis resolved within two weeks.

alcoholic_liver_disease_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic liver disease with concurrent Hepatitis C
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue and abnormal liver enzymes.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male with a history of heavy drinking and past IV drug use was found to have cirrhosis. Screening revealed Hep C genotype 1a. He was treated with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) while attending an alcohol relapse prevention programme. He achieved a sustained virologic response (SVR), and his FibroScan score improved from 25 kPa to 15 kPa.

alcoholic_liver_disease_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic cardiomyopathy and cirrhosis
  presenting_complaint: Dyspnoea on exertion and orthopnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 53-year-old male with long-term ALD presented with signs of congestive heart failure. Echocardiogram showed a dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 30%. He was diagnosed with alcoholic cardiomyopathy alongside his liver disease. Management involved strict alcohol abstinence, ACE inhibitors, and beta-blockers, leading to a modest improvement in cardiac function.

alcoholic_liver_disease_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic liver disease with severe sarcopenia
  presenting_complaint: Profound muscle wasting and falls.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis presented with recurrent falls. CT imaging at the L3 level confirmed severe sarcopenia. He was started on a high-protein, high-calorie diet with late-evening snacks to prevent muscle catabolism. Physiotherapy and nutritional support improved his frailty score, making him a better candidate for potential future interventions.

alcoholic_liver_disease_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Cholestatic variant of alcoholic hepatitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe jaundice and intractable pruritus.
  summary_of_course: A 46-year-old female presented with a bilirubin of 450 μmol/L and high alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Imaging showed no biliary obstruction. Liver biopsy confirmed alcoholic hepatitis with prominent canalicular cholestasis. She required treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid and cholestyramine for symptom control, with a very slow resolution of jaundice over three months of abstinence.
