pulmonary_insufficiency_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Severe Pulmonary Insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Progressive exertional dyspnoea and reduced exercise tolerance.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot repair in infancy presented for routine follow-up. Cardiac MRI revealed severe pulmonary regurgitation with a regurgitant fraction of 45% and significant right ventricular (RV) dilatation (EDVi 160ml/m2). He underwent elective surgical pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) with a bioprosthetic valve, resulting in immediate improvement in haemodynamics and functional capacity.

pulmonary_insufficiency_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Infective Endocarditis with Severe Pulmonary Insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: High-grade fever, rigors, and pleuritic chest pain.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female with a history of intravenous drug use presented to A&E with sepsis. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) identified large, mobile vegetations on the pulmonary valve leaflets causing acute, severe pulmonary insufficiency and multiple septic pulmonary emboli. She was commenced on intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone, eventually requiring emergency valve debridement and repair due to refractory heart failure.

pulmonary_insufficiency_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Functional Pulmonary Insufficiency secondary to Pulmonary Hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Worsening peripheral oedema and abdominal bloating.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male with Group 3 pulmonary hypertension (COPD-related) presented with signs of right-sided heart failure. Investigation showed a dilated pulmonary artery (42mm) and a high-velocity Graham Steell murmur, confirmed as moderate functional pulmonary insufficiency on Doppler. Management focused on optimizing long-term oxygen therapy and diuretic titration, which partially alleviated the regurgitant volume.

pulmonary_insufficiency_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Isolated Congenital Pulmonary Insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of a diastolic murmur during a school physical.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy was referred to paediatric cardiology after a soft, decrescendo diastolic murmur was heard at the left upper sternal edge. Echo confirmed mild congenital pulmonary valve insufficiency with normal RV size and function. No intervention was required, and the patient remains asymptomatic under biennial outpatient surveillance.

pulmonary_insufficiency_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-Valvuloplasty Pulmonary Insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Routine post-procedural monitoring.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old female underwent balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty for severe pulmonary stenosis. Post-procedure TTE demonstrated successful relief of the gradient but documented a new moderate pulmonary insufficiency due to leaflet tearing. She remains clinically stable with no RV dilatation at 12 months, though she requires lifelong monitoring for potential late-stage RV failure.

pulmonary_insufficiency_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Carcinoid Heart Disease with Pulmonary Insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Episodic flushing, diarrhoea, and new-onset breathlessness.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female with a known metastatic midgut carcinoid tumour presented with NYHA Class III symptoms. Echocardiography showed characteristic retracted, thickened pulmonary valve leaflets causing severe pulmonary insufficiency and concomitant stenosis. She was managed with somatostatin analogues and eventually referred for triple valve replacement (pulmonary, tricuspid, and mitral).

pulmonary_insufficiency_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Rheumatic Pulmonary Insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue and exertional palpitations.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male, recently migrated from a region with endemic rheumatic fever, presented with multisystem valvular disease. While mitral and aortic lesions predominated, Echo also revealed chronic rheumatic changes to the pulmonary valve resulting in moderate insufficiency. He was started on secondary penicillin prophylaxis and diuretics, with a plan for multi-valve surgery.

pulmonary_insufficiency_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic Acute Pulmonary Insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Sudden hypotension and hypoxia post-cardiac surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male underwent a Ross procedure for aortic valve disease. In the immediate post-operative period, he developed acute haemodynamic instability; a transoesophageal echo (TOE) revealed a dehiscence of the pulmonary homograft suture line causing massive pulmonary insufficiency. He was returned to theatre for urgent revision of the graft, leading to a successful recovery.

pulmonary_insufficiency_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Pulmonary Insufficiency secondary to Idiopathic Dilatation of the Pulmonary Artery
  presenting_complaint: Atypical chest pain and anxiety.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female was investigated for chest pain; CT pulmonary angiogram showed an idiopathic dilatation of the pulmonary trunk (38mm). Echocardiography confirmed mild pulmonary insufficiency (functional) with no evidence of pulmonary hypertension or intracardiac shunts. Reassurance was provided, and she was discharged from the clinic with no further treatment required.

pulmonary_insufficiency_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening Pulmonary Insufficiency with Refractory RV Failure
  presenting_complaint: Severe orthopnoea, anasarca, and jaundice.
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old female with long-standing severe pulmonary insufficiency and tricuspid regurgitation presented in extremis. Investigations showed "free" pulmonary regurgitation, a massively dilated RV, and secondary hepatic congestion (cardiac cirrhosis). Due to her frailty and multiple comorbidities, she was deemed high-risk for surgery and was managed with intensive intravenous diuretics and palliative care involvement.

pulmonary_insufficiency_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Traumatic Pulmonary Valve Rupture
  presenting_complaint: Acute chest pain and respiratory distress following a road traffic accident.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male sustained blunt chest trauma against a steering wheel. Initial trauma CT showed no aortic dissection, but persistent hypoxia prompted a TOE, which revealed a traumatic rupture of a pulmonary valve cusp and acute severe pulmonary insufficiency. He underwent successful primary repair of the valve leaflet via a median sternotomy.

pulmonary_insufficiency_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Pulmonary Insufficiency in Takayasu Arteritis
  presenting_complaint: Malaise, night sweats, and exertional dyspnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old female with Takayasu arteritis presented with systemic inflammation and new cardiac symptoms. Imaging revealed significant inflammation of the pulmonary artery (pulmonary arteritis) leading to annular dilatation and moderate pulmonary insufficiency. Symptoms improved significantly following high-dose corticosteroid therapy and methotrexate, which stabilized the arterial dimensions.

pulmonary_insufficiency_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Pulmonary Insufficiency in Marfan Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Routine cardiac screening for Marfan syndrome.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with Marfan syndrome was found to have a dilated pulmonary artery root (40mm) alongside his known aortic root dilatation. Doppler echo demonstrated moderate pulmonary insufficiency due to annular stretching. He was commenced on Losartan to mitigate TGF-beta signalling and is monitored annually for progression of both aortic and pulmonary root ectasia.

pulmonary_insufficiency_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Pulmonary Insufficiency with Cor Pulmonale
  presenting_complaint: Worsening leg swelling and blue lips (cyanosis).
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with severe obstructive sleep apnoea and obesity hypoventilation syndrome presented with decompensated cor pulmonale. Severe pulmonary hypertension had led to secondary pulmonary insufficiency and massive tricuspid regurgitation. Treatment with nocturnal CPAP, long-term oxygen, and aggressive diuresis led to a moderate reduction in pulmonary pressures and regurgitant severity.

pulmonary_insufficiency_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Pregnancy-related Exacerbation of Pulmonary Insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Significant breathlessness at 28 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female with a history of repaired Fallot's and baseline moderate pulmonary insufficiency presented with NYHA Class III symptoms during her third trimester. The physiological increase in blood volume exacerbated the RV volume overload and PI severity. She was managed with bed rest, low-dose furosemide, and early induction at 37 weeks, with a planned PVR six months postpartum.

pulmonary_insufficiency_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute Pulmonary Insufficiency due to Calcified Homograft Failure
  presenting_complaint: Gradual decline in exercise capacity over 2 years.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy, who had a Rastelli procedure in infancy, presented with signs of conduit failure. Imaging showed a heavily calcified pulmonary homograft with both severe stenosis and severe pulmonary insufficiency. He successfully underwent a percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation (PPVI) using a Melody valve, which restored valve competence and resolved his symptoms.

pulmonary_insufficiency_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic Pulmonary Insufficiency triggered by Pulmonary Embolism
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset pleuritic pain and syncope.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with pre-existing mild pulmonary insufficiency presented with an acute massive pulmonary embolism (PE). The sudden rise in pulmonary vascular resistance caused acute RV distension, worsening the pre-existing PI to a severe level. Following successful thrombolysis with alteplase, the pulmonary pressures dropped, and the PI returned to its mild baseline state.

pulmonary_insufficiency_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Trace Pulmonary Insufficiency (Physiological)
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding during pre-participation athlete screening.
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old professional footballer underwent a mandatory screening echocardiogram. A trace amount of pulmonary regurgitation was detected by colour Doppler, which is a common physiological finding in healthy individuals. The RV dimensions, wall thickness, and function were entirely normal, and he was cleared for all competitive sports without restrictions.

pulmonary_insufficiency_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Pulmonary Insufficiency post-Lecompte Manoeuvre
  presenting_complaint: Follow-up for Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA).
  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old girl who underwent an arterial switch operation with a Lecompte manoeuvre for TGA was found to have moderate pulmonary insufficiency. The regurgitation was attributed to the stretching of the neo-pulmonary valve and the altered geometry of the pulmonary arteries. She remains asymptomatic, but cardiac MRI is scheduled to monitor RV volumes as she grows.

pulmonary_insufficiency_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Failed Bioprosthetic Pulmonary Valve Insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent palpitations and fatigue.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female who had a bioprosthetic PVR ten years ago presented with valve degeneration. Echo showed significant leaflet thickening and severe "pin-hole" regurgitation (severe pulmonary insufficiency). Due to the high risk of a third sternotomy, she was successfully treated with a valve-in-valve transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR), with excellent immediate results.
