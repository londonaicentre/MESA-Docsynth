encephalopathy_unspecified_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute unspecified encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Acute confusion and fluctuating consciousness
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female presented to A&E with a 24-hour history of disorientation and visual hallucinations. Initial investigations for urinary tract infection and electrolyte imbalance were inconclusive, with a GCS of 13/15. She was managed with intravenous fluids and supportive care, showing gradual cognitive improvement over five days.

encephalopathy_unspecified_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe metabolic encephalopathy, unspecified
  presenting_complaint: Deepening coma and respiratory depression
  summary_of_course: A 4-month-old infant was admitted to the paediatric ITU following a three-day history of poor feeding and progressive lethargy. Extensive screening for inborn errors of metabolism and viral encephalitis returned negative results, yet the patient remained obtunded. Treatment involved mechanical ventilation and empirical metabolic support, with a slow neurological recovery over two weeks.

encephalopathy_unspecified_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute encephalopathy, cause undetermined
  presenting_complaint: Progressive cognitive decline and personality changes
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with stage 4 chronic kidney disease presented with a two-week history of worsening memory and irritability. Despite stable renal function and unremarkable MRI head, his mental state continued to deteriorate, necessitating admission. He was treated empirically for possible uremic toxins despite near-normal urea levels, resulting in partial symptomatic relief.

encephalopathy_unspecified_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of baseline confusion and agitation
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female with known vascular dementia was brought to hospital after becoming acutely non-verbal and aggressive. Blood tests showed mild dehydration but no evidence of acute infection or stroke on CT. The episode was classified as an unspecified encephalopathic crisis, managed with low-dose antipsychotics and rehydration.

encephalopathy_unspecified_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening unspecified encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Status epilepticus followed by prolonged coma
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male was admitted via ambulance after a prolonged tonic-clonic seizure that transitioned into a non-responsive state. EEG showed generalised slowing without further seizure activity, and toxicology was negative. He remained in a vegetative state for ten days in ICU before slowly regaining consciousness, with the underlying trigger remaining unidentified.

encephalopathy_unspecified_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic mild encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Persistent "brain fog" and impaired executive function
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female reported six months of cognitive slowing following a severe bout of pneumonia. Neuropsychological testing confirmed deficits in attention and processing speed, though neuroimaging and lumbar puncture were normal. She was managed in an outpatient setting with cognitive rehabilitation for persistent post-illness encephalopathy.

  primary_diagnosis: Acute encephalopathy following trauma
  presenting_complaint: Disorientation and repetitive questioning post-fall
  summary_of_course: An 89-year-old male was admitted after a mechanical fall with no evidence of intracranial haemorrhage on CT. He remained significantly confused and unable to form new memories for 72 hours despite normal obs and biochemistry. The diagnosis of unspecified post-traumatic encephalopathy was made, and he was discharged to a rehabilitation facility.

encephalopathy_unspecified_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute paediatric encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Loss of developmental milestones and ataxia
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old girl presented with a three-week history of regressing language skills and unsteady gait. Extensive genetic and autoimmune panels were negative, and EEG showed non-specific background slowing. She was treated with a trial of intravenous immunoglobulins for suspected but unconfirmed neuro-inflammation, resulting in stabilisation of symptoms.

encephalopathy_unspecified_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe encephalopathy in multi-organ failure
  presenting_complaint: Failure to wake following sedation holiday
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male in the ITU for septic shock and renal failure failed to regain consciousness after sedation was discontinued. MRI and CSF studies were unremarkable, and metabolic parameters were being corrected via filtration. The patient was diagnosed with unspecified encephalopathy of critical illness, with neurological recovery lagging behind organ system improvement.

encephalopathy_unspecified_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild acute encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Disproportionate confusion and lethargy
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old female presented with mild hyponatraemia (131 mmol/L) but exhibited severe delirium and inability to recognise family members. The degree of cognitive impairment was deemed out of proportion to the electrolyte derangement. Her mental state improved rapidly upon gentle fluid restriction, though the specific encephalopathic trigger remained unclear.

encephalopathy_unspecified_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, unspecified
  presenting_complaint: Acute agitation and autonomic instability
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male was brought to A&E by police in a highly agitated, delirious state with tachycardia and pyrexia. Comprehensive toxicology screens for common drugs of abuse and medication overdoses were negative. He required sedation and intubation for management of acute encephalopathy, with symptoms resolving spontaneously over 48 hours.

encephalopathy_unspecified_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening hepatic-like encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Grade IV coma and asterixis
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with compensated cirrhosis presented with sudden onset deep coma. Interestingly, his ammonia levels and liver function tests were near baseline, and there was no evidence of GI bleed or infection. He was treated aggressively for encephalopathy with lactulose and rifaximin, showing a rapid but unexplained neurological recovery.

encephalopathy_unspecified_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute unspecified encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Subtle personality changes and social withdrawal
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old female was referred by her GP for a two-month history of apathy and neglect of personal hygiene. Initial screening for common dementias was inconclusive, and MRI showed only age-related changes. She was admitted for observation of a subacute encephalopathic process, with symptoms partially responding to nutritional supplementation.

encephalopathy_unspecified_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Neonatal encephalopathy, unspecified
  presenting_complaint: Irritability, poor suck, and high-pitched cry
  summary_of_course: A 2-week-old neonate was readmitted with signs of neurological distress and abnormal posturing. Sepsis was ruled out via lumbar puncture and blood cultures, and birth history was unremarkable for hypoxia. The infant was diagnosed with unspecified neonatal encephalopathy and monitored closely, with symptoms resolving by one month of age.

encephalopathy_unspecified_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate post-cardiac arrest encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Delayed neurological recovery post-resuscitation
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male was resuscitated from a ventricular fibrillation arrest with a short down-time. Despite early return of spontaneous circulation, he remained in a state of moderate encephalopathy with GCS 10/15 for several days. Neuroprognostication was difficult due to the lack of focal findings, but he eventually made a full recovery.

encephalopathy_unspecified_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe acute encephalopathy in polypharmacy
  presenting_complaint: Somnolence and pinpoint pupils
  summary_of_course: An 81-year-old female with multiple comorbidities was found non-responsive at home. While opioid toxicity was suspected, naloxone provided no improvement, and renal function was only mildly impaired. She was diagnosed with an unspecified encephalopathy likely secondary to complex drug-drug interactions, requiring a week of inpatient monitoring.

encephalopathy_unspecified_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute progressive encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Progressive obtundation and myoclonic jerks
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female presented with a six-week history of worsening consciousness and involuntary muscle twitches. Paraneoplastic and autoimmune screens were negative, and CJD was excluded via protein 14-3-3 testing. The patient was diagnosed with an unspecified progressive encephalopathy and provided with palliative support as her condition declined.

encephalopathy_unspecified_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild acute encephalopathy in a young adult
  presenting_complaint: Disorientation and headache post-viral illness
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male presented with persistent disorientation and inability to concentrate following a mild upper respiratory tract infection. Neurological examination was normal, but he failed basic bedside cognitive screening. He was diagnosed with a mild post-viral encephalopathy and advised on a phased return to university.

encephalopathy_unspecified_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening non-convulsive encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive mutism and stupor
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old male was admitted after becoming suddenly mute and immobile over six hours. EEG demonstrated diffuse triphasic waves, but the patient had no history of hepatic or renal failure. He was treated for unspecified metabolic encephalopathy with aggressive hydration, but unfortunately passed away due to secondary pneumonia.

encephalopathy_unspecified_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe chronic encephalopathy in HIV
  presenting_complaint: Global cognitive impairment and incontinence
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male with poorly controlled HIV presented with a three-month history of severe cognitive decline. Investigations for PML, toxoplasmosis, and cryptococcus were negative, and CD4 count was moderately low. He was diagnosed with an unspecified HIV-associated encephalopathy and started on optimised antiretroviral therapy with slow improvement.
