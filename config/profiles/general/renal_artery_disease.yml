renal_artery_disease_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Atherosclerotic Renal Artery Stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Resistant hypertension and worsening renal function
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male smoker with peripheral vascular disease presented with a blood pressure of 190/110 mmHg despite four antihypertensive agents. Investigations revealed a serum creatinine of 185 µmol/L and a renal ultrasound showing a 2cm size discrepancy between kidneys. MR Angiography confirmed 85% ostial stenosis of the right renal artery, which was treated with percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty and stenting, resulting in improved BP control.

renal_artery_disease_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Fibromuscular Dysplasia
  presenting_complaint: Persistent headaches and incidental high blood pressure
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female presented to her GP with recurrent tension-type headaches; physical examination revealed a right-sided abdominal bruit and BP of 165/95 mmHg. Digital subtraction angiography demonstrated the classic "string-of-beads" appearance in the mid-to-distal right renal artery. She underwent successful balloon angioplasty without stenting, leading to complete resolution of hypertension and symptoms.

renal_artery_disease_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Renal Artery Embolism
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset severe left flank pain and nausea
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with known atrial fibrillation and poor anticoagulation compliance presented to the A&E with acute, colicky left-sided pain mimicking nephrolithiasis. Urinalysis showed microscopic haematuria, but CT KUB was negative for stones; however, a contrast-enhanced CT showed a wedge-shaped perfusion defect in the left kidney. He was started on intravenous heparin and transitioned to apixaban, with gradual recovery of renal function.

renal_artery_disease_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Pickering Syndrome (Flash Pulmonary Oedema)
  presenting_complaint: Acute shortness of breath and hypertensive urgency
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old female with known ischaemic heart disease presented with three episodes of sudden-onset pulmonary oedema over two months. Despite a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, bilateral renal artery stenosis was suspected and confirmed by Doppler ultrasound showing peak systolic velocities >350 cm/s. Bilateral renal artery stenting was performed to prevent recurrent "flash" pulmonary oedema, with no further admissions at six-month follow-up.

renal_artery_disease_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Spontaneous Renal Artery Dissection
  presenting_complaint: Sharp epigastric pain radiating to the back
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male marathon runner presented with acute abdominal pain following a long-distance race. CT Angiography revealed an intimal flap and a false lumen in the left renal artery extending to the segmental branches. Given the stable haemodynamics and absence of severe ischaemia, he was managed conservatively with strict BP control and antiplatelet therapy.

renal_artery_disease_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Takayasu Arteritis
  presenting_complaint: Malaise, weight loss, and unequal limb pulses
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old woman of South Asian descent presented with systemic inflammatory symptoms and a BP of 170/100 mmHg in the right arm but 110/70 mmHg in the left. Imaging showed concentric wall thickening of the aorta and high-grade stenosis at the origin of both renal arteries. She was commenced on high-dose prednisolone and methotrexate, with subsequent endovascular intervention planned once inflammatory markers normalised.

renal_artery_disease_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Transplant Renal Artery Stenosis (TRAS)
  presenting_complaint: Rising creatinine and new-onset hypertension post-transplant
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male, six months post-deceased donor renal transplant, showed a progressive rise in serum creatinine from 120 to 210 µmol/L. An audible bruit was noted over the iliac fossa transplant site. Colour Doppler and subsequent angiography confirmed a 90% stenosis at the anastomotic site, which was successfully treated with balloon angioplasty, restoring baseline graft function.

renal_artery_disease_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Renal Artery Aneurysm
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding on CT for abdominal bloating
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female underwent a CT abdomen for unrelated gastrointestinal symptoms, which revealed a 2.8cm saccular aneurysm at the bifurcation of the right renal artery. Due to the size exceeding 2cm and the risk of rupture, she underwent elective endovascular coiling. Post-procedure imaging confirmed successful exclusion of the aneurysm with preserved distal renal perfusion.

renal_artery_disease_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Bilateral Renal Artery Stenosis with ACE-inhibitor induced AKI
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly declining renal function after starting Ramipril
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with generalised atherosclerosis was started on Ramipril 2.5mg for hypertension. Within one week, his creatinine rose from 115 µmol/L to 340 µmol/L, accompanied by hyperkalaemia. The ACE inhibitor was immediately ceased, and investigations confirmed high-grade bilateral renal artery stenosis; his renal function returned to baseline following drug withdrawal and subsequent vascular review.

renal_artery_disease_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Renal Artery Stenosis (Neurofibromatosis Type 1)
  presenting_complaint: Severe hypertension during a routine school check-up
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy with known Neurofibromatosis Type 1 was found to have a BP of 150/105 mmHg. Workup revealed high plasma renin activity and MRA showed a proximal narrowing of the left renal artery consistent with vascular involvement of NF1. He underwent a successful surgical aortorenal bypass using a saphenous vein graft, as the lesion was not amenable to angioplasty.

renal_artery_disease_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Renal Artery Thrombosis in Nephrotic Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Acute flank pain and oliguria
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female with biopsy-proven Minimal Change Disease and profound hypoalbuminaemia (18 g/L) presented with sudden left-sided pain. A CT angiogram demonstrated an acute thrombus in the main left renal artery. She was treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis and long-term anticoagulation, highlighting the hypercoagulable state associated with nephrotic-range proteinuria.

renal_artery_disease_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Ruptured Renal Artery Aneurysm in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Sudden collapse and severe abdominal pain in the third trimester
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant woman (34 weeks gestation) presented in haemorrhagic shock. Emergency laparotomy revealed a massive retroperitoneal haematoma from a ruptured right renal artery aneurysm. An emergency Caesarean section was performed followed by a right nephrectomy to control bleeding; both mother and infant survived after significant blood product resuscitation.

renal_artery_disease_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Ischaemic Nephropathy
  presenting_complaint: Progressive chronic kidney disease and small kidneys on US
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with a history of heavy smoking and stroke was noted to have a decline in eGFR from 45 to 20 mL/min/1.73m² over two years. Ultrasound showed the left kidney had shrunk to 7.2cm and the right to 8.5cm. Doppler studies confirmed chronic total occlusion of the left renal artery and 70% stenosis of the right, managed conservatively with medical optimisation given her frailty.

renal_artery_disease_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Segmental Renal Infarction due to Infective Endocarditis
  presenting_complaint: Fever, malaise, and left-sided pleuritic chest pain
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use presented with Staphylococcal endocarditis of the mitral valve. During admission, he developed acute left-sided abdominal pain and haematuria. CT imaging confirmed multiple small segmental renal infarcts caused by septic emboli from the valvular vegetations; he was treated with a prolonged course of intravenous flucloxacillin.

renal_artery_disease_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Atheroembolic Renal Disease (Cholesterol Embolisation)
  presenting_complaint: Livedo reticularis and AKI following coronary angiography
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male underwent a difficult cardiac catheterisation for angina. Two weeks later, he developed "blue toe syndrome," mottled skin on his thighs, and a rise in creatinine from 130 to 280 µmol/L. Eosinophilia was noted on the full blood count, and a skin biopsy confirmed cholesterol clefts, representing a complication of iatrogenic plaque disruption during the previous arterial procedure.

renal_artery_disease_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Multi-vessel Fibromuscular Dysplasia
  presenting_complaint: Tinnitus and hypertension
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old woman presented with pulsatile tinnitus and a BP of 160/100 mmHg. Imaging revealed beaded stenoses in both the internal carotid arteries and the right renal artery. She was managed with aspirin and Amlodipine, with regular surveillance imaging to monitor for progression or dissection in both vascular beds.

renal_artery_disease_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Total Occlusion of the Renal Artery
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding during workup for adrenal mass
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male underwent CT imaging for a suspected adrenal incidentaloma, which instead revealed a completely occluded left renal artery with extensive peri-pelvic collateral vessels. Despite the occlusion, the left kidney remained 9cm in length and the patient was normotensive with stable renal function. No intervention was indicated as the kidney was well-compensated by collateral flow.

renal_artery_disease_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Traumatic Renal Artery Thrombosis
  presenting_complaint: Blunt abdominal trauma following a motor vehicle accident
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male was involved in a high-speed collision with significant deceleration. He presented with gross haematuria and flank bruising. A trauma CT scan showed a "cold" non-enhancing right kidney, and angiography confirmed a traumatic intimal tear and thrombosis of the right renal artery. Due to a warm ischaemia time exceeding 4 hours, the kidney was non-salvageable and he was managed expectantly.

renal_artery_disease_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Renal Artery Pseudoaneurysm
  presenting_complaint: Post-operative haemorrhage and flank pain
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male underwent a robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy for a renal cell carcinoma. On post-operative day 5, he developed sudden-onset flank pain and a drop in haemoglobin from 110 to 75 g/L. An urgent CT angiogram identified a 1.5cm pseudoaneurysm arising from a segmental renal artery branch, which was successfully treated with super-selective micro-coil embolisation.

renal_artery_disease_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Solitary Kidney with Critical Renal Artery Stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly rising creatinine and fluid overload
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old female, who had a previous right nephrectomy for a tumour, presented with a creatinine of 450 µmol/L and clinical signs of uraemia. Urgent Doppler ultrasound of her solitary left kidney showed a peak systolic velocity of 450 cm/s at the renal artery origin. An emergency angioplasty and stenting were performed, resulting in a dramatic diuresis and a fall in creatinine to 140 µmol/L within 48 hours.
