hypocalcaemia_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute post-surgical hypocalcaemia
  presenting_complaint: Perioral tingling and carpopedal spasm
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented 48 hours after a total thyroidectomy for Graves' disease with worsening distal paraesthesia and a positive Chvostek’s sign. Investigations revealed a corrected calcium of 1.82 mmol/L and an undetectable parathyroid hormone level. She was treated with intravenous calcium gluconate followed by oral alfacalcidol and calcium carbonate, resulting in symptom resolution.

hypocalcaemia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Nutritional Vitamin D deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Generalised bone pain and proximal muscle weakness
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old housebound male presented with a three-month history of progressive mobility issues and diffuse musculoskeletal pain. Biochemistry showed a corrected calcium of 2.05 mmol/L, phosphate of 0.7 mmol/L, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 12 nmol/L. He was diagnosed with osteomalacia secondary to severe Vitamin D deficiency and commenced on high-dose colecalciferol loading.

hypocalcaemia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic idiopathic hypoparathyroidism
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent generalised tonic-clonic seizures
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old female with a history of "refractory epilepsy" was admitted following a cluster of seizures. CT head showed extensive basal ganglia calcification (Fahr’s syndrome), and bloods confirmed a corrected calcium of 1.58 mmol/L with an inappropriately low PTH of 0.8 pmol/L. Her neurological symptoms stabilised once calcium levels were corrected with long-term vitamin D analogues.

hypocalcaemia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute pancreatitis-associated hypocalcaemia
  presenting_complaint: Severe epigastric pain radiating to the back
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male was admitted with acute gallstone pancreatitis and a Glasgow score of 3. On day three, his corrected calcium dropped to 1.88 mmol/L, likely due to saponification of intraperitoneal fat. This was managed as part of his intensive care support with cautious electrolyte replacement, and levels normalised as the systemic inflammation subsided.

hypocalcaemia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Tumour Lysis Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Oliguria and muscle cramps following chemotherapy
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with Burkitt’s lymphoma developed acute kidney injury and muscle cramps 24 hours after initiating induction chemotherapy. Laboratory results showed hyperuricaemia, hyperkalaemia, hyperphosphataemia (3.2 mmol/L), and secondary hypocalcaemia (1.72 mmol/L). He required rasburicase and temporary haemodialysis in the ICU to manage the metabolic derangement.

hypocalcaemia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary hyperparathyroidism of renal origin
  presenting_complaint: Routine monitoring of chronic kidney disease
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with Stage 5 CKD on haemodialysis showed a persistent corrected calcium of 1.95 mmol/L and a phosphate of 2.1 mmol/L. Despite a very high PTH of 85 pmol/L, her calcium remained low due to calcitriol deficiency and skeletal resistance to PTH. Management involved optimizing phosphate binders and starting cinacalcet to balance the mineral bone disorder.

hypocalcaemia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Hungry Bone Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Profound weakness and numbness post-parathyroidectomy
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female underwent surgical excision of a large parathyroid adenoma for severe primary hyperparathyroidism (pre-op Ca 3.10 mmol/L). Post-operatively, her calcium plummeted to 1.65 mmol/L despite detectable PTH, accompanied by hypophosphataemia. This hungry bone syndrome required aggressive supplementation with high-dose oral calcium and vitamin D for several weeks.

hypocalcaemia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: DiGeorge Syndrome (22q11.2 deletion)
  presenting_complaint: Neonatal jitters and tetany
  summary_of_course: A 10-day-old neonate was referred for cardiology review due to a suspected Tetralogy of Fallot and was found to have twitching of the extremities. Investigations confirmed a serum calcium of 1.70 mmol/L and absent thymic shadow on chest X-ray. Genetic testing confirmed 22q11.2 deletion, and the infant was started on specialized neonatal calcium supplementation.

hypocalcaemia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Malabsorption-related hypocalcaemia
  presenting_complaint: Chronic diarrhoea and paraesthesia
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female with undiagnosed Coeliac disease presented with a six-month history of steatorrhoea and recent onset of hand numbness. Blood tests revealed a corrected calcium of 2.01 mmol/L, low magnesium, and positive anti-TTG antibodies. A gluten-free diet and fat-soluble vitamin supplementation led to the normalization of her calcium levels and resolution of gastrointestinal symptoms.

hypocalcaemia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Sepsis-induced hypocalcaemia
  presenting_complaint: Hypotension and altered mental status
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male was admitted to the ICU with urosepsis and septic shock. His ionised calcium was measured at 0.82 mmol/L (normal 1.15-1.35), contributing to myocardial depression and poor vasopressor response. He received titrated intravenous calcium chloride infusions, which improved his haemodynamic stability during the acute phase of his illness.

hypocalcaemia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Denosumab-induced hypocalcaemia
  presenting_complaint: Severe lethargy and leg cramps
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with osteoporosis and impaired renal function (eGFR 28) received her first dose of Denosumab. Two weeks later, she presented with a corrected calcium of 1.52 mmol/L and symptomatic tetany. She required a five-day hospital admission for intravenous calcium replacement and high-dose oral vitamin D to counteract the potent antiresorptive effect.

hypocalcaemia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Citrate toxicity post-massive transfusion
  presenting_complaint: Prolonged QTc interval and hypotension during surgery
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male involved in a road traffic accident received 12 units of packed red cells and 8 units of FFP over two hours. During emergency laparotomy, the anaesthetist noted a prolonged QTc on the ECG and a drop in ionised calcium to 0.78 mmol/L due to citrate chelation. Boluses of calcium chloride were administered intraoperatively to maintain cardiac output.

hypocalcaemia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypomagnesaemia-induced hypocalcaemia
  presenting_complaint: Tremor and hyperreflexia
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with chronic alcohol dependence presented with withdrawal symptoms and significant neuromuscular irritability. Initial labs showed Ca 1.88 mmol/L and Mg 0.35 mmol/L; calcium supplementation alone failed to raise serum levels. Only after aggressive magnesium replacement was the functional hypoparathyroidism reversed, allowing the calcium levels to normalize.

hypocalcaemia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Pseudohypoparathyroidism Type 1a
  presenting_complaint: Short stature and round facies
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old girl presented with learning difficulties and physical features including brachydactyly (shortened 4th metacarpals). Biochemistry showed a low corrected calcium of 1.85 mmol/L and a markedly elevated PTH of 45 pmol/L, suggesting end-organ resistance to PTH. Genetic analysis confirmed a GNAS mutation, and she was started on alfacalcidol to manage her Albright’s Hereditary Osteodystrophy.

hypocalcaemia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcaemia (ADH)
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of low calcium
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male was found to have a corrected calcium of 1.98 mmol/L during routine insurance screening. Despite the low calcium, he was entirely asymptomatic with a low-normal PTH and high urinary calcium excretion (hypercalciuria). He was diagnosed with a gain-of-function mutation in the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) and managed conservatively to avoid nephrocalcinosis.

hypocalcaemia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Nutritional Rickets
  presenting_complaint: Delayed walking and bowing of the legs
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old boy of South Asian descent presented with visible genu varum and swelling of the wrists. Investigations showed a corrected calcium of 2.12 mmol/L, very low phosphate, and an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 1200 U/L. X-rays confirmed cupping and fraying of the metaphyses, and he was successfully treated with vitamin D3 and oral calcium.

hypocalcaemia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Cinacalcet-induced hypocalcaemia
  presenting_complaint: Muscle twitching and anxiety
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female with secondary hyperparathyroidism on haemodialysis was started on 30mg cinacalcet daily. One week later, she reported increased anxiety and "crawling" sensations in her skin; her calcium had dropped from 2.25 mmol/L to 1.89 mmol/L. The cinacalcet dose was reduced, and her oral calcium carbonate binder dose was increased to stabilize her levels.

hypocalcaemia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Osteoblastic metastases (Prostate Cancer)
  presenting_complaint: Worsening bone pain and fatigue
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer presented with increasing pelvic pain and a corrected calcium of 1.92 mmol/L. His ALP was significantly elevated at 850 U/L, suggesting high bone turnover and "calcium hunger" by the osteoblastic lesions. He was managed with palliative radiotherapy and oral calcium supplements to improve his systemic symptoms.

hypocalcaemia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Early-onset neonatal hypocalcaemia
  presenting_complaint: Jitteriness and poor feeding in a newborn
  summary_of_course: A 2-day-old infant born to a mother with poorly controlled gestational diabetes presented with irritability and exaggerated startle reflex. Serum calcium was 1.74 mmol/L. The condition was attributed to delayed PTH response and maternal hyperinsulinaemia; it resolved within 48 hours following increased frequency of breast milk feeding and a single dose of oral calcium.

hypocalcaemia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Hydrofluoric acid poisoning
  presenting_complaint: Severe finger pain following chemical exposure
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old industrial worker presented with excruciating pain in his right hand after a small spill of hydrofluoric acid. Despite the small surface area, he developed systemic toxicity with a corrected calcium of 1.45 mmol/L due to fluoride binding calcium ions. He required urgent intra-arterial calcium gluconate and intensive cardiac monitoring for life-threatening arrhythmias.
