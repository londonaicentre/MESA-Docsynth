Following a 48-hour period of monitoring and commencement of Labetalol, she underwent induction of labour at 37/40.

gestational_hypertension_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Late-onset gestational hypertension
  presenting_complaint: BP 158/102 mmHg at 38-week midwife appointment.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old healthy primigravida developed hypertension for the first time at 38/40. Blood results and urine PCR were normal, and she remained asymptomatic. Due to the term gestation, she was offered and accepted an induction of labour, which proceeded to a vaginal delivery without complications.

gestational_hypertension_008:
  primary_diagnosis: White coat hypertension in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Consistently high BP readings in clinic (155/95 mmHg).
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old at 22/40 gestation showed repeated clinic BP readings of 150-160/90-100 mmHg. Home BP monitoring (HBPM) and a 24-hour ambulatory BP monitor showed average readings of 122/78 mmHg. She was diagnosed with white coat hypertension and monitored with regular HBPM to ensure no progression to true gestational hypertension.

gestational_hypertension_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Resistant gestational hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Persistently high BP despite triple therapy at 33 weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old G1 at 33/40 remained hypertensive (165/105 mmHg) despite maximum doses of Labetalol, Nifedipine, and Methyldopa. Extensive workup found no evidence of pre-eclampsia or secondary causes. Due to the difficulty in achieving BP control, she was admitted for inpatient monitoring and delivered via CS at 34/40.

gestational_hypertension_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Gestational hypertension with fetal growth restriction
  presenting_complaint: Small for gestational age (SGA) fetus on scan at 31 weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old at 31/40 was found to have an estimated fetal weight <10th centile and maternal BP of 148/94 mmHg. Umbilical artery Dopplers showed increased resistance but positive end-diastolic flow. She was managed with Labetalol and twice-weekly CTGs, with delivery eventually indicated at 34/40 due to deteriorating fetal growth and maternal BP.

gestational_hypertension_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Gestational hypertension with placental abruption
  presenting_complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding at 34 weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old with untreated mild gestational hypertension (BP 145/95 at 32/40, defaulted follow-up) presented in extremis with a BP of 190/120 mmHg and woody-hard uterus. Diagnosis of placental abruption was made; emergency CS was performed under GA. Post-operatively, BP was managed with IV Hydralazine and later oral Labetalol.

gestational_hypertension_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute gestational hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Borderline BP readings over three community visits.
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old at 29/40 had BP readings fluctuating between 138/88 and 142/92 mmHg over two weeks. DAU assessment confirmed gestational hypertension (average 144/94 mmHg) with normal PCR. She was managed conservatively without medication but with increased frequency of monitoring, remaining stable until 40/40.

gestational_hypertension_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Gestational hypertension with comorbid Gestational Diabetes (GDM)
  presenting_complaint: Routine GDM clinic review at 28 weeks with BP 152/96 mmHg.
  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old with GDM (diet-controlled) was found to have new-onset hypertension at 28/40. Given the dual risk factors for pre-eclampsia, she was started on Labetalol and had weekly liver and renal function tests. BP remained well-controlled, and she underwent a planned IOL at 38/40.

gestational_hypertension_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Gestational hypertension in a remote setting
  presenting_complaint: Headache and BP 175/110 mmHg at 37 weeks in a rural clinic.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old living in a remote area presented late to a community clinic. Due to the severity of the BP and distance to the hospital, she received an initial dose of oral Nifedipine and was transferred via ambulance. Upon arrival, pre-eclampsia was excluded, and she was induced immediately due to term gestation and BP severity.

gestational_hypertension_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent gestational hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Early rise in BP at 20 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old G4P3 with a history of gestational hypertension in all previous pregnancies. BP rose to 150/95 mmHg at 20/40; she was already on Aspirin 150mg. Methyldopa was initiated early, and she was monitored with serial growth scans and uterine artery Dopplers, which remained normal throughout.

gestational_hypertension_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild gestational hypertension at term
  presenting_complaint: BP 142/92 mmHg at 39 weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old primigravida was found to be mildly hypertensive at her 39-week check. As she was at term and asymptomatic with no proteinuria, she was booked for induction of labour within 48 hours. She delivered a healthy 3.4kg infant vaginally, and her BP normalised within 24 hours postpartum.

gestational_hypertension_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Gestational hypertension progressing to HELLP syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Epigastric pain and vomiting at 32 weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old initially diagnosed with gestational hypertension at 30/40 (BP 150/95) presented two weeks later with severe epigastric pain. Bloods revealed ALT 450 U/L, LDH 800 U/L, and platelets 60 x 10^9/L, while BP was 165/110 mmHg. She was diagnosed with HELLP syndrome and underwent urgent delivery via CS after steroid administration.

gestational_hypertension_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Gestational hypertension with underlying IgA nephropathy
  presenting_complaint: Rising BP and stable proteinuria at 24 weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old with known IgA nephropathy (baseline PCR 40mg/mmol) presented with BP 155/98 mmHg. It was challenging to distinguish GH from renal flare, but stable PCR and normal serum urate suggested GH. She was managed by a joint obstetric-renal team with Nifedipine and delivered at 36/40.

gestational_hypertension_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Early-onset gestational hypertension
  presenting_complaint: BP 150/95 mmHg at 21 weeks.
  summary_of_course: An Afro-Caribbean patient, aged 26, presented with hypertension before 24/40 but after 20/40. Investigations for secondary causes of hypertension and pre-eclampsia were negative. She was started on Labetalol and required multiple dose adjustments, eventually requiring a second agent (Nifedipine) by 30/40 to maintain targets.

gestational_hypertension_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Masked gestational hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Normal clinic BP but high home readings at 31 weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old G2P1 reported home BP readings of 155/100 mmHg despite clinic readings of 130/80 mmHg. A 24-hour BP monitor confirmed masked hypertension with a daytime average of 148/96 mmHg. She was started on Labetalol 200mg BD and followed the standard gestational hypertension pathway for monitoring and delivery.
