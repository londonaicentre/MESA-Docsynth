hypertensive_encephalopathy_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute hypertensive encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Severe throbbing headache, nausea, and progressive confusion.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with known essential hypertension and poor medication adherence presented with a BP of 230/130 mmHg. Examination revealed grade III hypertensive retinopathy and a GCS of 13. CT head was clear of haemorrhage, but MRI brain confirmed vasogenic oedema in the posterior parieto-occipital regions. He was treated with a titrated IV labetalol infusion in the High Dependency Unit, resulting in gradual neurological recovery over 48 hours.

hypertensive_encephalopathy_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric hypertensive encephalopathy secondary to glomerulonephritis
  presenting_complaint: Generalised tonic-clonic seizure and vomiting.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old girl with recent streptococcal throat infection presented with sudden onset seizures and a BP of 160/105 mmHg. Urinalysis showed macroscopic haematuria and proteinuria, suggesting post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. She was managed with IV hydralazine and anticonvulsants, with BP stabilised and no further neurological deficits noted at follow-up.

hypertensive_encephalopathy_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Postpartum hypertensive encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Blurred vision, "flashing lights", and severe frontal headache.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old female, three days post-emergency caesarean section for pre-eclampsia, presented with worsening visual disturbances and a BP of 190/115 mmHg. Clinical assessment suggested a variant of eclampsia/hypertensive encephalopathy. She received IV magnesium sulphate prophylaxis and oral nifedipine, with rapid resolution of visual symptoms and BP control within 24 hours.

hypertensive_encephalopathy_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic hypertensive encephalopathy in ESRD
  presenting_complaint: Drowsiness and disorientation following missed dialysis sessions.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) presented with a BP of 215/125 mmHg after missing three dialysis sessions. He was fluid overloaded with pulmonary oedema and global cognitive impairment. Urgent haemodialysis was performed to remove fluid and toxins, alongside cautious BP management, leading to full restoration of baseline mental state.

hypertensive_encephalopathy_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Fulminant hypertensive encephalopathy secondary to phaeochromocytoma
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset "thunderclap" headache, palpitations, and subsequent coma.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with no prior history presented with a hypertensive crisis (BP 260/150 mmHg) and rapid decline to GCS 6. Initial CT showed diffuse cerebral oedema without focal lesions. Urinary catecholamines were significantly elevated, and a CT abdomen revealed a 5cm adrenal mass. She required ICU admission for alpha-blockade followed by beta-blockade and mechanical ventilation before eventual surgical resection.

hypertensive_encephalopathy_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Drug-induced acute hypertensive encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Extreme agitation, paranoia, and acute loss of vision.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male presented to A&E following heavy cocaine use with a BP of 245/140 mmHg. He exhibited signs of cortical blindness and severe psychomotor agitation. He was treated with IV diazepam for sedation and a glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) infusion to reduce systemic vascular resistance, with vision returning as BP normalised over 12 hours.

hypertensive_encephalopathy_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute hypertensive encephalopathy in the elderly
  presenting_complaint: Gradual cognitive decline and gait instability over two weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old female with long-standing, poorly controlled hypertension presented with what was initially suspected to be dementia. Her BP was consistently 200/110 mmHg in the clinic. MRI Brain showed extensive leukoaraiosis and signs of subacute PRES. Gradual introduction of amlodipine and ACE inhibitors led to a significant improvement in her MMSE score over one month.

hypertensive_encephalopathy_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypertensive encephalopathy presenting as Anton syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Visual loss with denial of blindness (confabulation).
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with a BP of 235/135 mmHg claimed he could see despite bumping into furniture and failing all bedside visual tests. MRI confirmed bilateral occipital vasogenic oedema characteristic of hypertensive encephalopathy. He was treated with IV nicardipine, and his visual awareness and acuity returned as the oedema resolved on follow-up imaging.

hypertensive_encephalopathy_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypertensive encephalopathy secondary to aortic coarctation
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent epistaxis, severe headache, and leg weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old boy presented with a BP of 195/110 mmHg in his right arm but significantly lower pressures in his legs. He was confused with bilateral papilloedema. Investigations confirmed a post-ductal coarctation of the aorta. He was stabilised with IV antihypertensives before undergoing successful surgical repair, with complete resolution of neurological symptoms.

hypertensive_encephalopathy_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Ciclosporin-induced hypertensive encephalopathy (PRES)
  presenting_complaint: New-onset seizures and altered consciousness.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old renal transplant recipient on ciclosporin presented with a BP of 170/100 mmHg and status epilepticus. Despite the BP not being "malignant," the neurotoxic effects of the calcineurin inhibitor lowered the threshold for encephalopathy. Ciclosporin was withheld, BP was lowered with labetalol, and he was switched to tacrolimus without further neurological recurrence.

hypertensive_encephalopathy_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe hypertensive encephalopathy with multi-organ failure
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath, chest pain, and obtundation.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented with a BP of 250/160 mmHg, acute pulmonary oedema, and acute kidney injury (creatinine 450 µmol/L). He was deeply somnolent with a GCS of 9. He required multi-modal therapy in the ICU including nitroprusside infusion and continuous veno-venous haemofiltration. He survived but was left with chronic kidney disease stage 4.

hypertensive_encephalopathy_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypertensive encephalopathy mimicking acute ischaemic stroke
  presenting_complaint: Right-sided weakness and expressive aphasia.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female presented with focal neurological signs and a BP of 220/120 mmHg. Thrombolysis was considered but deferred due to the extreme BP. MRI showed no restricted diffusion but instead showed reversible vasogenic oedema in the left hemisphere. BP reduction led to the total resolution of "stroke" symptoms within 6 hours, confirming a focal presentation of hypertensive encephalopathy.

hypertensive_encephalopathy_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory hypertensive encephalopathy secondary to renal artery stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent headache and vomiting despite triple antihypertensive therapy.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female with flash pulmonary oedema and encephalopathy was found to have a BP of 230/125 mmHg. Despite maximal doses of ramipril, bisoprolol, and amlodipine, her BP remained refractory. Renal artery duplex and subsequent MRA identified bilateral high-grade renal artery stenosis. She underwent renal artery stenting, which allowed for BP control and resolution of her neurological symptoms.

hypertensive_encephalopathy_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcohol withdrawal-associated hypertensive encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Tremor, hallucinations, and a BP of 210/115 mmHg.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male with chronic alcohol dependency presented in acute withdrawal. The sympathetic surge resulted in severe hypertension and a subsequent seizure followed by prolonged post-ictal confusion. While initially treated for Delirium Tremens, the persistence of papilloedema and MRI findings confirmed a secondary hypertensive encephalopathy. He was managed with benzodiazepines and IV labetalol.

hypertensive_encephalopathy_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-carotid endarterectomy hyperperfusion syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Severe hemicranial headache and focal seizures.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male underwent a left carotid endarterectomy for 95% stenosis. Post-operatively, his BP rose to 185/95 mmHg, and he developed a severe headache followed by right-sided twitching. This was diagnosed as hyperperfusion syndrome, a form of localised hypertensive encephalopathy due to impaired autoregulation. Intensive BP control to a systolic target of <140 mmHg prevented intracerebral haemorrhage.

hypertensive_encephalopathy_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypertensive encephalopathy in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, skin rash, and joint pain.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female with SLE and lupus nephritis presented with a BP of 190/110 mmHg and acute delirium. The clinical challenge was distinguishing between neuropsychiatric SLE and hypertensive encephalopathy. MRI showed classic posterior reversible changes, and her symptoms improved rapidly with BP control and pulsed methylprednisolone, suggesting a multifactorial aetiology involving both vasculitis and hypertension.

hypertensive_encephalopathy_017:
  primary_diagnosis: MAOI-Tyramine interaction (Hypertensive Crisis)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden "explosive" headache and neck stiffness after a meal.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male taking phenelzine (an MAOI) for depression presented with a BP of 240/145 mmHg after consuming aged cheese. He was confused and photophobic, mimicking subarachnoid haemorrhage. CT and LP were negative for blood. He was diagnosed with a "cheese reaction" leading to hypertensive encephalopathy and was treated with IV phentolamine, resulting in rapid symptom resolution.

hypertensive_complaint_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute hypertensive encephalopathy with personality change
  presenting_complaint: Worsening irritability, apathy, and executive dysfunction.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male was brought in by his family due to a one-week history of personality changes. His BP was 210/120 mmHg. He had no focal deficits but was profoundly disorientated to time. MRI revealed diffuse white matter oedema. Over a week of controlled BP reduction using oral agents in a ward setting, his cognitive function and personality returned to baseline.

hypertensive_encephalopathy_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Malignant hypertension with encephalopathy and papilloedema
  presenting_complaint: Blurred vision and "heavy" headache.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old heavy smoker presented with a BP of 250/140 mmHg. Fundoscopy revealed bilateral grade IV hypertensive retinopathy (papilloedema). He was confused and complained of nausea. He was started on an IV sodium nitroprusside infusion in the ICU with invasive arterial monitoring. His BP was reduced by 25% over the first 24 hours to avoid cerebral ischaemia, with visual acuity gradually improving.

hypertensive_encephalopathy_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Nocturnal hypertensive encephalopathy in autonomic failure
  presenting_complaint: Waking up with confusion and severe headache that improves during the day.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with Parkinson's disease and significant orthostatic hypotension was found to have severe supine hypertension (BP 210/110 mmHg at night). She experienced episodes of nocturnal confusion and morning headaches. 24-hour BP monitoring confirmed the diagnosis. Adjusting her medication to include a short-acting nocturnal antihypertensive and elevating the head of her bed resolved the encephalopathic symptoms.
