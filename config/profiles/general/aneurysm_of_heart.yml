aneurysm_of_heart_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic left ventricular aneurysm
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding on routine echocardiography
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with a history of an anterior STEMI five years ago underwent a routine follow-up echocardiogram. Imaging revealed a large, dyskinetic, thin-walled apical segment consistent with a chronic left ventricular (LV) aneurysm. He remains asymptomatic with an EF of 40%, and management focused on optimising ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker therapy.

aneurysm_of_heart_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute post-infarction pseudoaneurysm
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset chest pain and hypotension
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female presented seven days post-inferior MI with acute cardiogenic shock. Urgent bedside echo and CT pulmonary angiogram identified a pseudoaneurysm of the LV posterior wall with evidence of contained rupture. She was rushed to theatre for emergency surgical repair and survived following a prolonged ICU stay.

aneurysm_of_heart_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Left ventricular aneurysm with mural thrombus
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset right-sided weakness and aphasia
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male smoker presented with an ischaemic stroke; subsequent investigations identified a previously undiagnosed apical LV aneurysm. A large, pedunculated mural thrombus was visible within the aneurysmal sac on cardiac MRI. He was started on warfarin for anticoagulation alongside standard secondary prevention for coronary artery disease.

aneurysm_of_heart_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Congenital left ventricular diverticulum
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations and atypical chest pain
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female athlete was referred after an abnormal screening ECG showed T-wave inversions. Cardiac MRI identified a narrow-necked contractile outpouching at the LV apex, diagnostic of a congenital diverticulum rather than a true aneurysm. She remains under annual surveillance with no restrictions on activity as the lesion is small and asymptomatic.

aneurysm_of_heart_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory ventricular tachycardia secondary to LV aneurysm
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent syncope and palpitations
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male with a known ischaemic LV aneurysm presented with multiple episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). Despite amiodarone therapy, he required an ICD and eventually underwent surgical aneurysmectomy and endocardial resection to eliminate the arrhythmogenic focus. Post-operative recovery was stable with no further VT episodes.

aneurysm_of_heart_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Apical aneurysm in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive exertional dyspnoea
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female with known HCM presented with worsening NYHA Class III symptoms. Imaging confirmed an "hourglass" LV morphology with a distinct apical aneurysm and associated regional dyskinesia. Due to the high risk of thromboembolism and sudden cardiac death associated with this phenotype, she was started on anticoagulation and received a primary prevention ICD.

aneurysm_of_heart_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Right ventricular aneurysm post-trauma
  presenting_complaint: Vague chest discomfort and peripheral oedema
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male presented six months after a high-velocity road traffic accident involving blunt chest trauma. Echocardiography revealed a localized aneurysm of the right ventricular (RV) free wall at the site of a previous myocardial contusion. He was managed conservatively with diuretics and serial imaging to monitor for expansion.

aneurysm_of_heart_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Left atrial aneurysm
  presenting_complaint: Persistent palpitations and shortness of breath
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male was found to have a massive enlargement of the left atrial appendage on chest X-ray, initially mistaken for a mediastinal mass. Transoesophageal echo confirmed a large congenital left atrial aneurysm causing compression of the left main bronchus. He underwent successful surgical excision of the aneurysm to prevent thromboembolic complications.

aneurysm_of_heart_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Chagasic apical aneurysm
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue and pre-syncope
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male originally from Brazil presented with bradycardia and heart failure symptoms. Serology confirmed Chagas disease, and cardiac MRI showed a characteristic "punched-out" apical aneurysm. He was treated with a permanent pacemaker for conduction disease and started on a standard heart failure regimen.

aneurysm_of_heart_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Calcified "eggshell" LV aneurysm
  presenting_complaint: Chronic stable angina and cough
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with a history of MI in the 1980s presented with a persistent cough; a chest X-ray showed a rim of calcification around the cardiac apex. CT confirmed a large, heavily calcified chronic LV aneurysm. Given his age and the stable, calcified nature of the lesion, he was managed conservatively with medical optimisation.

aneurysm_of_heart_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic heart failure secondary to LV aneurysm
  presenting_complaint: Severe orthopnoea and bilateral leg swelling
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female with a known post-MI LV aneurysm presented in acute pulmonary oedema. Investigations showed progressive aneurysmal dilatation and worsening mitral regurgitation due to remodelling. She was stabilised with IV furosemide and nitrates but was deemed high-risk for surgery, necessitating long-term palliative heart failure management.

aneurysm_of_heart_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Infected pseudoaneurysm of the LV
  presenting_complaint: Fever, night sweats, and pleuritic chest pain
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old IV drug user with Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis developed a perivalvular abscess that progressed to an LV pseudoaneurysm. Despite aggressive antibiotic therapy, the pseudoaneurysm expanded rapidly on serial imaging. He underwent emergency valve replacement and patch repair of the pseudoaneurysm but unfortunately died of multi-organ failure post-operatively.

aneurysm_of_heart_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Aneurysm of the atrial septum (ASA)
  presenting_complaint: Transient ischaemic attack (TIA)
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented with transient left-sided paraesthesia and dysarthria. A bubble-study echocardiogram revealed a highly mobile aneurysm of the interatrial septum associated with a patent foramen ovale (PFO). She underwent percutaneous PFO closure to reduce the risk of paradoxical embolism and was discharged on dual antiplatelet therapy.

aneurysm_of_heart_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Right ventricular aneurysm in Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Exercise-induced syncope
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male collapsed during a football match; ECG showed epsilon waves and T-wave inversion in V1-V3. Cardiac MRI demonstrated multiple small aneurysms ("triangle of dysplasia") in the RV outflow tract and apex. He was diagnosed with Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) and advised to cease competitive sports.

aneurysm_of_heart_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-surgical LV aneurysm
  presenting_complaint: Routine post-operative follow-up
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male who had previously undergone a Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) repair in childhood was found to have a small aneurysm at the site of the previous ventriculotomy. The lesion was stable, non-contractile, and asymptomatic. He continues on long-term cardiology follow-up with no immediate intervention required.

aneurysm_of_heart_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute LV aneurysm with persistent ST elevation
  presenting_complaint: Mild chest tightness and anxiety
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male presented three weeks after an untreated "flu-like illness" which was actually a silent MI. His ECG showed persistent ST elevation in precordial leads V2-V5 without reciprocal changes, suggesting an evolving LV aneurysm. Echo confirmed apical dyskinesia and wall thinning; he was started on high-dose statins and ACE inhibitors.

aneurysm_of_heart_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Giant left ventricular aneurysm causing tamponade
  presenting_complaint: Collapse and muffled heart sounds
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with a history of multiple MIs presented in extremis with Beck's triad. Emergency pericardiocentesis drained haemorrhagic fluid, and imaging revealed a rupture of a large, thin-walled LV aneurysm. Despite resuscitative efforts and an attempt at surgical salvage, the patient passed away in the operating theatre.

aneurysm_of_heart_018:
  primary_diagnosis: LV aneurysm following viral myocarditis
  presenting_complaint: New onset heart failure symptoms
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female developed significant LV dysfunction following biopsy-proven Coxsackie B myocarditis. Serial imaging over six months showed the development of a localized apical aneurysm despite the recovery of global EF. She was maintained on heart failure medications and anticoagulation due to localized blood stasis in the apex.

aneurysm_of_heart_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Multiple cardiac aneurysms in Sarcoidosis
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations and exertional dyspnoea
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with systemic sarcoidosis presented with new-onset bundle branch block. Cardiac MRI revealed multiple areas of late gadolinium enhancement and small aneurysmal bulges in both the LV and RV walls. She was treated with corticosteroids and methotrexate to manage the underlying inflammatory process alongside an ICD for primary prevention.

aneurysm_of_heart_020:
  primary_diagnosis: False aneurysm of the LV apex
  presenting_complaint: Pulsatile chest wall mass
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old male presented with a visible, pulsatile mass on the left side of his chest wall. Imaging revealed a massive LV pseudoaneurysm that had eroded through the intercostal space following a forgotten episode of chest trauma decades prior. Given his extreme frailty and the chronicity of the lesion, he was managed with conservative symptom control.
