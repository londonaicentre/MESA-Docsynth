  primary_diagnosis: Emphysema with secondary polycythaemia
  presenting_complaint: Headaches, plethoric complexion, and chronic breathlessness.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old heavy smoker with known emphysema presented with a haematocrit of 0.58. Investigations confirmed secondary polycythaemia driven by chronic nocturnal hypoxaemia. He was started on nocturnal oxygen therapy and advised on strict smoking cessation, which resulted in the stabilisation of his red cell mass.

emphysema_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Swyer-James-MacLeod Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent chest infections and unilateral wheeze.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female with a history of severe childhood bronchiolitis presented with reduced exercise tolerance. Imaging revealed a hyperlucent left lung with significant air trapping and attenuated vascularity, characteristic of Swyer-James syndrome (unilateral emphysema). Management was conservative, focusing on prompt treatment of respiratory infections.
