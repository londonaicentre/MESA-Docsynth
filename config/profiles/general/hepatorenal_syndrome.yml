hepatorenal_syndrome_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (HRS-AKI)
  presenting_complaint: Reduced urine output and worsening jaundice.
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old male with known alcoholic cirrhosis was admitted with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Despite 48 hours of intravenous albumin and antibiotic therapy, his serum creatinine rose from 110 µmol/L to 340 µmol/L. He was diagnosed with HRS-AKI and commenced on Terlipressin infusion, showing a partial renal response after five days.

hepatorenal_syndrome_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Hepatorenal syndrome type 2 (HRS-NAKI)
  presenting_complaint: Refractory ascites and gradual weight gain.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with NASH-related cirrhosis presented to the outpatient clinic with increasing abdominal distension despite high-dose diuretics. Investigations revealed a stable but elevated creatinine of 185 µmol/L and low urinary sodium (<10 mmol/L). She was diagnosed with HRS-NAKI (Type 2) and referred for Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) evaluation.

hepatorenal_syndrome_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic liver failure with HRS-AKI
  presenting_complaint: Haematemesis and confusion.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male with compensated cirrhosis presented with a massive variceal bleed and Grade 3 hepatic encephalopathy. Following haemodynamic stabilisation, he developed anuric renal failure with a creatinine peak of 450 µmol/L. He was transferred to the ICU for continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVH) and Terlipressin for life-threatening HRS-AKI.

hepatorenal_syndrome_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric hepatorenal syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Oliguria following viral gastroenteritis.
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old girl with biliary atresia and end-stage liver disease presented with dehydration and a sharp decline in renal function. Clinical assessment confirmed HRS-AKI triggered by volume depletion and systemic inflammation. She was managed with albumin boluses and low-dose glypressin while being fast-tracked on the paediatric liver transplant list.

hepatorenal_syndrome_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-paracentesis hepatorenal syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Extreme fatigue and dizziness.
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old female underwent a 10-litre large-volume paracentesis for tense ascites but did not receive adequate albumin replacement. Three days later, she presented with a creatinine of 290 µmol/L and hypotension. A diagnosis of HRS-AKI was made, and she required intensive volume expansion and vasopressor support.

hepatorenal_syndrome_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Hepatorenal syndrome in acute liver failure
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressing jaundice and oliguria.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female with no prior history presented with paracetamol-induced acute liver failure. Within 48 hours, she developed profound renal impairment (creatinine 310 µmol/L) consistent with HRS in the context of fulminant hepatic failure. She met King's College Criteria and was listed for urgent "super-urgent" liver transplantation.

hepatorenal_syndrome_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Terlipressin-resistant hepatorenal syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Persistent low urine output.
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old male with HCV-related cirrhosis and HRS-AKI failed to respond to a 72-hour trial of Terlipressin and albumin. His creatinine continued to rise to 520 µmol/L with worsening metabolic acidosis. He was transitioned to palliative symptom management after multi-disciplinary review deemed him unsuitable for renal replacement therapy or transplantation.

hepatorenal_syndrome_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Hepatorenal syndrome with comorbid CKD
  presenting_complaint: Worsening peripheral oedema.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with diabetic nephropathy and cryptogenic cirrhosis presented with subacute renal decline. Differentiating between HRS-NAKI and progressing CKD was challenging, but a marked response to a trial of albumin and midodrine supported a diagnosis of HRS. His management focused on cautious fluid balance and optimising portal hypertension.

hepatorenal_syndrome_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Infection-triggered HRS-AKI
  presenting_complaint: Fever, cough, and decreased urination.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with alcoholic liver disease was admitted with lobar pneumonia and AKI. Despite clearing the infection with antibiotics, his renal function failed to recover, and urinary sodium remained <5 mmol/L. He was diagnosed with HRS-AKI and successfully treated with albumin and Noradrenaline in the High Dependency Unit.

hepatorenal_syndrome_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Hepatorenal syndrome in Budd-Chiari Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset abdominal pain and oliguria.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female presented with acute hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd-Chiari). The resulting acute congestive hepatopathy led to secondary HRS-AKI with a creatinine rise to 260 µmol/L. Renal function improved rapidly following successful radiological decompression of the hepatic veins and anticoagulation.

hepatorenal_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild HRS-NAKI
  presenting_complaint: Gradual increase in serum creatinine.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with compensated NASH cirrhosis showed a slow rise in creatinine from 90 to 140 µmol/L over three months. Ultrasound showed no obstructive uropathy and urine microscopy was bland. He was diagnosed with mild HRS-NAKI and managed in the community with salt restriction and avoidance of nephrotoxic medications.

hepatorenal_syndrome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe HRS-AKI with multi-organ failure
  presenting_complaint: Comatose with jaundice.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male with decompensated cirrhosis presented in septic shock and Grade 4 encephalopathy. He developed severe HRS-AKI (creatinine 600 µmol/L) and required mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and continuous RRT. Despite aggressive ICU support, he succumbed to multi-organ failure.

hepatorenal_syndrome_013:
  primary_diagnosis: HRS-AKI following variceal band ligation
  presenting_complaint: Post-procedural drop in urine output.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female underwent elective variceal band ligation but suffered a post-procedural bleed. The transient hypotension precipitated HRS-AKI in the background of her advanced cirrhosis. She responded well to a short course of Terlipressin and was discharged with baseline renal function after 10 days.

hepatorenal_syndrome_014:
  primary_diagnosis: HRS-AKI masquerading as ATN
  presenting_complaint: Anuria following a fall.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old cirrhotic patient was found on the floor after 12 hours, initially suspected of having rhabdomyolysis-induced ATN. However, lack of granular casts and a fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) <0.1% pointed towards HRS-AKI. A positive response to albumin challenge confirmed the diagnosis of HRS.

hepatorenal_syndrome_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic HRS-NAKI bridging to transplant
  presenting_complaint: Persistent ascites and cachexia.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with PBC-related cirrhosis had been maintained on Midodrine and Octreotide for chronic HRS-NAKI for six months. This strategy successfully stabilised his renal function (creatinine 160-180 µmol/L), allowing him to remain stable enough for a successful orthotopic liver transplant.

hepatorenal_syndrome_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Hepatorenal syndrome in Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Third-trimester jaundice and vomiting.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old primigravida at 36 weeks gestation developed AFLP, leading to emergency delivery. Post-partum, she developed severe AKI with features of HRS, requiring temporary haemodialysis. Her renal function fully recovered as her hepatic synthetic function improved over the following three weeks.

hepatorenal_syndrome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: HRS-AKI triggered by NSAID use
  presenting_complaint: Rapid weight gain and oliguria.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with known cirrhosis took Ibuprofen for back pain, precipitating a rapid decline in renal function. The inhibition of prostaglandins in the setting of portal hypertension led to acute HRS-AKI. He was hospitalised for fluid resuscitation and albumin, with renal function returning to baseline after drug cessation.

hepatorenal_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute HRS-NAKI with cardiac failure
  presenting_complaint: Dyspnoea and abdominal swelling.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old female with cirrhotic cardiomyopathy and portal hypertension presented with worsening biventricular failure. The low cardiac output state exacerbated renal vasoconstriction, leading to subacute HRS-NAKI. Management was complex, requiring careful balance of diuretics for heart failure and albumin for renal perfusion.

hepatorenal_syndrome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: HRS-AKI in Autoimmune Hepatitis flare
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice and dark urine.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female with a new diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis presented with a severe flare. She developed HRS-AKI (creatinine 220 µmol/L) alongside coagulopathy. She was treated with high-dose steroids for the hepatitis and Terlipressin for the HRS, resulting in a gradual recovery of both organs.

hepatorenal_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent HRS-AKI
  presenting_complaint: Third episode of acute renal failure in six months.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male with ongoing alcohol consumption and cirrhosis presented with recurrent HRS-AKI. Each episode was triggered by minor infections and required hospitalisation for Terlipressin. Due to continued alcohol use, he was not a candidate for transplant, and a long-term plan for community-based palliative care was initiated.
