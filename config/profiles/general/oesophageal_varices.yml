  primary_diagnosis: Subacute variceal re-bleeding
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent melaena one week post-discharge
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male was discharged following successful banding of oesophageal varices. He returned 7 days later with melaena and a drop in haemoglobin. Repeat endoscopy showed a post-banding ulcer that had started to bleed, which was managed with haemostatic powder and increased acid suppression.

oesophageal_varices_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Oesophageal varices in Wilson's disease
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice and splenomegaly
  summary_of_course: An 18-year-old male with newly diagnosed Wilson's disease presented with signs of chronic liver disease. Ultrasound showed a dilated portal vein and significant splenomegaly. Screening gastroscopy confirmed the presence of Grade 2 oesophageal varices, which were managed conservatively with non-selective beta-blockers as he was stable.

oesophageal_varices_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Non-cirrhotic portal hypertension with varices
  presenting_complaint: Incidental splenomegaly on imaging
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female with no history of alcohol use or viral hepatitis was found to have splenomegaly during an investigation for pelvic pain. Liver biopsy was normal, but portal pressures were elevated, leading to a diagnosis of idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. OGD revealed Grade 2 oesophageal varices, necessitating primary prophylaxis with propranolol.

Endoscopy showed Grade 2 varices with a "nipple sign" indicating recent bleed; he was treated with EVBL, lactulose, and rifaximin.

oesophageal_varices_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Grade 2 oesophageal varices in Cystic Fibrosis
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal discomfort and hepatomegaly
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male with Cystic Fibrosis-Related Liver Disease (CFRLD) underwent screening for portal hypertension. OGD identified Grade 2 oesophageal varices. Due to his significant pulmonary disease, the choice of beta-blockers was avoided, and he was instead enrolled in a primary prophylaxis programme of serial endoscopic band ligation.

oesophageal_varices_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Oesophageal varices post-Fontan procedure
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic screening in a complex cardiac patient
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old female with a history of a Fontan procedure for tricuspid atresia was screened for Fontan-associated liver disease (FALD). Despite normal liver enzymes, OGD showed small oesophageal varices due to chronic passive hepatic congestion. She was monitored closely by both cardiology and hepatology teams.

  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic variceal haemorrhage in an elderly patient
  presenting_complaint: Syncope and melaena
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with NASH cirrhosis and multiple comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation and CKD, presented after a syncopal episode. Investigation revealed a significant melaena and a drop in Hb from 11 to 6 g/dL. Endoscopy confirmed bleeding Grade 2 varices, but management was complicated by her need for anticoagulation and poor renal reserve for terlipressin.

oesophageal_varices_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Oesophageal varices in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Known cirrhosis, now 24 weeks pregnant
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant female with autoimmune hepatitis-related cirrhosis was referred for variceal screening. OGD at the start of the second trimester showed Grade 2 varices. She was managed with carvedilol and underwent a planned vaginal delivery with a shortened second stage to avoid prolonged Valsalva manoeuvres.

oesophageal_varices_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Failed primary prophylaxis for oesophageal varices
  presenting_complaint: Breakthrough haematemesis while on propranolol
  summary_of_course: A 57-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis had been on propranolol for Grade 2 varices for six months. He presented to the emergency department with sudden haematemesis. Endoscopy showed the varices had progressed to Grade 3 with active bleeding, requiring urgent band ligation and a switch from pharmacological to endoscopic prophylaxis.
