  primary_diagnosis: Acetabular fracture with posterior hip dislocation
  presenting_complaint: Severe right hip pain and limb shortening following a "dashboard injury" in a car crash.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male presented with his right leg in an adducted and internally rotated position. Radiographs showed a posterior wall acetabular fracture with associated femoral head dislocation. After emergency closed reduction in A&E, he underwent definitive open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) to restore joint congruency and prevent early-onset osteoarthritis.

fracture_of_pelvis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic non-union of pelvic ring fracture
  presenting_complaint: Persistent pelvic "clicking" and deep-seated pain six months after initial trauma.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male had previously sustained a stable pelvic fracture managed conservatively. Follow-up CT imaging at six months demonstrated a persistent fracture cleft in the right iliac wing with sclerotic edges, consistent with non-union. He was scheduled for revision surgery involving bone grafting and compression plating.

  primary_diagnosis: Stress fracture of the parasymphyseal pubic bone
  presenting_complaint: Gradual onset of dull groin pain exacerbated by running.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female marathon runner reported increasing discomfort over the pubic symphysis over four weeks. Bone scintigraphy showed increased uptake in the right parasymphyseal region, confirming a stress fracture. Management involved a strict 8-week cessation of high-impact activity and correction of running mechanics.

fracture_of_pelvis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Occult pelvic fracture presenting as failure to cope
  presenting_complaint: Generalised weakness, confusion, and inability to mobilise in an elderly patient.
  summary_of_course: An 89-year-old male was brought to A&E by family after being found on the floor. While he could not localise pain due to cognitive impairment, he winced on pelvic compression. A CT scan identified an undisplaced fracture of the right acetabular roof that was invisible on initial plain films, necessitating admission for pain control and social care planning.

fracture_of_pelvis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Open pelvic fracture with Morel-Lavallée lesion
  presenting_complaint: Large degloving injury over the flank and pelvic instability after a crush injury.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old dock worker was crushed by a shipping container, sustaining an open pelvic ring disruption. Examination revealed a large fluctuant area over the greater trochanter (Morel-Lavallée lesion) and perineal lacerations. He underwent multiple debridements, VAC dressing applications, and internal fixation of the pelvic ring.

fracture_of_pelvis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Pubic rami fracture with extraperitoneal bladder rupture
  presenting_complaint: Lower abdominal pain and gross haematuria following a fall onto a kerb.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female sustained bilateral pubic rami fractures. A retrograde cystogram performed due to haematuria confirmed a small extraperitoneal bladder tear caused by a bony spicule. The bladder injury was managed conservatively with an indwelling catheter for 14 days, while the fractures were managed with protected weight-bearing.

fracture_of_pelvis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Complex acetabular fracture (both columns)
  presenting_complaint: Inability to move the left hip following a fall from a ladder.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male fell 10 feet landing directly on his hip. CT reconstruction showed a "floating" acetabulum with involvement of both anterior and posterior columns.
