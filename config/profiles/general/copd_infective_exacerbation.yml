  primary_diagnosis: Infective exacerbation of COPD in a patient with bronchiectasis
  presenting_complaint: Large volume of foul-smelling purulent sputum
  summary_of_course: A 73-year-old female with an overlap of COPD and bronchiectasis presented with a significant increase in her usual daily sputum production. High-resolution CT (HRCT) confirmed cystic bronchiectasis, and sputum cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus. She required intensive chest physiotherapy and a 14-day course of flucloxacillin to return to her baseline functional status.

copd_infective_exacerbation_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute infective exacerbation of COPD (Diagnostic Challenge)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset dyspnoea and confusion
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including heart failure and COPD, presented with acute confusion and breathlessness. Initial differential included pulmonary oedema and PE, but a CRP of 110 mg/L and purulent sputum pointed towards an infective exacerbation. He responded well to a combination of bronchodilators and antibiotics, with his confusion resolving as his hypercapnia improved.

copd_infective_exacerbation_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild infective exacerbation of COPD (Occupational)
  presenting_complaint: Increased chest tightness and morning cough
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old former coal miner with GOLD Grade 1 COPD presented with a 4-day history of increased cough and greyish-green sputum. He remained haemodynamically stable with an oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. He was managed with an increase in his SABA frequency and a 5-day course of doxycycline, allowing him to continue daily activities with frequent rest.

copd_infective_exacerbation_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Infective exacerbation of COPD with secondary Spontaneous Pneumothorax
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of breathlessness and right-sided chest pain
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male smoker presented with an infective exacerbation that was complicated by a sudden pleuritic pain and rapid desaturation. Chest X-ray revealed a 3cm right-sided pneumothorax likely due to a ruptured bulla during a coughing fit. He required a chest drain insertion alongside treatment for the underlying infection with IV antibiotics and steroids.

copd_infective_exacerbation_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Frequent exacerbator phenotype COPD (Infective)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent breathlessness and sputum change
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female with four previous admissions in the last year presented with a further infective flare. Despite optimal triple therapy (LAMA/LABA/ICS), she continues to experience frequent purulent exacerbations. This episode was managed in the community with prophylactic azithromycin being considered post-infection to reduce future frequency.

copd_infective_exacerbation_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Infective exacerbation of COPD with Type 1 Respiratory Failure
  presenting_complaint: Severe hypoxia and productive cough
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male with significant emphysema presented with a pO2 of 6.8 kPa on room air but a normal pCO2. Chest X-ray showed hyperinflation but no focal consolidation, and he was diagnosed with an infective exacerbation causing severe V/Q mismatch. He required high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) and a 7-day course of co-amoxiclav to resolve the hypoxia.

copd_infective_exacerbation_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-operative infective exacerbation of COPD
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty weaning from oxygen post-cholecystectomy
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female with moderate COPD underwent an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy but developed an infective exacerbation 48 hours post-operatively. She developed a productive cough and increased wheeze, likely due to a combination of general anaesthesia and poor cough effort post-surgery. She was treated with nebulisers and chest physiotherapy, which facilitated her discharge on post-op day five.

copd_infective_exacerbation_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Infective exacerbation of COPD with Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR) organism
  presenting_complaint: Persistent fever and green sputum despite antibiotics
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male with frequent hospitalisations presented with a severe exacerbation that failed to respond to standard first-line antibiotics. Sputum culture subsequently identified an MDR strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Treatment was narrowed to IV meropenem based on sensitivities, requiring a 10-day inpatient stay and close monitoring of renal function.

copd_infective_exacerbation_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Infective exacerbation of COPD in a palliative patient
  presenting_complaint: Distressing breathlessness and rattling cough
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old male with end-stage COPD and multiple comorbidities presented with a further infective episode. Following a multidisciplinary discussion and review of his Advance Care Plan, the focus of care shifted to symptom control. He was managed with low-dose morphine for dyspnoea, sublingual hyoscine for secretions, and oral antibiotics for comfort, remaining in the community setting.

copd_infective_exacerbation_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Infective exacerbation of COPD with associated Atrial Fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations and worsening shortness of breath
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female presented with an infective exacerbation which triggered a new episode of fast Atrial Fibrillation (AF). The systemic inflammation and hypoxia from the COPD flare led to a ventricular rate of 140 bpm. Management involved treating the underlying infection with antibiotics and steroids while simultaneously controlling the heart rate with beta-blockers.

copd_infective_exacerbation_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic infective exacerbation of COPD (Asthma-COPD Overlap)
  presenting_complaint: Nocturnal cough and significant wheezing
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female with a history of childhood asthma and heavy smoking presented with an infective exacerbation. She exhibited significant eosinophilia (0.8 x 10^9/L) and a marked response to intravenous corticosteroids. Her management included a 10-day course of prednisolone and clarithromycin, with a subsequent review of her maintenance ICS dose.

copd_infective_exacerbation_020:
