  primary_diagnosis: Severe OSA with Nocturnal Arrhythmia
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations and waking up gasping
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation underwent Holter monitoring which showed significant nocturnal bradycardia and frequent ectopics. A subsequent sleep study confirmed severe OSA with an AHI of 48. Treatment with CPAP led to a marked reduction in nocturnal arrhythmic episodes and improved heart rate variability.

obstructive_sleep_apnoea_009:
  primary_diagnosis: OSA in Down's Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Daytime somnolence and irritability
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with Down's Syndrome and mid-face hypoplasia was referred for assessment of worsening daytime fatigue. Polysomnography showed moderate OSA with an AHI of 18. Due to sensory issues, he initially struggled with CPAP but was successfully desensitised over three months with the help of a specialist nursing team and a nasal pillow mask.

obstructive_sleep_apnoea_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Post-operative OSA Complication
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent desaturations in recovery room
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with undiagnosed OSA underwent an elective inguinal hernia repair under general anaesthesia. In the recovery room, he developed severe upper airway obstruction and desaturations to 82% following opioid administration. He required emergency airway manoeuvres and was subsequently diagnosed with severe OSA via an inpatient sleep study.

obstructive_sleep_apnoea_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate OSA in a non-obese female
  presenting_complaint: Chronic fatigue and unrefreshing sleep
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female with a BMI of 21 and retrognathia presented with an ESS of 12. Despite the absence of typical risk factors, a sleep study confirmed moderate OSA (AHI 20) related to craniofacial structure. She was successfully treated with a custom-made mandibular advancement splint as she was reluctant to use CPAP.

obstructive_sleep_apnoea_012:
  primary_diagnosis: OSA-COPD Overlap Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Severe exertional dyspnoea and morning headaches
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old smoker with known COPD (FEV1 45% predicted) was found to have nocturnal hypoxia out of proportion to his lung function. Sleep studies confirmed comorbid OSA (AHI 25), termed 'Overlap Syndrome'. He required a combination of nocturnal CPAP and low-flow oxygen to maintain adequate saturations during sleep.

obstructive_sleep_apnoea_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe OSA with Cognitive Impairment
  presenting_complaint: Memory loss and confusion
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male was initially investigated for early-onset dementia due to worsening cognitive function and poor concentration. A comprehensive assessment including a sleep study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 52. Following four months of CPAP therapy, his MMSE score improved from 23 to 27, suggesting OSA was a major reversible contributor to his cognitive decline.

obstructive_sleep_apnoea_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate OSA secondary to Hypothyroidism
  presenting_complaint: Weight gain and lethargy
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female presented with classic hypothyroid symptoms and new-onset snoring. Investigations showed a TSH of 85 mIU/L and a sleep study confirmed moderate OSA (AHI 24). Following six months of levothyroxine replacement and achievement of a euthyroid state, a repeat sleep study showed the AHI had normalised to 4, and CPAP was discontinued.

obstructive_sleep_apnoea_015:
  primary_diagnosis: CPAP Failure due to Claustrophobia
  presenting_complaint: Persistent OSA symptoms despite treatment
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with severe OSA (AHI 40) was unable to tolerate CPAP due to severe claustrophobia and panic attacks when wearing the mask. Despite trying multiple interfaces and desensitisation, compliance remained under 1 hour per night. He was eventually referred for upper airway stimulation therapy (hypoglossal nerve stimulator) as an alternative treatment.

obstructive_sleep_apnoea_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate OSA in Marfan Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Nocturnal choking episodes
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male with Marfan Syndrome and a high-arched palate presented with sleep-disordered breathing. Polysomnography confirmed moderate OSA (AHI 18), likely exacerbated by connective tissue laxity in the upper airway. He was managed with a combination of side-sleeping and a mandibular advancement device with good effect.

obstructive_sleep_apnoea_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe OSA with Cor Pulmonale
  presenting_complaint: Leg swelling and breathlessness
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male presented with signs of right heart failure, including raised JVP and pitting oedema. Echocardiography showed pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy, while a sleep study confirmed severe OSA (AHI 60). Intensive CPAP therapy and diuretics led to a significant reduction in pulmonary artery pressures over the following year.

obstructive_sleep_apnoea_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild OSA in a Professional Athlete
  presenting_complaint: Poor recovery and daytime fatigue
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old professional rugby player with a large neck circumference (19 inches) and a BMI of 31 (predominantly muscle) reported excessive fatigue. Sleep studies revealed mild OSA with an AHI of 14, primarily during REM sleep. He was treated with a custom mouthguard and sleep hygiene education, which improved his athletic performance and recovery metrics.

obstructive_sleep_apnoea_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe OSA with Noctural Epilepsy mimic
  presenting_complaint: Violent nocturnal movements and gasping
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male was referred to neurology for suspected nocturnal seizures. Video-polysomnography instead demonstrated severe OSA with an AHI of 70, where the "seizures" were actually intense arousals and gasping following prolonged apnoeas. CPAP therapy completely abolished the nocturnal movements, confirming the diagnosis of OSA-related pseudo-seizures.

obstructive_sleep_apnoea_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic OSA with Mask-Related Complications
  presenting_complaint: Skin breakdown and eye irritation
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male on long-term CPAP for severe OSA developed chronic pressure sores on the nasal bridge and recurrent conjunctivitis from mask leaks. A specialist technician refitted him with a total face mask and adjusted the pressure settings to include a ramp-up feature. These changes resolved the skin issues and maintained his high level of treatment compliance.
