cholelithiasis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic cholelithiasis
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding on abdominal ultrasound
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female underwent an abdominal ultrasound for investigation of non-specific bloating. Multiple mobile gallstones were identified within a thin-walled gallbladder with no evidence of ductal dilatation or cholecystitis. As she was asymptomatic with normal liver function tests, she was managed conservatively with lifestyle advice and safety netting.

cholelithiasis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Biliary colic
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of severe right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old woman presented with three episodes of intense RUQ pain radiating to the scapula, typically occurring after fatty meals. Ultrasound confirmed multiple small gallstones; blood tests including inflammatory markers and LFTs were unremarkable. She was diagnosed with biliary colic and referred for an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

cholelithiasis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute cholecystitis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent RUQ pain, fever, and nausea
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male presented with a 24-hour history of constant RUQ pain and a temperature of 38.5°C. Clinical examination revealed a positive Murphy’s sign, and bloods showed a leukocytosis (WBC 16.5 x 10^9/L) and CRP of 85 mg/L. He was started on intravenous antibiotics and underwent an early laparoscopic cholecystectomy within 72 hours of admission.

cholelithiasis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Choledocholithiasis with obstructive jaundice
  presenting_complaint: Yellowing of the skin, dark urine, and pale stools
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male presented with painless jaundice and pruritus. LFTs showed a cholestatic pattern with Bilirubin 95 µmol/L and ALP 450 U/L; MRCP confirmed a 7mm stone lodged in the common bile duct (CBD). He underwent successful ERCP with sphincterotomy and stone extraction, followed by a planned cholecystectomy.

cholelithiasis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute gallstone pancreatitis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset epigastric pain radiating to the back
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female presented to A&E with excruciating epigastric pain and vomiting. Serum amylase was significantly elevated at 1200 U/L, and ultrasound demonstrated gallstones with a mildly dilated CBD. She was managed with aggressive fluid resuscitation and analgesia; once the pancreatitis settled, she underwent an index-admission laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

cholelithiasis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Mirizzi Syndrome (Type I)
  presenting_complaint: Obstructive jaundice and RUQ discomfort
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with known gallstones presented with worsening jaundice and raised LFTs. Imaging revealed a large stone impacted in the gallbladder neck causing extrinsic compression of the common hepatic duct. He required complex biliary surgery involving a partial cholecystectomy and T-tube placement to resolve the obstruction.

cholelithiasis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Gallstone ileus
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal distension, vomiting, and constipation
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female presented with features of small bowel obstruction. An abdominal CT scan showed dilated loops of bowel, pneumobilia, and a 3cm calcified mass in the terminal ileum (Rigler’s triad). She underwent an emergency enterolithotomy to remove the impacted gallstone that had migrated through a cholecysto-duodenal fistula.

cholelithiasis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic cholecystitis with porcelain gallbladder
  presenting_complaint: Vague, chronic dyspepsia and RUQ heaviness
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old female with a long history of fatty food intolerance underwent a CT scan which revealed extensive intramural calcification of the gallbladder wall. Given the association with gallbladder carcinoma, she was counselled for prophylactic cholecystectomy despite the paucity of acute symptoms. Histology confirmed chronic cholecystitis and extensive hyalinised calcification.

cholelithiasis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric cholelithiasis (Pigment stones)
  presenting_complaint: Episodic abdominal pain in a child with Sickle Cell Disease
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old boy with known Sickle Cell Anaemia presented with recurrent RUQ pain. Ultrasound identified multiple small, radiopaque pigment stones, a common complication of chronic haemolysis. Due to the high risk of future complications, he underwent an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy during a period of clinical stability.

cholelithiasis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Empyema of the gallbladder
  presenting_complaint: Severe RUQ pain, high swinging pyrexia, and rigors
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old diabetic male presented in septic shock with a palpable, exquisitely tender RUQ mass. Ultrasound showed a distended gallbladder filled with echogenic debris and thickened walls. He was initially stabilised with percutaneous cholecystostomy drainage, which evacuated 150ml of frank pus, before definitive surgery was performed weeks later.

cholelithiasis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute ascending cholangitis
  presenting_complaint: Fever, jaundice, and RUQ pain (Charcot’s Triad)
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old female was admitted with rigors, a bilirubin of 110 µmol/L, and RUQ tenderness. Blood cultures grew E. coli, and imaging confirmed CBD stones. She underwent urgent decompression via ERCP and biliary stenting, followed by intravenous antibiotics, resulting in rapid clinical improvement.

cholelithiasis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Gangrenous cholecystitis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of RUQ pain and signs of peritonitis
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with a 3-day history of cholecystitis suddenly developed generalised abdominal guarding and hypotension. Emergency laparotomy revealed a perforated, gangrenous gallbladder with localised biliary peritonitis. The gallbladder was removed, the peritoneal cavity was washed out, and he required a prolonged course of post-operative intensive care.

cholelithiasis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Biliary sludge and microlithiasis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent idiopathic pancreatitis
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female had two episodes of mild pancreatitis with no obvious cause on initial ultrasound or CT. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was performed, which identified biliary sludge and several 1-2mm microliths within the gallbladder. A cholecystectomy was performed, which successfully prevented further episodes of pancreatitis.

cholelithiasis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Cholecysto-enteric fistula
  presenting_complaint: Chronic diarrhoea and weight loss
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old male with a history of gallstones presented with unusual bowel habits and malabsorption features. Imaging revealed a fistula between the gallbladder and the duodenum, with air in the biliary tree. Due to his significant frailty and multiple comorbidities, he was managed conservatively with nutritional support and monitoring.

cholelithiasis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-cholecystectomy syndrome (Retained stone)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrence of biliary-type pain 3 months post-surgery
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female who had previously undergone a laparoscopic cholecystectomy presented with RUQ pain and deranged LFTs. An MRCP identified a small retained stone in the distal common bile duct. This was successfully managed with ERCP and stone extraction, leading to complete resolution of her symptoms.

cholelithiasis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Cholelithiasis in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent RUQ pain during the third trimester
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old pregnant woman (32 weeks gestation) presented with biliary colic. Ultrasound confirmed stones but no cholecystitis. She was managed with dietary modifications and analgesia, with the aim to delay cholecystectomy until the postpartum period to minimise foetal risk, provided no complications occurred.

cholelithiasis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Mucocele of the gallbladder
  presenting_complaint: Large, non-tender palpable mass in the RUQ
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female presented with a persistent "lump" in her abdomen but minimal pain. Imaging showed a massively distended gallbladder caused by a stone impacted in the cystic duct, leading to the accumulation of sterile mucus. She underwent an elective cholecystectomy, which was technically challenging due to the size of the organ.

cholelithiasis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe gallstone pancreatitis with multi-organ failure
  presenting_complaint: Epigastric pain, respiratory distress, and oliguria
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male was admitted to the ICU with severe acute pancreatitis secondary to gallstones. He developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute kidney injury requiring haemofiltration. Following a three-week ICU stay and resolution of pancreatic collections, he eventually underwent a delayed cholecystectomy.

cholelithiasis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Cholelithiasis with incidental Gallbladder Carcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Routine cholecystectomy for symptomatic stones
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for recurrent biliary colic. Histopathological examination of the specimen unexpectedly revealed a T1b adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder fundus. She was subsequently referred to the hepatobiliary multidisciplinary team (MDT) for consideration of radical re-resection and staging.

cholelithiasis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic RUQ pain and weight loss mimicking malignancy
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male presented with a firm RUQ mass and constitutional symptoms. CT imaging showed a gallbladder with focal wall thickening and suspicious features of invasion into the liver segment IV. Intraoperative frozen section during surgery confirmed xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis, a rare inflammatory variant of cholelithiasis, allowing for a more conservative resection than initially planned.
