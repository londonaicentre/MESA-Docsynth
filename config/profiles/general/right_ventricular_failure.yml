  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset pleuritic chest pain, severe dyspnoea, and near-syncope.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented to A&E with profound hypotension and tachycardia. CTPA confirmed a large saddle embolus with significant RV strain and a D-shaped septum on echocardiography. He received emergency systemic thrombolysis with alteplase, resulting in rapid haemodynamic stabilisation and transfer to the ITU for monitoring.

right_ventricular_failure_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Cor Pulmonale secondary to COPD
  presenting_complaint: Progressive worsening of bilateral leg swelling and increased sputum production.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female smoker with severe COPD presented to the outpatient clinic with gross peripheral oedema and raised JVP. Investigations revealed chronic hypoxaemia and an ECG showing right axis deviation with P-pulmonale. She was started on long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) and oral furosemide, showing moderate improvement in her functional capacity.

right_ventricular_failure_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Right Ventricular Infarction
  presenting_complaint: Crushing retrosternal chest pain and profound light-headedness.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male was admitted with an inferior STEMI; however, he developed severe hypotension following nitrate administration. Right-sided ECG leads V3R-V4R showed ST-elevation, and echocardiography confirmed RV free-wall akinesia. He was managed with aggressive fluid resuscitation and urgent PCI to the right coronary artery, avoiding further nitrates and diuretics.

right_ventricular_failure_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (IPAH)
  presenting_complaint: Exertional syncope and progressive fatigue over six months.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female was referred to the specialist PH centre after an echo showed a peak TRV of 4.5 m/s. Right heart catheterisation confirmed a mean pulmonary artery pressure of 52 mmHg with a normal wedge pressure. She was commenced on dual oral therapy with macitentan and tadalafil, with a subsequent transition to intravenous epoprostenol due to clinical worsening.

right_ventricular_failure_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations and a single episode of collapse during a football match.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male underwent cardiac MRI which demonstrated fibrofatty replacement of the RV myocardium and an enlarged, aneurysmal RV. ECG showed epsilon waves in leads V1-V3 and T-wave inversion. He was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and advised to avoid competitive sports to prevent life-threatening arrhythmias.

right_ventricular_failure_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Biventricular Heart Failure (HFrEF with secondary RVF)
  presenting_complaint: Orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, and abdominal bloating.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male with long-standing ischaemic cardiomyopathy (LVEF 25%) developed worsening congestive symptoms. Clinical examination revealed hepatomegaly and ascites, suggesting secondary right-sided failure due to chronic pulmonary venous hypertension. He was managed with intravenous bumetanide and optimisation of his quadruple therapy, but remained in NYHA Class IV.

right_ventricular_failure_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Repaired Tetralogy of Fallot with Severe Pulmonary Regurgitation
  presenting_complaint: Reduced exercise tolerance and palpitations in a paediatric patient.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy, who had primary repair of TOF as an infant, presented with increasing lethargy. Cardiac MRI showed severe pulmonary regurgitation with an RV end-diastolic volume index of 160 ml/m². He underwent successful percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation (PPVI), resulting in a significant reduction in RV size and improvement in symptoms.

right_ventricular_failure_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Systemic Sclerosis-associated Pulmonary Hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Severe breathlessness on minimal exertion and Raynaud's phenomenon.
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old female with known scleroderma was found to have a significantly elevated NT-proBNP and RV hypertrophy on ECG. Echocardiography suggested severe pulmonary hypertension, which was confirmed on right heart catheterisation. Despite treatment with endothelin receptor antagonists, she developed refractory RV failure and was evaluated for lung transplantation.

right_ventricular_failure_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Tricuspid Valve Endocarditis
  presenting_complaint: Fever, rigors, and new-onset right-sided heart failure symptoms.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use presented with Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia. Echocardiography revealed large, mobile vegetations on the tricuspid valve causing severe regurgitation and acute RV dilatation. He required prolonged intravenous antibiotics and eventual surgical valve repair due to persistent sepsis and worsening RV failure.

right_ventricular_failure_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent dyspnoea 12 months following a diagnosed pulmonary embolism.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old female remained symptomatic despite therapeutic anticoagulation. A V/Q scan showed multiple segmental perfusion defects, and pulmonary angiography confirmed proximal thromboembolic disease. She underwent a successful pulmonary endarterectomy at a specialist centre, which led to a dramatic reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance and RV afterload.

right_ventricular_failure_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (Pickwickian Syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Excessive daytime somnolence and peripheral oedema.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with a BMI of 48 kg/m² presented with signs of right-sided heart failure. Arterial blood gas showed hypercapnic respiratory failure, and sleep studies confirmed severe obstructive sleep apnoea. He was treated with nocturnal BiPAP and diuretics, which improved his RV function and reduced his pulmonary pressures over several months.

right_ventricular_failure_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Carcinoid Heart Disease
  presenting_complaint: Episodic flushing, diarrhoea, and increasing abdominal girth.
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old male with a known neuroendocrine tumour presented with signs of right-sided failure. Echocardiography showed characteristic thickened, retracted tricuspid and pulmonary valve leaflets causing severe stenosis and regurgitation. He was managed with somatostatin analogues and underwent triple valve surgery (tricuspid and pulmonary replacement) to alleviate the RV volume overload.

right_ventricular_failure_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Secundum Atrial Septal Defect with Eisenmenger Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Central cyanosis and clubbing in a previously undiagnosed adult.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male presented with exertional dyspnoea and was found to have an oxygen saturation of 82% on room air. Investigations revealed a large secundum ASD with a reversed (right-to-left) shunt due to irreversible pulmonary hypertension. Management was focused on palliative medical therapy with sildenafil, as the defect was no longer amenable to surgical closure.

right_ventricular_failure_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Atrial Fibrillation with Functional Tricuspid Regurgitation
  presenting_complaint: Irregular palpitations and progressive ankle swelling.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old female with permanent AF presented with significant hepatic congestion. Echocardiography showed massive right atrial and ventricular dilatation with "torrential" functional tricuspid regurgitation due to annular stretching. She was managed with rate control and high-dose loop diuretics, but remained at high risk for recurrent hospitalisations.

right_ventricular_failure_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Constrictive Pericarditis mimicking Right Heart Failure
  presenting_complaint: Raised JVP with a prominent y-descent and peripheral oedema.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male with a history of treated tuberculosis presented with symptoms of systemic venous congestion. Echocardiography and cardiac MRI showed a thickened, calcified pericardium with respiratory septal bounce and restrictive filling. He underwent a pericardiectomy, which successfully resolved the clinical signs of right-sided failure.

right_ventricular_failure_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-LVAD Acute Right Ventricular Failure
  presenting_complaint: Low flow alarms and hypotension following Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) implantation.
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old male underwent LVAD surgery for end-stage heart failure but developed immediate post-operative RV failure due to increased venous return. He required prolonged inotropic support with milrinone and inhaled nitric oxide to reduce RV afterload. After ten days of intensive care, his RV function recovered sufficiently to allow weaning of the pulmonary vasodilators.

right_ventricular_failure_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Pulmonary Sarcoidosis with Cor Pulmonale
  presenting_complaint: Dry cough and progressive breathlessness on walking.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female with Stage IV pulmonary sarcoidosis developed signs of right heart failure. Imaging showed extensive pulmonary fibrosis and echocardiography confirmed RV hypertrophy with impaired systolic function. She was treated with oral corticosteroids and diuretics, though her prognosis remained poor due to the severity of the underlying parenchymal lung disease.

right_ventricular_failure_018:
  primary_diagnosis: High-Altitude Pulmonary Oedema (HAPE) with Acute RV Strain
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive dyspnoea and cough at 4,000 metres altitude.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male mountaineer developed acute respiratory distress and cyanosis. Physical examination showed bilateral crackles and signs of acute RV pressure overload. He was treated with immediate descent, supplemental oxygen, and nifedipine, resulting in complete resolution of the RV strain and pulmonary oedema within 48 hours.

right_ventricular_failure_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Rheumatic Mitral Stenosis with Secondary Pulmonary Hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Haemoptysis and severe exertional dyspnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 47-year-old female, originally from a region where rheumatic fever is endemic, presented with a mid-diastolic murmur and signs of right-sided failure. Echocardiography revealed critical mitral stenosis (valve area 0.8 cm²) and severe secondary pulmonary hypertension. She underwent successful mitral valve replacement, which led to a gradual regression of the pulmonary pressures and RV recovery.

right_ventricular_failure_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Cardiac Amyloidosis (AL Type)
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss, macroglossia, and severe congestive heart failure.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male presented with refractory oedema and low voltage ECG traces. Echocardiography showed "sparkling" myocardial texture and severe restrictive physiology with predominant right-sided symptoms. Despite initiation of chemotherapy for the underlying plasma cell dyscrasia, he succumbed to progressive RV failure and multi-organ congestion.
