  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Variceal Haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent haematemesis despite endoscopic intervention.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with Child-Pugh C cirrhosis experienced re-bleeding 12 hours after initial variceal banding. Despite a second attempt at endoscopic therapy, haemostasis was not achieved, requiring the insertion of a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube as a bridge to a Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) procedure.

variceal_bleeding_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute Variceal Bleeding with Iron Deficiency Anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Exertional dyspnoea and dark stools.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old female with NASH-related cirrhosis presented to the outpatient clinic with a haemoglobin of 72 g/L and positive faecal occult blood. OGD revealed "cherry red spots" on Grade II oesophageal varices without active spurting, suggesting chronic low-grade oozing. She was treated with elective EVL and iron supplementation.

variceal_bleeding_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic Variceal Bleed triggered by NSAID use
  presenting_complaint: Haematemesis following ingestion of ibuprofen for back pain.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with Hepatitis C cirrhosis and stable portal hypertension took high-dose NSAIDs for three days. He presented with acute haematemesis; endoscopy revealed a ruptured oesophageal varix adjacent to a small NSAID-induced gastric erosion. Bleeding was controlled with four bands, and he was counselled on avoiding nephrotoxic and gastrotoxic medications.

  primary_diagnosis: Bleeding Ectopic Duodenal Varices
  presenting_complaint: Profuse melaena and syncope.
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old male with portal hypertension of unknown aetiology had a negative OGD and colonoscopy despite ongoing melaena. A CT angiogram identified bleeding duodenal varices in the third part of the duodenum. Haemostasis was eventually achieved via interventional radiology-guided balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO).

variceal_bleeding_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Variceal Haemorrhage in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Haematemesis at 24 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old pregnant female with known cirrhosis secondary to autoimmune hepatitis presented with fresh vomiting of blood. She was managed in a high-dependency unit with cautious fluid resuscitation and urgent OGD, which showed Grade II varices; these were banded without foetal distress. She remained on low-dose beta-blockers for the remainder of her pregnancy.

variceal_bleeding_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Schistosomiasis-associated Variceal Bleeding
  presenting_complaint: Large volume haematemesis and massive splenomegaly.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male recently migrated from sub-Saharan Africa presented with acute upper GI bleeding. OGD showed Grade IV oesophageal varices, but liver function tests and synthetic function were remarkably preserved. Serology confirmed Schistosoma mansoni, and he was treated with praziquantel alongside endoscopic variceal obliteration.

variceal_bleeding_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-Banding Ulcer Haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Fresh haematemesis 10 days after elective banding.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male underwent elective EVL for primary prophylaxis of large varices. He returned to A&E ten days later with significant haematemesis; OGD showed bleeding from a deep ulcer at a previous banding site. This was managed with a haemostatic powder spray (Hemospray) and an increased dose of proton pump inhibitors.

variceal_bleeding_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Variceal Bleeding in Budd-Chiari Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal distension and melaena.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female on the oral contraceptive pill presented with acute onset ascites and melaena. Imaging confirmed hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd-Chiari) and OGD showed rapidly developed oesophageal varices with a "white nipple" sign. She was anticoagulated and underwent emergency EVL followed by radiological stenting of the hepatic veins.

variceal_bleeding_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Bleeding Anorectal Varices
  presenting_complaint: Bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR).
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male with Child-Pugh B cirrhosis was admitted for suspected haemorrhoidal bleeding. Colonoscopy revealed large, tortuous anorectal varices rather than internal haemorrhoids, with evidence of recent haemorrhage. Due to the high risk of surgical ligation, he was managed with TIPS to reduce portal pressure, which successfully halted the rectal bleeding.

variceal_bleeding_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Variceal Bleeding in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Haematemesis and jaundice.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old smoker previously diagnosed with COPD presented with his first episode of GI bleeding. Physical exam revealed spider naevi and icterus; OGD confirmed bleeding oesophageal varices. Subsequent testing confirmed PiZZ phenotype Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency with established cirrhosis.

  primary_diagnosis: Bleeding Stomal Varices
  presenting_complaint: Profuse bleeding from around an ileostomy site.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis and a previous proctocolectomy for Ulcerative Colitis presented with life-threatening haemorrhage from her stoma. Examination revealed "caput medusae" around the stoma (stomal varices). Bleeding was temporarily controlled with local pressure and later definitively managed with TIPS.

variceal_bleeding_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Variceal Ooze in Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC)
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue and dark-coloured stools.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female with PBC presented with a drop in haemoglobin from 115 g/L to 90 g/L. OGD identified Grade I oesophageal varices with overlying red signs and a slow ooze. She was started on carvedilol and her ursodeoxycholic acid dose was reviewed, with no further episodes of melaena over a six-month follow-up.

  presenting_complaint: Massive haematemesis while in ICU for sepsis.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with decompensated cirrhosis was in ICU for pneumonia-related septic shock. He developed a sudden, catastrophic variceal bleed; despite emergency OGD and attempts at balloon tamponade, he developed PEA cardiac arrest. Resuscitation was unsuccessful, and he died from exsanguination.

variceal_bleeding_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent Variceal Bleeding due to Beta-blocker Intolerance
  presenting_complaint: Repeated episodes of light-headedness and melaena.
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male with cirrhosis and severe asthma was unable to tolerate non-selective beta-blockers for portal hypertension. Despite monthly EVL sessions, he had three admissions for minor variceal bleeds in six months. He was eventually transitioned to a regular banding programme every two weeks until obliteration was achieved.

  primary_diagnosis: Acute Variceal Bleed in Wilson's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Haematemesis and tremors.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male presented with neurological symptoms and sudden haematemesis. OGD showed Grade III varices which were successfully banded; further workup revealed low caeruloplasmin and high urinary copper. He was started on penicillamine and referred to a specialist liver transplant centre.

variceal_bleeding_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Variceal Haemorrhage secondary to Hereditary Haemochromatosis
  presenting_complaint: Melaena and "bronzed" skin.
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old male with a history of diabetes and joint pain presented with melaena. OGD confirmed bleeding oesophageal varices, and a subsequent ferritin level of 4500 ng/mL led to a diagnosis of haemochromatosis. After initial variceal stabilization with EVL, he commenced a programme of therapeutic venesection.

variceal_bleeding_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Bleeding Oesophageal Varices with Coagulopathy
  presenting_complaint: Haematemesis and bruising.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with acute-on-chronic liver failure presented with haematemesis and an INR of 3.4. She received prothrombin complex concentrate and Vitamin K alongside emergency OGD for variceal banding. Despite successful banding, she required prolonged ICU admission for management of hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy.
