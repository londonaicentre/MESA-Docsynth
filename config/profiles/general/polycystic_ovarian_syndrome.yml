  primary_diagnosis: PCOS with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
  presenting_complaint: Excessive thirst, fatigue, and worsening facial hair growth.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old woman with chronic PCOS presented with new-onset polyuria. HbA1c was 52 mmol/mol, confirming a progression to Type 2 Diabetes likely exacerbated by PCOS-related insulin resistance. Management included dual therapy with Metformin and a GLP-1 agonist to address both glycaemic control and weight.

polycystic_ovarian_syndrome_008:
  primary_diagnosis: PCOS-related Androgenic Alopecia
  presenting_complaint: Thinning hair on the scalp and increased facial hair.
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old woman reported significant psychological distress due to male-pattern baldness and hirsutism (Ferriman-Gallwey score of 12). Biochemical screening confirmed PCOS with highly elevated DHEAS levels. She was prescribed Spironolactone 100mg daily and topical Minoxidil, showing moderate hair regrowth after nine months.

polycystic_ovarian_syndrome_009:
  primary_diagnosis: PCOS with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA)
  presenting_complaint: Daytime somnolence and loud snoring.
  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old obese woman with known PCOS was referred to the sleep clinic. A sleep study confirmed moderate OSA, a common but underdiagnosed comorbidity in PCOS patients with high BMI. She was started on CPAP therapy and saw improvements in both her fatigue and metabolic parameters.

polycystic_ovarian_syndrome_010:
  primary_diagnosis: PCOS and Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of deranged liver function tests (LFTs).
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old woman with PCOS had persistently raised ALT and GGT during routine screening. An abdominal ultrasound revealed hepatic steatosis consistent with NAFLD. She was advised on intensive lifestyle changes and Vitamin E supplementation, with subsequent improvement in liver enzymes.

polycystic_ovarian_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: PCOS with Depression and Body Dysmorphia
  presenting_complaint: Low mood and social withdrawal related to physical appearance.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old woman with PCOS-related hirsutism and weight gain presented with severe depressive symptoms. She felt unable to leave the house due to her facial hair. A multidisciplinary approach involving CBT, laser hair removal, and the COCP was implemented to address both the physical and psychological aspects of her condition.

polycystic_ovarian_syndrome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: PCOS Diagnostic Challenge (Late Presentation)
  presenting_complaint: Irregular cycles since stopping the pill at age 38.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old woman who had been on hormonal contraception for 20 years presented with oligomenorrhoea upon cessation. Initial concerns for premature ovarian insufficiency were ruled out by normal FSH levels. Ultrasound and clinical hyperandrogenism confirmed a late-stage diagnosis of PCOS, which had been masked by long-term contraceptive use.

polycystic_ovarian_syndrome_013:
  primary_diagnosis: PCOS with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM)
  presenting_complaint: Routine glucose tolerance test (GTT) at 26 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old pregnant woman with a pre-existing diagnosis of PCOS underwent an oral GTT. Results showed a fasting glucose of 5.8 mmol/L, confirming GDM. She required insulin therapy for the remainder of the pregnancy due to the high degree of insulin resistance associated with her underlying PCOS.

polycystic_ovarian_syndrome_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Clomifene-Resistant PCOS Infertility
  presenting_complaint: Failure to ovulate despite maximum dose Clomifene.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old woman with PCOS failed to achieve follicle maturation after three cycles of Clomifene Citrate 150mg. She was subsequently referred for laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD). Following the procedure, she established regular spontaneous ovulation and conceived naturally four months later.

polycystic_ovarian_syndrome_015:
  primary_diagnosis: PCOS with Chronic Pelvic Pain
  presenting_complaint: Persistent dull ache in the lower abdomen.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old woman with PCOS presented with chronic pelvic pain. While ultrasound showed characteristic polycystic ovaries, the severity of pain was atypical for PCOS. Further investigation via laparoscopy identified co-existing stage II endometriosis, highlighting the importance of excluding other causes of pelvic pain in PCOS patients.

polycystic_ovarian_syndrome_016:
  primary_diagnosis: PCOS and Hyperprolactinaemia Overlap
  presenting_complaint: Galactorrhoea and absent periods.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old woman presented with symptoms suggestive of PCOS but also reported nipple discharge. Blood tests showed mildly elevated Prolactin (850 mIU/L) alongside high androgens. Pituitary MRI was clear, suggesting the hyperprolactinaemia was functional or related to the PCOS-induced endocrine milieu; both symptoms responded to Metformin and low-dose Cabergoline.

polycystic_ovarian_syndrome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: PCOS with Severe Hidradenitis Suppurativa
  presenting_complaint: Painful, recurrent abscesses in the axilla and groin.
  summary_of_course: A 23-year-old woman with PCOS presented with severe inflammatory skin nodules. The diagnosis of hidradenitis suppurativa was made, which is frequently associated with the hyperandrogenism of PCOS. Management required a combination of long-term antibiotics, surgical drainage, and anti-androgen therapy (Cyproterone acetate).

polycystic_ovarian_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Incidental PCOS during Appendicectomy
  presenting_complaint: Acute right iliac fossa pain.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old woman underwent an emergency appendicectomy. Intraoperatively, the surgeon noted classical "oyster shell" appearance of both ovaries with multiple subcortical cysts. Post-operative follow-up with bloods and history confirmed a diagnosis of previously asymptomatic PCOS.

polycystic_ovarian_syndrome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: PCOS with Eating Disorder (Bulimia Nervosa)
  presenting_complaint: Weight fluctuations and irregular menses.
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old woman with a history of Bulimia presented with oligomenorrhoea. The diagnostic process was complicated as both PCOS and eating disorders can cause menstrual irregularity. However, the presence of clinical hirsutism and biochemical hyperandrogenism confirmed PCOS, requiring a coordinated care plan between the eating disorder unit and endocrinology.

polycystic_ovarian_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: PCOS and Cardiovascular Risk Management
  presenting_complaint: Family history of early myocardial infarction and known PCOS.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old woman with a 30-year history of PCOS presented for a cardiovascular check-up. Screening revealed hypertension (155/95 mmHg) and hypercholesterolaemia (Total cholesterol 6.8 mmol/L).
