  primary_diagnosis: Bipolar Affective Disorder in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Relapse of manic symptoms during the second trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant female (20 weeks gestation) with known BAD stopped her Sodium Valproate due to teratogenic risks and subsequently relapsed with manic symptoms.

  presenting_complaint: Mutism, waxy flexibility, and refusal of oral intake.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with a 20-year history of BAD presented in a catatonic state. Physical causes were excluded via CT head and bloods.

  presenting_complaint: Chronic mood instability and poor concentration.
  summary_of_course: An 18-year-old male student presented with recurrent depressive episodes and brief periods of over-activity.

  presenting_complaint: Binge drinking during manic episodes leading to social breakdown.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with BAD often used alcohol to "self-medicate" during manic phases, leading to aggressive behaviour and police contact.

  presenting_complaint: Disinhibited behaviour and excessive talking following surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male with a history of BAD developed hypomania 48 hours after an elective hip replacement, possibly triggered by post-operative steroids and sleep disruption.

  presenting_complaint: Claims of possessing supernatural powers and preaching in public.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male was brought to the hospital by police after attempting to "walk on water" at a local lake. He was highly aroused and required rapid tranquilisation with Promethazine and Haloperidol.

  presenting_complaint: Memory concerns and social withdrawal.
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old male with long-standing BAD presented with what appeared to be "pseudodementia." Cognitive testing (ACE-III) showed deficits that improved significantly as his depressive symptoms were treated with Lamotrigine. This highlighted the importance of distinguishing geriatric depression from primary neurodegenerative disorders in patients with BAD.

  presenting_complaint: Recurrent winter depressions and springtime hypomania.
  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old female described a 5-year pattern of severe depressive episodes every November, followed by a period of high productivity and decreased sleep every April. The introduction of light therapy for the depressive phase and a consistent dose of Lithium year-round helped dampen the seasonal fluctuations and improved her quality of life.
