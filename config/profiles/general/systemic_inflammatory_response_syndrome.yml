  primary_diagnosis: Ischaemic Bowel with SIRS
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal pain and metabolic acidosis
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old female with atrial fibrillation presented with sudden, generalised abdominal pain. She was tachycardic (HR 112 bpm) and tachypnoeic (RR 25 breaths/min) with a lactate of 7.2 mmol/L. Emergency laparotomy revealed extensive small bowel ischaemia; despite resection, the SIRS progressed to multi-organ failure due to massive cytokine release from reperfusion injury.

systemic_inflammatory_response_syndrome_015:
  primary_diagnosis: TRALI (Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury)
  presenting_complaint: Acute hypoxia following blood transfusion
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female receiving a blood transfusion for symptomatic anaemia developed sudden respiratory distress 2 hours into the infusion.

  presenting_complaint: Chest pain and fever three weeks post-MI
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male presented with pleuritic chest pain and a temperature of 38.4°C, 21 days after an acute myocardial infarction. Investigations showed a HR of 98 bpm, elevated ESR, and a pericardial effusion on echo. He was diagnosed with Dressler's syndrome, a subacute immune-mediated SIRS, and responded well to high-dose aspirin and colchicine.

systemic_inflammatory_response_syndrome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Fat Embolism Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Confusion and shortness of breath following trauma
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with a closed comminuted femur fracture developed sudden hypoxia and a petechial rash 48 hours post-injury. He met SIRS criteria with a HR of 130 bpm, RR 28 breaths/min, and a temperature of 38.8°C. Clinical diagnosis of fat embolism syndrome was made, and he was managed with supportive oxygen therapy and fluid balance until the inflammatory response subsided.

systemic_inflammatory_response_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Haemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent high fever and jaundice
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old male presented with a two-week history of daily fevers >39.5°C, splenomegaly, and cytopenias (Hb 80 g/L, WBC 2.1 x 10^9/L). He was in a continuous SIRS state with extreme hyperferritinaemia (>10,000 ng/mL). Bone marrow aspirate confirmed haemophagocytosis, and he was treated with dexamethasone and etoposide for this life-threatening hyperinflammatory syndrome.

systemic_inflammatory_response_syndrome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Sterile SIRS post-Haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Tachycardia and fever following obstetric haemorrhage
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old female suffered a 2.5-litre primary postpartum haemorrhage. Following successful embolisation and transfusion of 6 units of RBCs, she developed a temperature of 38.7°C, HR 125 bpm, and a WCC of 21.0 x 10^9/L. Cultures remained negative, and the SIRS was attributed to the physiological stress of massive haemorrhage and the subsequent inflammatory response to blood products.

systemic_inflammatory_response_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Pancreatitis with persistent SIRS
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent fevers and worsening abdominal distension
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male was admitted with moderate acute pancreatitis. While initially stable, he developed persistent SIRS (HR >110, RR >24) beyond 48 hours, which is a poor prognostic sign. Repeat CT imaging showed extensive pancreatic necrosis; he required prolonged enteral nutrition and targeted necrosectomy when the sterile SIRS eventually transitioned to infected necrosis.
