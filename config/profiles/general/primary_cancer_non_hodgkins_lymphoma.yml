  primary_diagnosis: Mantle cell lymphoma
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue, early satiety, and palpable splenomegaly.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension presented with progressive lethargy and abdominal fullness. Clinical examination revealed a spleen palpable 6cm below the costal margin and generalised lymphadenopathy. Bone marrow aspirate confirmed Mantle cell lymphoma with t(11;14) translocation, and he was commenced on R-BAC (rituximab, bendamustine, and cytarabine) due to the aggressive presentation.

primary_cancer_non_hodgkins_lymphoma_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary CNS lymphoma
  presenting_complaint: New-onset seizures and progressive cognitive decline.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old HIV-positive male presented with a first-time generalised tonic-clonic seizure and two weeks of confusion. MRI brain showed multiple ring-enhancing lesions, and stereotactic biopsy confirmed DLBCL of the central nervous system. Despite high-dose methotrexate and antiretroviral therapy, the patient's condition deteriorated rapidly, and he was transitioned to palliative care.

primary_cancer_non_hodgkins_lymphoma_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Gastric MALT lymphoma
  presenting_complaint: Persistent dyspepsia and epigastric pain.
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old female with long-standing reflux underwent gastroscopy which revealed an ulcerative lesion in the gastric antrum. Biopsy confirmed extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) associated with Helicobacter pylori infection. Following H. pylori eradication therapy, follow-up endoscopy at 6 months showed complete histological regression of the lymphoma.

primary_cancer_non_hodgkins_lymphoma_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Mycosis fungoides
  presenting_complaint: Chronic pruritic skin patches misdiagnosed as eczema.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male had a 5-year history of scaly, erythematous plaques on his trunk that were refractory to topical steroids. Skin punch biopsy finally revealed Pautrier microabscesses and a clonal T-cell population consistent with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (Mycosis fungoides). He is currently managed in a specialist dermatology clinic with PUVA phototherapy and topical nitrogen mustard.

  primary_diagnosis: Splenic marginal zone lymphoma
  presenting_complaint: Left-sided abdominal discomfort and anaemia.
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old female presented with dragging sensations in her left flank and was found to have massive splenomegaly. Peripheral blood film showed "villous" lymphocytes, and immunophenotyping supported a diagnosis of splenic marginal zone lymphoma. Due to symptomatic splenomegaly and worsening cytopenias, she underwent a splenectomy, which provided symptomatic relief and stabilised her blood counts.

primary_cancer_non_hodgkins_lymphoma_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Spinal)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset lower limb weakness and back pain.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male was admitted as an emergency with T10 paraparesis and urinary retention. MRI showed an epidural mass causing spinal cord compression.

  primary_diagnosis: Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL)
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss, chronic diarrhoea, and bowel perforation.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male with a history of poorly controlled coeliac disease presented with acute peritonitis. Emergency laparotomy revealed a perforated jejunal segment, and histology showed EATL. Despite aggressive surgical resection and attempts at nutritional support, the patient developed post-operative sepsis and multi-organ failure.

primary_cancer_non_hodgkins_lymphoma_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Transformed follicular lymphoma
  presenting_complaint: Rapid growth of a pre-existing stable lymph node.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old female with known Grade 1 follicular lymphoma for six years presented with a sudden, painful enlargement of a left axillary node. Repeat biopsy confirmed transformation to DLBCL (Richter-like transformation). She was treated with R-CHOP followed by an autologous stem cell transplant, achieving a second complete remission.

  primary_diagnosis: Primary effusion lymphoma
  presenting_complaint: Progressive breathlessness and abdominal bloating.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with advanced HIV and previous Kaposi sarcoma presented with large pleural and peritoneal effusions. Cytology of the fluid revealed large pleomorphic malignant B-cells positive for HHV-8. This rare NHL subtype was treated with modified chemotherapy and optimized HAART, but the prognosis remained poor with limited response.

primary_cancer_non_hodgkins_lymphoma_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent cervical lymphadenopathy.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including heart failure, was investigated for stable neck lumps. Biopsy and flow cytometry confirmed SLL, the tissue equivalent of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Given his age and the indolent nature of the disease, he is managed conservatively with 6-monthly clinical reviews.

primary_cancer_non_hodgkins_lymphoma_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary bone lymphoma
  presenting_complaint: Localised pain in the right femur and a pathological fracture.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female presented with a mid-shaft femoral fracture following minimal trauma. Imaging showed a lytic lesion, and biopsy surprisingly revealed DLBCL isolated to the bone. She underwent intramedullary nailing followed by six cycles of R-CHOP and consolidated radiotherapy to the femur, with no evidence of systemic disease.

primary_cancer_non_hodgkins_lymphoma_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (Waldenström macroglobulinaemia)
  presenting_complaint: Epistaxis, blurred vision, and headache.
  summary_of_course: A 71-year-old male presented with symptoms of hyperviscosity syndrome. Laboratory tests showed a massive IgM paraprotein (55g/L) and bone marrow biopsy showed lymphoplasmacytic infiltration. He underwent emergency plasmapheresis to reduce serum viscosity followed by treatment with rituximab and zanubrutinib.

primary_cancer_non_hodgkins_lymphoma_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD)
  presenting_complaint: Fever and graft tenderness 2 years post-renal transplant.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female renal transplant recipient presented with systemic symptoms and a rising EBV viral load. Biopsy of a newly developed hilar mass confirmed monomorphic PTLD (DLBCL type). Management involved reduction of immunosuppression and rituximab monotherapy, resulting in a partial response and preservation of the renal graft.

primary_cancer_non_hodgkins_lymphoma_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), ALK-positive
  presenting_complaint: High fever and a large mass in the groin.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male presented with a 2-week history of drenching sweats and a painful 6cm inguinal mass. Biopsy showed large pleomorphic cells with "hallmark" morphology and strong ALK and CD30 positivity. He responded exceptionally well to brentuximab vedotin combined with CHP chemotherapy, achieving complete remission.

primary_cancer_non_hodgkins_lymphoma_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
  presenting_complaint: Relapsed disease shortly after finishing first-line therapy.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female achieved a partial response to R-CHOP for DLBCL but had disease progression within 3 months of completion. She failed second-line salvage chemotherapy (R-GDP). Due to her refractory status, she was referred for CAR-T cell therapy (Tisagenlecleucel) and is currently undergoing lymphodepleting chemotherapy.
