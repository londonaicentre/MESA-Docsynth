urinary_retention_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute urinary retention secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia
  presenting_complaint: Sudden inability to void and severe suprapubic pain
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male presented to A&E with a 6-hour history of agonising pressure and inability to pass urine. Examination revealed a palpable, tender bladder; a bladder scan confirmed a volume of 950ml. He underwent immediate urethral catheterisation with relief of symptoms and was started on tamsulosin 400mcg daily pending a trial without catheter (TWOC).

urinary_retention_002:
  primary_diagnosis: High-pressure chronic urinary retention
  presenting_complaint: Overflow incontinence and nocturnal enuresis
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male reported progressive hesitancy and damp sheets at night over several months. Investigations revealed a non-tender, distended bladder to the level of the umbilicus and a serum creatinine of 450 µmol/L, indicating obstructive uropathy. He required hospital admission for monitored decompression to manage the risk of post-obstructive diuresis.

urinary_retention_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute urinary retention secondary to Cauda Equina Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Lower back pain, saddle anaesthesia, and inability to void
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented with acute onset sciatica and numbness in the perineal region. Clinical assessment confirmed loss of anal tone and a bladder scan showed 700ml of retained urine. Urgent MRI spine demonstrated a large L4/L5 disc prolapse, necessitating emergency surgical decompression within 12 hours.

urinary_retention_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Fowler's Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Painless urinary retention in a young female
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female presented with a 24-hour history of being unable to void despite a full sensation. Neurological examination and pelvic ultrasound were unremarkable, but urethral pressure profilometry showed an overactive sphincter. She was diagnosed with Fowler's syndrome and commenced on clean intermittent self-catheterisation (CISC).

urinary_retention_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-operative urinary retention
  presenting_complaint: Failure to void following total hip arthroplasty
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female was unable to pass urine 8 hours after the removal of her peri-operative catheter. She had received spinal anaesthesia and was on PCA morphine for pain management. A bladder scan showed 600ml; she was managed with a temporary re-catheterisation and successfully passed a TWOC 24 hours later.

urinary_retention_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute urinary retention secondary to urethral stricture
  presenting_complaint: Straining to void and sudden cessation of flow
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old male with a history of pelvic trauma presented with acute retention. Previous outpatient flow rates had shown a "plateau" pattern suggestive of a stricture. Following failed urethral catheterisation by the SHO, a suprapubic catheter was inserted by the urology registrar, and he was scheduled for an optical urethrotomy.

urinary_retention_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute prostatitis with urinary retention
  presenting_complaint: Perineal pain, fever, and inability to urinate
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male presented with systemic rigors, dysuria, and eventual retention. Digital rectal examination revealed an exquisitely tender, boggy prostate. He was treated with IV gentamicin and ciprofloxacin, and a suprapubic catheter was placed to avoid urethral trauma during the acute inflammatory phase.

urinary_retention_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Posterior urethral valves (PUV)
  presenting_complaint: Poor urinary stream and palpable abdominal mass in a neonate
  summary_of_course: A 2-week-old male infant was referred due to poor feeding and a persistently distended abdomen. Ultrasound showed bilateral hydroureteronephrosis and a thick-walled bladder. A micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG) confirmed posterior urethral valves, which were subsequently treated via endoscopic valve ablation.

urinary_retention_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Medication-induced urinary retention
  presenting_complaint: Confusion and abdominal distension in an elderly patient
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old female was admitted from a nursing home with acute delirium. History revealed she had recently started amitriptyline for neuropathic pain. Examination identified a distended bladder (800ml), and the retention was attributed to the anticholinergic effects of her new medication, which was promptly discontinued.

urinary_retention_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-partum urinary retention
  presenting_complaint: Inability to void 12 hours after instrumental delivery
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old primiparous woman had a prolonged second stage of labour involving a Forceps delivery and epidural analgesia. Post-delivery, she was unable to void despite a palpable bladder. She required an indwelling catheter for 48 hours to allow for the resolution of peri-urethral oedema and bladder desensitisation.

urinary_retention_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic retention secondary to alcohol consumption
  presenting_complaint: Acute painful retention following heavy alcohol intake
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with known mild LUTS presented after a night of heavy drinking. The diuretic effect of alcohol led to rapid bladder filling, stretching the detrusor beyond its functional limit in the setting of pre-existing BPH. He was catheterised (1100ml drained) and listed for an elective TURP.

urinary_retention_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Neurogenic bladder with retention secondary to Multiple Sclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent UTIs and sensation of incomplete emptying
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female with relapsing-remitting MS reported frequent "stop-start" urination. Post-void residual volumes were consistently above 300ml on bladder scanning. Urodynamic studies confirmed detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia, and she was transitioned to a regimen of tamsulosin and CISC three times daily.

urinary_retention_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Malignant bladder outlet obstruction
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss, bone pain, and urinary hesitancy
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male presented with a 3-month history of worsening obstructive symptoms and lower back pain. Bladder scan showed 500ml residual urine, and DRE revealed a hard, nodular prostate. PSA was 450 ng/ml; he was managed with a long-term catheter and referred for palliative hormonal therapy for metastatic prostate cancer.

urinary_retention_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Constipation-induced urinary retention
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal discomfort and decreased urine output
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old frail male in a residential care home presented with overflow incontinence. A plain abdominal X-ray showed significant faecal impaction in the rectum. The resulting mass effect caused extrinsic compression of the bladder neck; the retention resolved completely following aggressive bowel clearance with phosphate enemas.

urinary_retention_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Elsberg Syndrome (Viral Radiculitis)
  presenting_complaint: Acute retention and genital herpes lesions
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male presented with a 2-day history of painful genital vesicles followed by an inability to pass urine. Lumbar puncture showed a lymphocytic pleocytosis, and PCR was positive for HSV-2. He was diagnosed with Elsberg syndrome and required a temporary catheter while receiving IV aciclovir.

urinary_retention_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Bladder stone causing intermittent retention
  presenting_complaint: Sudden "stopping and starting" of the urinary stream
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male reported that his urinary flow would suddenly cut off, accompanied by sharp penile pain. Bedside ultrasound suggested a mobile echogenic focus in the bladder. Cystoscopy confirmed a 3cm uric acid stone acting as a "ball-valve" at the bladder neck, necessitating cystolitholapaxy.

urinary_retention_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Clot retention secondary to haematuria
  presenting_complaint: Severe suprapubic pain and frank haematuria with clots
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male on warfarin presented with gross haematuria and sudden cessation of voiding. A bladder scan showed 600ml, but a standard Foley catheter immediately blocked with blood clots. He required a large-bore 3-way catheter and continuous bladder irrigation (CBI) to evacuate the clots and maintain patency.

urinary_retention_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute urinary retention secondary to retroverted gravid uterus
  presenting_complaint: Pelvic pressure and inability to void at 14 weeks gestation
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant female presented in her second trimester with acute retention. Clinical examination and ultrasound confirmed a retroverted uterus trapped in the pelvic hollow, compressing the urethra. She was treated with catheterisation and knee-chest positioning exercises to encourage the uterus to move into the abdominal cavity.

urinary_retention_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic cystopathy
  presenting_complaint: Chronic painless distension and frequent small voids
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with a 30-year history of poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes presented with a "silent" distended bladder. Urodynamics revealed a large-capacity, hypocontractile detrusor with impaired sensation. He was managed with a chronic indwelling catheter due to poor manual dexterity preventing the use of CISC.

urinary_retention_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Bladder neck contracture
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent urinary retention post-TURP
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male, who underwent a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) six months prior, presented with a return of severe obstructive symptoms. Cystoscopy revealed significant scarring and narrowing at the bladder neck. He underwent an endoscopic bladder neck incision but required long-term follow-up due to the risk of further stenosis.
