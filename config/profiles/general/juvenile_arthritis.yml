juvenile_arthritis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Persistent oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Swollen right knee and morning limp
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old girl presented with a 6-week history of painless swelling in the right knee and a noticeable limp upon waking. Clinical examination confirmed a cool effusion with restricted range of motion; blood tests showed a positive ANA (1:320) but normal ESR. She was diagnosed with persistent oligoarticular JIA and responded well to a single intra-articular corticosteroid injection and physiotherapy.

juvenile_arthritis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA)
  presenting_complaint: Daily spiking fevers and evanescent salmon-pink rash
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old boy presented with three weeks of high daily fevers (up to 40°C), a transient trunk rash, and generalised lymphadenopathy. Investigations revealed significant leucocytosis (WBC 22x10^9/L), thrombocytosis, and a markedly elevated CRP of 145 mg/L. He was started on pulsed methylprednisolone and subsequently transitioned to Anakinra (IL-1 inhibitor) with rapid resolution of systemic features.

juvenile_arthritis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: RF-positive polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Symmetrical pain and swelling in small joints of hands
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old female presented with a 3-month history of stiffness and swelling in her PIP joints, MCP joints, and wrists. Bloods confirmed positive Rheumatoid Factor and anti-CCP antibodies, indicating a more aggressive phenotype. Despite early initiation of Methotrexate, she required the addition of Etanercept to achieve low disease activity and prevent erosive joint damage.

juvenile_arthritis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA)
  presenting_complaint: Heel pain and lower back stiffness
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy presented with bilateral Achilles tendon tenderness and early morning stiffness in the lumbar spine. He was HLA-B27 positive, and MRI of the sacroiliac joints showed early signs of sacroiliitis. He was managed with NSAIDs and Sulfasalazine, with regular monitoring by the paediatric rheumatology multidisciplinary team.

juvenile_arthritis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Juvenile psoriatic arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Swollen "sausage" toe and pitting of finger nails
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old girl presented with dactylitis of the second left toe and asymmetrical swelling of the right ankle. Examination revealed subtle psoriatic plaques behind the ears and significant nail pitting. She was diagnosed with juvenile psoriatic arthritis and commenced on Methotrexate after failing to respond to Naproxen.

juvenile_arthritis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) complicating sJIA
  presenting_complaint: Persistent high fever, bruising, and altered mental status
  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old male with known sJIA was admitted to PICU with a sudden clinical deterioration characterized by non-remitting fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and purpura. Labs showed dramatic falls in ESR, fibrinogen, and platelets, alongside a ferritin level >10,000 ng/mL. He was treated urgently with high-dose Ciclosporin and corticosteroids for life-threatening MAS.

juvenile_arthritis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic anterior uveitis secondary to JIA
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic; detected on routine slit-lamp screening
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old girl with oligoarticular JIA underwent mandatory three-monthly ophthalmology screening. Slit-lamp examination revealed 2+ cells in the anterior chamber despite the patient being entirely asymptomatic with no "red eye." She required intensive topical steroid drops and eventually Adalimumab to control the intraocular inflammation and prevent cataracts.

juvenile_arthritis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Adult-onset Still's Disease (AOSD)
  presenting_complaint: Fever, sore throat, and polyarthritis
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male presented with symptoms identical to sJIA, including a "salmon-pink" rash and high-grade fevers. Diagnostic workup ruled out malignancy and infection, showing a ferritin of 5,000 ng/mL and negative ANA/RF. He was diagnosed with AOSD, representing the adult spectrum of systemic JIA, and responded to Tocilizumab.

juvenile_arthritis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: RF-negative polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Generalised joint pain and fatigue
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old girl presented with involvement of 8 joints, including the knees, ankles, and cervical spine. She was seronegative for RF and ANA, with a moderately raised ESR of 45 mm/hr. Initial treatment with subcutaneous Methotrexate provided partial relief, but persistent active synovitis necessitated a switch to Abatacept.

juvenile_arthritis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: JIA-associated growth retardation and osteopenia
  presenting_complaint: Failure to grow and persistent knee pain
  summary_of_course: An 11-year-old boy with chronic polyarticular JIA showed significant height deceleration, falling from the 50th to the 2nd centile. This complication was attributed to both chronic systemic inflammation and prolonged corticosteroid use. His treatment plan was adjusted to include growth hormone therapy and steroid-sparing biologic agents to improve bone mineral density.

juvenile_arthritis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Extended oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis
  presenting_complaint: New onset swelling in wrists and elbows
  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old boy originally diagnosed with oligoarticular JIA (affecting only the left knee) developed involvement of five additional joints 8 months after the initial diagnosis. This progression to "extended" oligoarticular JIA changed his prognosis and necessitated more aggressive systemic therapy with Methotrexate. He currently remains in clinical remission on medication.

juvenile_arthritis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis mimicking septic arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of hot, red, swollen hip and inability to weight-bear
  summary_of_course: A 2-year-old boy was admitted via A&E with suspected septic arthritis of the right hip, featuring a fever of 38.5°C and high CRP. Joint aspiration revealed a high white cell count but negative cultures; subsequent follow-up and involvement of other joints confirmed an early-onset JIA. He was managed with joint aspiration under GA and subsequent NSAIDs.

juvenile_arthritis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary Amyloidosis (AA) in chronic JIA
  presenting_complaint: Peripheral oedema and proteinuria
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with a history of poorly controlled systemic JIA since childhood presented with nephrotic-range proteinuria. Renal biopsy confirmed AA amyloidosis, a rare but severe complication of long-standing uncontrolled inflammation. Management focused on intensive IL-6 inhibition to halt the progression of renal failure.

juvenile_arthritis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Undifferentiated juvenile idiopathic arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent swelling of the jaw and small joints of the feet
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old girl presented with symptoms that did not clearly meet any single ILAR sub-classification, involving the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and two MTP joints. Despite the lack of a specific subtype, her functional impairment was significant. She was treated as undifferentiated JIA with intra-articular injections to the TMJ and low-dose Methotrexate.

juvenile_arthritis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: JIA-associated with Down's Syndrome (Arthropathy of Down's)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive stiffness and loss of fine motor skills
  summary_of_course: A 9-year-old boy with Trisomy 21 was referred after his parents noticed he could no longer hold a spoon or dress himself. Examination revealed significant, previously unrecognised polyarthritis in the small joints of the hands. Diagnosis is often delayed in this population; he was started on Methotrexate with a significant improvement in his functional abilities.

juvenile_arthritis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent flares despite multiple biologic therapies
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old girl with sJIA failed to achieve remission on Anakinra, Canakinumab, and Tocilizumab. She suffered from frequent flares requiring high-dose oral prednisolone, leading to Cushingoid features and vertebral compression fractures. She is currently being considered for a clinical trial involving JAK inhibitors as a salvage therapy.

juvenile_arthritis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Oligoarticular JIA with secondary leg length discrepancy
  presenting_complaint: Noticeable tilt in pelvis and limping
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old girl with long-standing, under-treated oligoarthritis of the left knee presented with a 1.5 cm leg length overgrowth on the affected side. The chronic hyperaemia of the growth plate led to accelerated bone growth. She required orthopaedic shoe inserts and more robust inflammatory control to prevent further discrepancy.

juvenile_arthritis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Enthesitis-related arthritis with acute anterior uveitis
  presenting_complaint: Painful, red, photophobic eye
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old male with known ERA presented to A&E with a sudden-onset painful red eye, unlike the "silent" uveitis seen in oligoarticular JIA. Diagnosis of HLA-B27 associated acute anterior uveitis was made. He was treated with intensive cycloplegic and steroid drops, and his systemic medication was escalated to Adalimumab to prevent recurrences.

juvenile_arthritis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Polyarticular JIA with cervical spine involvement
  presenting_complaint: Neck pain and restricted rotation
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old girl with RF-negative polyarthritis complained of severe neck stiffness and pain. Lateral X-rays and MRI showed fusion of the C2-C3 facet joints and narrowing of the disc spaces. This high-risk presentation required aggressive biologic therapy and specialized physiotherapy to maintain neck mobility and prevent neurological complications.

juvenile_arthritis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild persistent oligoarticular JIA
  presenting_complaint: Morning stiffness lasting 20 minutes
  summary_of_course: A 13-year-old male presented with a "gelling" sensation in his right ankle after sitting for long periods. Clinical exam showed a mild effusion but no significant loss of function. He was managed conservatively in the community with Naproxen and a home exercise programme, achieving full symptomatic control without the need for DMARDs.
