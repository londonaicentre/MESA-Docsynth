porphyria_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP)
  presenting_complaint: Severe generalized abdominal pain, vomiting, and palpitations.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female presented with an acute neurovisceral crisis triggered by a low-calorie diet. Investigations revealed significantly elevated urinary porphobilinogen (PBG) and hyponatraemia (128 mmol/L). She was treated with intravenous haem arginate and high-carbohydrate intake, resulting in rapid symptom resolution within 48 hours.

porphyria_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Porphyria Cutanea Tarda (PCT)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic blistering and skin fragility on the dorsum of the hands.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with a history of heavy alcohol consumption and Hepatitis C presented with subacute skin lesions and hypertrichosis. Laboratory tests showed elevated urinary uroporphyrins and mildly deranged LFTs. Management involved alcohol cessation, sun protection, and a course of low-dose hydroxychloroquine, leading to gradual skin healing.

porphyria_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Erythropoietic Protoporphyria (EPP)
  presenting_complaint: Intense burning pain and erythema following brief sun exposure.
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old boy presented with severe phototoxicity without blistering, a pattern noted since infancy. Blood tests confirmed markedly elevated free erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels. He was managed with strict UV avoidance and commenced on afamelanotide implants, which significantly improved his sunlight tolerance.

porphyria_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Variegate Porphyria (VP)
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal pain and dark urine associated with new-onset skin erosions.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old woman of South African descent presented with acute-on-chronic symptoms including colicky pain and dorsal hand scarring. Plasma fluorescence scanning showed a characteristic peak at 626 nm. She was stabilized with IV fluids and glucose, and advised on avoiding porphyrinogenic medications.

porphyria_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP)
  presenting_complaint: Ascending paralysis, seizures, and respiratory distress.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female with known AIP suffered a life-threatening attack following the administration of a sulphonamide antibiotic. She required ICU admission for mechanical ventilation due to bulbar involvement and profound motor neuropathy. Following intensive treatment with haem arginate and supportive care, she underwent a prolonged rehabilitation period for residual weakness.

porphyria_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Hereditary Coproporphyria (HCP)
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent abdominal cramping and a blistering skin rash.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male presented with a mixed clinical picture of neurovisceral pain and cutaneous photosensitivity. Faecal analysis demonstrated a massive elevation of coproporphyrin III. The patient was managed as an outpatient with dietary modifications and avoidance of triggers, showing good control of symptoms.

porphyria_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Congenital Erythropoietic Porphyria (CEP)
  presenting_complaint: Severe cutaneous scarring, red-coloured urine, and anaemia.
  summary_of_course: A 4-month-old infant presented with erythrodontia (reddish-brown teeth) and extreme photosensitivity leading to mutilating skin lesions. Investigations confirmed uroporphyrinogen III synthase deficiency and haemolytic anaemia requiring regular transfusions. She is currently being evaluated for a bone marrow transplant as definitive therapy.

porphyria_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Porphyria Cutanea Tarda (PCT)
  presenting_complaint: Fragile skin and small cysts (milia) on the face and hands.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with known hereditary haemochromatosis (C282Y homozygous) developed PCT symptoms. Iron studies showed a ferritin of 1500 ug/L. Treatment focused on therapeutic venesection to reduce iron stores, which successfully induced remission of the cutaneous porphyria symptoms.

porphyria_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent abdominal pain post-appendicectomy.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female underwent an emergency appendicectomy for suspected appendicitis, but the appendix was histologically normal. Post-operative tachycardia and worsening pain prompted a metabolic screen, revealing high urinary PBG. This diagnostic challenge highlighted the importance of considering AIP in "surgical sieve" abdominal pain presentations.

porphyria_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Erythropoietic Protoporphyria (EPP)
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice, pruritus, and right upper quadrant pain.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with long-standing EPP developed acute-on-chronic liver failure due to protoporphyrin deposition in hepatocytes. Biopsy showed characteristic Maltese-cross crystals under polarized light. Despite aggressive biliary drainage and cholestyramine, his condition deteriorated, necessitating an urgent liver transplant.

porphyria_011:
  primary_diagnosis: X-linked Protoporphyria (XLPP)
  presenting_complaint: Severe pain upon light exposure and mild anaemia.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old male presented with symptoms identical to EPP but with significantly higher erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels. Genetic testing identified a gain-of-function mutation in the ALAS2 gene. He responded partially to high-dose beta-carotene and strict photoprotection measures.

porphyria_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent monthly abdominal pain and mood swings.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female experienced cyclical AIP attacks during her luteal phase. After failing GnRH analogue therapy, she was commenced on Givosiran (RNA interference therapy). This resulted in a 90% reduction in annualized attack rate and significantly improved her quality of life.

porphyria_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Porphyria Cutanea Tarda (PCT)
  presenting_complaint: Skin erosions and darkening of the skin (hyperpigmentation).
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female on long-term oestrogen replacement therapy (HRT) developed classic PCT lesions. Cessation of HRT and a short course of low-dose chloroquine led to the normalization of porphyrin levels and resolution of skin fragility within six months.

porphyria_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Variegate Porphyria (VP)
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, limb weakness, and a history of "sun allergy".
  summary_of_course: An elderly woman presented with subacute neuropsychiatric symptoms and proximal muscle weakness. Initial diagnosis was hindered by her age and comorbidities (Type 2 diabetes, hypertension). Detection of the PPOX gene mutation and elevated plasma porphyrins confirmed VP, likely triggered by a recent course of barbiturates for insomnia.

porphyria_015:
  primary_diagnosis: ALAD Deficiency Porphyria (ADP)
  presenting_complaint: Severe neurovisceral crises since early childhood.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy presented with recurrent vomiting and polyneuropathy. Extremely low aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) activity was detected. This ultra-rare autosomal recessive porphyria required meticulous management of triggers and frequent haem arginate infusions during crises.

porphyria_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP)
  presenting_complaint: Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain in early pregnancy.
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old primigravida was initially treated for hyperemesis gravidarum. However, the development of dark urine and hypertension led to the diagnosis of an AIP attack triggered by hormonal changes of pregnancy. She was managed safely with glucose polymers and careful monitoring, delivering a healthy infant at term.

porphyria_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Porphyria Cutanea Tarda (PCT)
  presenting_complaint: Blisters on hands and excessive facial hair growth.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with HIV and chronic alcohol use presented with moderate skin fragility. PCT was diagnosed via urinary porphyrin profile. Management was complicated by his antiretroviral regimen, requiring careful selection of low-dose antimalarials to avoid drug-drug interactions.

porphyria_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Hereditary Coproporphyria (HCP)
  presenting_complaint: Acute psychosis and severe constipation.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male was admitted to a psychiatric ward with paranoid delusions and agitation. The concurrent complaint of severe "boring" abdominal pain led to a medical review. Elevated faecal coproporphyrins confirmed HCP; his psychiatric symptoms resolved completely once the metabolic crisis was treated with IV haem.

porphyria_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic, daily abdominal pain and opiate dependency.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female with refractory AIP experienced "smouldering" symptoms between acute attacks. She had become dependent on high-dose oxycodone and required frequent hospital admissions. She was eventually referred for a specialist multidisciplinary review to consider liver transplantation as a curative option for her intractable symptoms.

porphyria_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Erythropoietic Protoporphyria (EPP)
  presenting_complaint: Mild stinging sensation in sunlight and gallstones.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented with symptomatic cholelithiasis. During the pre-operative assessment, she mentioned a lifelong "sensitivity" to the sun that never caused blisters. Analysis of the gallstones and subsequent blood tests confirmed EPP with protoporphyrin-containing calculi, a late but classic presentation.
