  primary_diagnosis: Symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent renal colic and flank pain.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male presented to A&E with acute left-sided loin pain and haematuria. CT KUB confirmed a 6mm ureteric stone; subsequent biochemistry revealed calcium 2.85 mmol/L and PTH 15.2 pmol/L. He underwent lithotripsy followed by a successful excision of a left superior parathyroid adenoma.

hyperparathyroidism_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypercalcaemic crisis due to primary hyperparathyroidism
  presenting_complaint: Acute confusion, dehydration, and constipation.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female was admitted via ambulance with a reduced GCS and severe dehydration. Laboratory tests showed a life-threatening adjusted calcium of 3.95 mmol/L and PTH of 85 pmol/L. Following aggressive IV fluid resuscitation and bisphosphonate therapy, she underwent emergency neck exploration and removal of a large 3cm cystic parathyroid adenoma.

hyperparathyroidism_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary hyperparathyroidism
  presenting_complaint: Generalized bone pain and pruritus.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with Stage 5 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) on haemodialysis presented with worsening bone pain. Investigations showed a high PTH of 88 pmol/L, low-normal calcium of 2.15 mmol/L, and high phosphate of 2.1 mmol/L. He was treated with phosphate binders and vitamin D analogues (alfacalcidol) to manage the mineral bone disorder.

hyperparathyroidism_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Tertiary hyperparathyroidism
  presenting_complaint: Persistent hypercalcaemia post-renal transplant.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female, two years post-successful renal transplant, demonstrated persistent adjusted calcium of 2.88 mmol/L and PTH of 45 pmol/L. Despite a functioning graft, the parathyroid glands remained autonomously overactive. She was diagnosed with tertiary hyperparathyroidism and underwent a subtotal parathyroidectomy.

hyperparathyroidism_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism
  presenting_complaint: Worsening osteoporosis on DEXA scan.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old female was investigated for a T-score of -3.2 at the lumbar spine despite bisphosphonate therapy. While her adjusted calcium was consistently 2.45 mmol/L, her PTH was elevated at 10.2 pmol/L with normal Vitamin D levels. She was diagnosed with the normocalcaemic variant of PHPT and opted for surgical intervention to preserve bone density.

hyperparathyroidism_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 (MEN1)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent peptic ulcers and lethargy.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male with a family history of pituitary tumours presented with refractory dyspepsia. Investigations confirmed Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and hypercalcaemia (Ca 2.92 mmol/L, PTH 18 pmol/L). Genetic testing confirmed a MEN1 mutation, and imaging showed multi-gland parathyroid hyperplasia requiring four-gland exploration.

hyperparathyroidism_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Parathyroid carcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Palpable neck mass and profound weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male presented with a firm, palpable mass in the right lower neck and severe weight loss. Biochemistry showed an extremely high adjusted calcium of 4.1 mmol/L and PTH of 120 pmol/L. Surgery revealed a locally invasive parathyroid carcinoma requiring en bloc resection and subsequent monitoring for pulmonary metastases.

hyperparathyroidism_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Lithium-induced hyperparathyroidism
  presenting_complaint: Polyuria and polydipsia.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with bipolar affective disorder on long-term lithium therapy presented with symptoms of diabetes insipidus. Bloods revealed an adjusted calcium of 2.78 mmol/L and PTH of 9.5 pmol/L. After consultation with psychiatry, lithium was tapered, but hypercalcaemia persisted, necessitating localized parathyroidectomy for a single adenoma.

hyperparathyroidism_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Hungry bone syndrome post-parathyroidectomy
  presenting_complaint: Perioral tingling and carpopedal spasm.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with severe PHPT and pre-existing high bone turnover underwent successful removal of a parathyroid adenoma. 24 hours post-operatively, his calcium plummeted to 1.85 mmol/L with low phosphate. He required intensive IV calcium gluconate replacement and high-dose Vitamin D for two weeks to manage hungry bone syndrome.

hyperparathyroidism_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary hyperparathyroidism in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Severe hyperemesis and abdominal pain in the second trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old pregnant female (20 weeks gestation) was admitted with intractable vomiting. Initial bloods showed an adjusted calcium of 3.1 mmol/L and PTH of 14 pmol/L. Due to the risk of foetal complications and maternal crisis, she underwent a successful minimally invasive parathyroidectomy under general anaesthesia.

hyperparathyroidism_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcaemia (FHH) - Diagnostic challenge
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic hypercalcaemia found during insurance medical.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old female was referred with a calcium of 2.82 mmol/L and PTH of 7.5 pmol/L. Despite the suspicion of PHPT, her 24-hour urinary calcium-to-creatinine clearance ratio was 0.006. Genetic testing identified a CASR gene mutation, confirming FHH and avoiding unnecessary neck surgery.

hyperparathyroidism_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Ectopic parathyroid adenoma
  presenting_complaint: Persistent hypercalcaemia following failed neck exploration.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male had previously undergone a negative four-gland neck exploration for PHPT. Persistent calcium of 2.90 mmol/L led to a 4D-CT scan, which located a 1.2cm adenoma in the anterior mediastinum. The lesion was successfully removed via a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) approach.

hyperparathyroidism_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Vitamin D deficiency masking primary hyperparathyroidism
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue and low mood.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old female presented with a PTH of 15 pmol/L but a normal calcium of 2.35 mmol/L and a very low Vitamin D (20 nmol/L). Initially treated for secondary HPT with Vitamin D loading, her calcium subsequently rose to 2.85 mmol/L while PTH remained high. This unmasked underlying PHPT, confirmed by a positive ultrasound scan.

hyperparathyroidism_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute pancreatitis secondary to hyperparathyroidism
  presenting_complaint: Severe epigastric pain radiating to the back.
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old male with no history of alcohol excess or gallstones was admitted with acute pancreatitis (amylase 1200 U/L). Admission bloods showed an adjusted calcium of 3.4 mmol/L and PTH of 35 pmol/L. Once the pancreatitis settled, he underwent urgent parathyroidectomy to prevent recurrence.

hyperparathyroidism_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric primary hyperparathyroidism
  presenting_complaint: Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) and lethargy.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old boy presented with hip pain and was diagnosed with SCFE. Routine pre-operative bloods showed a calcium of 3.05 mmol/L and PTH of 22 pmol/L. Further investigation revealed a single parathyroid adenoma; surgical excision led to normalization of calcium and improvement in his systemic symptoms.

hyperparathyroidism_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Osteitis fibrosa cystica (Severe PHPT)
  presenting_complaint: Pathological fracture of the humerus.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female presented with a humeral fracture after minimal trauma. X-rays showed multiple "brown tumours" and subperiosteal resorption. Biochemistry confirmed severe PHPT (Ca 3.2 mmol/L, PTH 95 pmol/L). She underwent parathyroidectomy, which halted the progressive cystic bone destruction.

hyperparathyroidism_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary hyperparathyroidism due to malabsorption
  presenting_complaint: Chronic diarrhoea and proximal muscle weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with undiagnosed Coeliac disease presented with osteomalacia. Investigations showed a low adjusted calcium of 2.05 mmol/L, low Vitamin D, and a compensatory PTH rise to 25 pmol/L. Treatment with a gluten-free diet and calcium/Vitamin D supplementation successfully lowered the PTH levels.

hyperparathyroidism_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent primary hyperparathyroidism
  presenting_complaint: New onset of kidney stones 10 years after surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female, who had a left inferior parathyroidectomy a decade ago, presented with new renal colic. Her calcium was 2.79 mmol/L and PTH was 11.0 pmol/L. A Choline PET-CT identified a new adenoma in the right superior gland, representing a true recurrence rather than a persistence.

hyperparathyroidism_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary hyperparathyroidism with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2A (MEN2A)
  presenting_complaint: Hypertension and a thyroid nodule.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female was found to have a medullary thyroid carcinoma and a phaeochromocytoma. Screening for associated conditions revealed an adjusted calcium of 2.74 mmol/L and PTH of 12.5 pmol/L. She underwent a total thyroidectomy and parathyroid exploration as part of her MEN2A management.
