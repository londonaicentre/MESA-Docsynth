extradural_haemorrhage_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute arterial extradural haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Lucid interval followed by rapid loss of consciousness after a blow to the temple.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male was struck by a cricket ball, initially remaining conscious (GCS 15) before collapsing 2 hours later (GCS 7, right blown pupil). CT head revealed a large biconvex hyperdense collection in the right temporoparietal region with significant midline shift and a temporal bone fracture. He underwent emergency craniotomy for evacuation of the haematoma and ligation of the middle meningeal artery, resulting in a full neurological recovery.

extradural_haemorrhage_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute venous extradural haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Persistent worsening headache and nausea three days after a minor fall.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female presented to A&E with a 72-hour history of escalating retro-orbital pain following a fall during netball. CT imaging demonstrated a stable, 12mm biconvex haematoma over the vertex, likely venous in origin due to proximity to the superior sagittal sinus. She was managed conservatively with serial neuro-imaging and analgesia, showing gradual resorption of the clot over six weeks.

extradural_haemorrhage_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Posterior fossa extradural haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Occipital headache, vomiting, and ataxia following a fall onto the back of the head.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy fell from a climbing frame, sustaining an occipital bone fracture. He developed progressive cerebellar signs and decreased level of consciousness (GCS 11) four hours post-injury. CT showed a large extradural haematoma in the posterior fossa compressing the fourth ventricle and causing early hydrocephalus, requiring urgent surgical evacuation and EVD placement.

extradural_haemorrhage_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic extradural haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Dull, persistent headache and mild cognitive slowing for two weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension presented with a two-week history of "fogginess" following a minor head bump. CT head revealed an isodense biconvex collection with a thick peripheral membrane, consistent with a chronic extradural haemorrhage. Due to the lack of mass effect and stable GCS 15, he was managed with close outpatient observation and repeat imaging.

extradural_haemorrhage_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic extradural haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Sudden collapse and seizure in a patient with a pre-existing stable head injury.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male, previously diagnosed with a small, conservative EDH two weeks prior, suffered a secondary minor trauma. He presented with a GCS of 9 and a tonic-clonic seizure; repeat CT showed fresh hyperdense blood within the existing isodense collection. He underwent urgent burr-hole drainage and craniotomy to control a secondary bleed from a dural vessel.

extradural_haemorrhage_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Small asymptomatic extradural haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Scalp laceration and local tenderness after an assault.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male was brought to A&E after being hit with a glass bottle. While neurologically intact (GCS 15), a routine CT head for a palpable skull fracture identified a 4mm thick extradural haematoma without mass effect. He was admitted for 24 hours of neurological observation and discharged with outpatient follow-up, as the haematoma remained stable.

extradural_haemorrhage_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Extradural haemorrhage with uncal herniation
  presenting_complaint: Comatose state and bradycardia following a high-speed motor vehicle accident.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female was intubated at the scene with a GCS of 3 and signs of Cushing's triad (hypertension, bradycardia, irregular respirations). CT head showed a massive 45ml temporal EDH with 15mm midline shift and uncal herniation. Despite rapid surgical decompression within 60 minutes of arrival, she remained in a persistent vegetative state due to secondary brainstem ischaemia.

extradural_haemorrhage_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Bilateral acute extradural haemorrhages
  presenting_complaint: Severe headache and fluctuating consciousness after a fall from height.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old construction worker fell 3 metres, landing on his vertex. CT imaging revealed bilateral frontal biconvex haematomas associated with a complex skull base fracture. He required bilateral craniotomies for evacuation; his post-operative course was complicated by frontal lobe syndrome and significant executive dysfunction.

extradural_haemorrhage_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Extradural haemorrhage in an anticoagulated patient
  presenting_complaint: Confusion and left-sided weakness after a low-energy fall at home.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male on Warfarin for atrial fibrillation (INR 3.2) presented with progressive hemiparesis. CT showed a right parietal EDH; management was complicated by the need for rapid anticoagulation reversal using Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (PCC) and Vitamin K. He underwent successful evacuation but required prolonged rehabilitation for residual motor deficits.

extradural_haemorrhage_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric extradural haemorrhage (venous)
  presenting_complaint: Irritability and bulging fontanelle in an infant.
  summary_of_course: A 10-month-old infant was brought in after falling from a sofa. Clinical examination noted a tense fontanelle and sunsetting eyes; CT head confirmed a large venous EDH originating from the torcular herophili. Due to the infant's physiological compensation, he remained stable and was managed with intensive monitoring in the PICU without surgical intervention.

extradural_haemorrhage_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Spinal extradural haemorrhage (spontaneous)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset severe back pain followed by rapid paraplegia.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female on aspirin presented with "thunderclap" thoracic back pain and loss of sensation below the T10 level. MRI spine revealed a posterior spinal extradural haematoma extending from T8 to T11 causing cord compression. Emergency decompressive laminectomy was performed within 6 hours, leading to significant but incomplete motor recovery.

extradural_haemorrhage_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Vertex extradural haemorrhage with venous sinus thrombosis
  presenting_complaint: Severe headache and papilloedema.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male presented with a 5-day history of worsening headache following a head injury. CT venogram showed a vertex EDH associated with a fracture crossing the superior sagittal sinus, which was partially thrombosed. Management involved balancing the risk of haematoma expansion against the need for anticoagulation for the sinus thrombosis; he was ultimately managed with close observation and delayed antiplatelet therapy.

extradural_haemorrhage_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Extradural haemorrhage with delayed presentation
  presenting_complaint: New onset seizure 48 hours after a seemingly minor head injury.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old student was punched in the face and initially felt fine, but suffered a focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic seizure two days later. CT showed a 15mm thick temporal EDH that had likely developed slowly from a low-pressure venous source. He was treated with levetiracetam and underwent elective craniotomy to prevent further expansion.

extradural_haemorrhage_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Extradural haemorrhage with associated diffuse axonal injury (DAI)
  presenting_complaint: Immediate unconsciousness following a motorcycle crash.
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old male presented with a GCS of 6. While CT showed a moderate 15ml frontal EDH, the degree of neurological impairment was disproportionate to the mass effect. Subsequent MRI confirmed extensive diffuse axonal injury (DAI) in the corpus callosum; despite surgical evacuation of the EDH, the patient had a poor neurological prognosis due to the underlying white matter damage.

extradural_haemorrhage_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent extradural haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Neurological deterioration 12 hours after initial haematoma evacuation.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male underwent craniotomy for an acute EDH. Post-operatively, he initially improved to GCS 15 but then dropped to GCS 10 in the recovery room. Repeat CT showed a recurrent haematoma at the surgical site due to an overlooked bleeding point in the diploic veins of the skull vault, requiring immediate re-operation and bone wax application.

extradural_haemorrhage_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Extradural haemorrhage with coagulopathy (liver disease)
  presenting_complaint: Coma following a fall in a patient with known cirrhosis.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis and a platelet count of 40x10^9/L presented with a large EDH. His management was high-risk due to profound coagulopathy (INR 2.1); he received multiple units of FFP and platelets prior to emergency neurosurgery. The patient survived the surgery but developed post-operative pneumonia and multi-organ failure in the ICU.

extradural_haemorrhage_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Frontal extradural haemorrhage with personality change
  presenting_complaint: Disinhibited behaviour and apathy following a fall.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female was brought by family due to "strange" behaviour for three days. CT head showed a large, subacute bilateral frontal EDH compressing the prefrontal cortex. Following surgical drainage, her personality returned to baseline, though she required ongoing support for minor memory deficits.

extradural_haemorrhage_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Extradural haemorrhage masked by intoxication
  presenting_complaint: Found down with high blood alcohol levels and presumed "drunk."
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male was admitted to a "sobering up" unit, but failed to wake up after 8 hours. Upon transfer to A&E, a CT head revealed a massive temporal EDH with midline shift. The delay in diagnosis due to the confounding effect of alcohol resulted in significant ischaemic brain injury despite subsequent decompression.

extradural_haemorrhage_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Extradural haemorrhage in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Severe headache and vomiting after a domestic incident at 32 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old pregnant female presented with a GCS of 13 and a temporal skull fracture. CT head (with abdominal shielding) confirmed a 20ml EDH. A multidisciplinary team (neurosurgery, obstetrics, and anaesthetics) performed a successful craniotomy while monitoring the foetus; the pregnancy continued to term without further complications.

extradural_haemorrhage_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Extradural haemorrhage with CSF rhinorrhoea
  presenting_complaint: Clear fluid leaking from the nose after a head injury.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male presented with a frontal skull fracture and a small EDH. He also noted persistent clear drainage from his right nostril, which tested positive for beta-2 transferrin. The EDH was managed conservatively, but he required a subsequent endoscopic endonasal repair of a dural tear to resolve the CSF leak and prevent meningitis.
