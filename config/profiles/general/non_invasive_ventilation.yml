  primary_diagnosis: Acute exacerbation of COPD
  presenting_complaint: Worsening breathlessness, productive cough, and drowsiness.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male smoker with known GOLD stage IV COPD presented with acute type 2 respiratory failure (pH 7.24, pCO2 9.2 kPa). He was commenced on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) in the emergency department with pressures of 14/4 cmH2O. Over 24 hours, his acidosis resolved, and he was successfully weaned to nasal oxygen on the respiratory ward.

non_invasive_ventilation_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset orthopnoea and pink frothy sputum.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female with a history of ischaemic heart disease presented in extremis with flash pulmonary oedema and hypoxia (SpO2 82% on air). Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at 10 cmH2O was initiated alongside intravenous furosemide. Her respiratory rate decreased from 36 to 22 within two hours, and CPAP was discontinued after six hours of clinical stability.

non_invasive_ventilation_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS)
  presenting_complaint: Excessive daytime somnolence and morning headaches.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male with a BMI of 52 kg/m2 was referred for sleep studies which confirmed Pickwickian syndrome with chronic hypercapnia (pCO2 6.8 kPa). He was established on nocturnal home NIV (BiPAP) with a back-up rate. At three-month follow-up, he reported significant improvement in cognitive function and a reduction in daytime CO2 levels.

non_invasive_ventilation_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Motor neurone disease (MND)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive limb weakness and nocturnal breathlessness.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) demonstrated a falling forced vital capacity (FVC) of 45% predicted. Nocturnal NIV was initiated to manage symptomatic hypoventilation and improve quality of life. She successfully uses a nasal mask for 7 hours per night, which has stabilised her overnight oxygen saturations.

non_invasive_ventilation_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe paediatric bronchiolitis
  presenting_complaint: Poor feeding, intercostal recession, and apnoeic episodes.
  summary_of_course: An 8-month-old infant was admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with RSV-positive bronchiolitis. Due to increasing work of breathing and moderate respiratory acidosis, he was placed on paediatric CPAP at 7 cmH2O via a hood interface. He remained on CPAP for four days before transitioning to high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and eventual discharge.

non_invasive_ventilation_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Kyphoscoliosis-related restrictive lung disease
  presenting_complaint: Chronic fatigue and recurrent chest infections.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old female with severe childhood-onset kyphoscoliosis presented with acute-on-chronic type 2 respiratory failure. She was stabilised with hospital-based BiPAP and subsequently transitioned to a long-term home ventilation programme. Despite her chest wall deformity, she maintains adequate alveolar ventilation with nocturnal support.

non_invasive_ventilation_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Cystic fibrosis (CF) exacerbation
  presenting_complaint: Increased sputum volume, pleuritic pain, and exhaustion.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male with CF and end-stage lung disease was admitted with a pulmonary exacerbation. NIV was used as a bridge to lung transplantation to assist with the work of breathing and facilitate airway clearance. He used BiPAP intermittently during the day and continuously overnight for two weeks until his condition stabilised with intravenous antibiotics.

non_invasive_ventilation_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-operative respiratory failure
  presenting_complaint: Hypoxia and basal atelectasis following laparotomy.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male underwent emergency bowel resection and developed post-operative sputum retention and basal collapse. CPAP was applied for 4-hour cycles to recruit alveoli and improve oxygenation (P/F ratio <200). This intervention prevented the need for re-intubation, and he was stepped down to the surgical ward after 48 hours.

non_invasive_ventilation_009:
  primary_diagnosis: End-stage lung cancer (Palliative)
  presenting_complaint: Distressing dyspnoea at rest.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the lung was admitted for end-of-life care. NIV was used as a ceiling of treatment to provide symptomatic relief from breathlessness, allowing him to communicate with his family. The NIV was discontinued after 24 hours as part of a planned transition to purely pharmacological comfort measures.

non_invasive_ventilation_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)
  presenting_complaint: Witnessed apnoeas and loud snoring.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old taxi driver with an Epworth Sleepiness Scale score of 19/24 underwent an overnight sleep study showing an AHI of 45/hour. He was titrated on CPAP via a full-face mask, achieving an optimal pressure of 12 cmH2O. Compliance has been excellent, and his repeat sleep study showed an AHI reduction to 4/hour.

non_invasive_ventilation_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP)
  presenting_complaint: Dry cough, fever, and profound exertional desaturation.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male with newly diagnosed HIV presented with severe hypoxia (pO2 7.1 kPa on 15L O2). He was managed in the high dependency unit (HDU) with continuous CPAP at 12 cmH2O and 60% FiO2 to avoid invasive ventilation. After 5 days of co-trimoxazole and steroids, his oxygen requirements decreased, allowing weaning from CPAP.

non_invasive_ventilation_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Traumatic flail chest
  presenting_complaint: Severe chest wall pain and paradoxical breathing following an RTA.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male sustained multiple rib fractures (4-9) and a pulmonary contusion. To provide internal pneumatic splinting and improve lung compliance, he was started on CPAP at 8 cmH2O alongside a thoracic epidural for analgesia. This strategy successfully managed his respiratory mechanics without the need for mechanical ventilation.

non_invasive_ventilation_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)
  presenting_complaint: Morning grogginess and reduced vital capacity.
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old boy with DMD showed evidence of nocturnal hypoventilation on pulse oximetry (T90 >10%). He was electively started on nocturnal NIV using a volume-assured pressure support (VAPS) mode. He initially struggled with mask comfort but was successfully desensitised using a nasal pillows interface.

non_invasive_ventilation_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening acute asthma (Treatment Failure)
  presenting_complaint: Silent chest, exhaustion, and rising pCO2.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female presented with a severe asthma attack refractory to nebulisers and IV magnesium. A trial of NIV was attempted in the ICU as a temporising measure, but she became increasingly agitated and hypercapnic (pH 7.12). The NIV was abandoned, and she was urgently intubated and ventilated for 48 hours.

non_invasive_ventilation_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-extubation stridor
  presenting_complaint: Inspiratory wheeze and respiratory distress following ICU discharge.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female was extubated after a prolonged ICU stay for sepsis. She developed laryngeal oedema and stridor; a trial of CPAP with heliox was initiated to reduce the work of breathing and bypass the upper airway resistance. This, combined with IV dexamethasone, resolved the obstruction over 12 hours.

non_invasive_ventilation_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Bilateral diaphragmatic palsy
  presenting_complaint: Severe orthopnoea; unable to lie flat.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male presented with unexplained breathlessness when supine. Sniff tests and EMG confirmed bilateral diaphragmatic weakness. He was started on nocturnal NIV, which allowed him to sleep horizontally for the first time in months and resolved his secondary polycythaemia.

non_invasive_ventilation_017:
  primary_diagnosis: COVID-19 pneumonitis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent hypoxia and bilateral infiltrates on CXR.
  summary_of_course: During the pandemic, a 58-year-old female with moderate ARDS was managed on a dedicated respiratory support unit. She received CPAP at 10 cmH2O with an FiO2 of 0.5 for 18 hours a day over a 6-day period. She was successfully weaned to low-flow oxygen and avoided intubation despite a high initial work of breathing.

non_invasive_ventilation_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Non-CF bronchiectasis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent hospitalisations with type 2 respiratory failure.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female with idiopathic bronchiectasis and chronic hypercapnia was frequently admitted for NIV. To reduce hospital bed days, she was set up with a home BiPAP machine for use during exacerbations and 4 hours every night. In the subsequent year, her admission rate fell from six per year to one.

non_invasive_ventilation_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Cervical spinal cord injury (C5)
  presenting_complaint: Weak cough and basal pneumonia.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male with tetraplegia following a diving accident required NIV to assist with nocturnal hypoventilation and secretion management. He used NIV in conjunction with a cough assist device (mechanical insufflation-exsufflation). This combined approach prevented further episodes of pneumonia and improved his daytime energy levels.

non_invasive_ventilation_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute NIV intolerance in delirium
  presenting_complaint: Agitation and pulling at medical devices.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with an acute exacerbation of COPD and underlying dementia developed hypercapnic encephalopathy. Despite the clinical need for BiPAP (pH 7.21), he was unable to tolerate the mask due to distress and claustrophobia. After a multidisciplinary discussion regarding his ceiling of care, he was managed with high-flow nasal oxygen and low-dose morphine for symptom control.
