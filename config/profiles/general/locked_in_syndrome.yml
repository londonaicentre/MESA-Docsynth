locked_in_syndrome_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Classic Locked-In Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset tetraplegia and inability to speak following collapse.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with untreated hypertension suffered an acute basilar artery occlusion. Despite mechanical thrombectomy, he developed classic LIS with total paralysis of all voluntary muscles except for vertical eye movements and blinking. He is currently managed in the ICU, communicating via a letter board and eye-tracking technology.

locked_in_syndrome_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Incomplete Locked-In Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Weakness in all limbs and loss of speech following a flu-like illness.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female presented with subacute progression of quadriparesis over 48 hours. MRI Brain revealed central pontine myelinolysis secondary to rapid correction of profound hyponatraemia. She retains some flickering movement in her left index finger alongside vertical eye movements, classifying it as incomplete LIS.

locked_in_syndrome_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Total Locked-In Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Unresponsive state following severe traumatic brain injury.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male sustained a high-velocity RTA resulting in a primary brainstem shear injury. Initially diagnosed as being in a vegetative state, EEG and PET imaging confirmed preserved cortical wakefulness despite a total lack of any voluntary motor output, including eye movements. This represents the most severe "total" form of LIS.

locked_in_syndrome_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Locked-In Syndrome with Respiratory Complication
  presenting_complaint: Increased secretions and fever in a patient with known LIS.
  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old male, 8 years post-pontine haemorrhage, was admitted from a specialist nursing home with aspiration pneumonia. He has stable chronic LIS and uses a tracheostomy for ventilation. Treatment involved IV antibiotics and chest physiotherapy, with a return to his baseline neurological status.

locked_in_syndrome_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Locked-In Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Sudden loss of motor function following a neck injury.
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old girl suffered a vertebral artery dissection after a gymnastic accident, leading to a ventral pontine infarction. She presented with acute tetraplegia and aphonia but remained fully conscious. She is currently undergoing intensive paediatric rehabilitation focusing on assistive communication devices.

locked_in_syndrome_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Locked-In Syndrome secondary to Pontine Glioma
  presenting_complaint: Progressive double vision, slurred speech, and limb weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female presented with subacute neurological decline over three weeks. Neuroimaging confirmed a high-grade pontine glioma infiltrating the ventral pons. She transitioned into LIS over 10 days and is now receiving palliative radiotherapy and dexamethasone to manage tumour-associated oedema.

locked_in_syndrome_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Pseudo-Locked-In Syndrome (Fulminant GBS)
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly ascending paralysis and respiratory failure.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male presented with a 24-hour history of total paralysis, including cranial nerves, mimicking LIS. Nerve conduction studies confirmed a fulminant axonal variant of Guillain-Barré Syndrome. While clinically "locked in," the pathology is peripheral rather than a brainstem lesion, and he showed gradual recovery after IVIG and plasmapheresis.

locked_in_syndrome_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Locked-In Syndrome with Depression
  presenting_complaint: Withdrawal from communication and refusal of enteral feeding.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male with classic LIS of two years' duration (post-ischaemic stroke) presented with signs of severe clinical depression. He became non-compliant with his eye-gaze communication system. Psychiatric consultation and initiation of liquid mirtazapine via PEG tube resulted in improved engagement with his care team.

locked_in_syndrome_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic Locked-In Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Reduced level of consciousness and hypotension.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female with long-standing LIS due to a previous cavernoma bleed presented with urosepsis. The systemic infection caused a metabolic encephalopathy, temporarily obscuring her "locked-in" status by impairing her vertical eye movements. She required ICU admission for vasopressor support before returning to her neurological baseline.

locked_in_syndrome_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Locked-In Syndrome (Vascular Malformation)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden "thunderclap" headache followed by paralysis.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female experienced a rupture of a pontine Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM). Urgent neurosurgery was required to evacuate the haematoma, but the destruction of the ventral pontine tracts resulted in LIS. She remains in a high-dependency unit, using a blink-coded system for basic needs.

locked_in_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Incomplete Locked-In Syndrome (Post-Surgical)
  presenting_complaint: Failure to mobilise or speak following posterior fossa surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male underwent resection of an acoustic neuroma; post-operative oedema caused compression of the ventral pons. He exhibited LIS symptoms for 72 hours post-surgery. With aggressive steroid treatment, he regained minimal horizontal eye movement and slight head rotation, transitioning to an incomplete LIS profile.

locked_in_syndrome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Locked-In Syndrome (Diagnostic Challenge)
  presenting_complaint: Presumed coma following drug overdose and hypoxic event.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male was initially managed as being in a persistent vegetative state following a suicide attempt. A vigilant nurse noticed the patient's eyes following her around the room. Subsequent neurology review and MRI confirmed a localized infarct in the pons, revealing the patient was actually in a state of LIS.

locked_in_syndrome_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Locked-In Syndrome (Infectious Aetiology)
  presenting_complaint: Fever, headache, and rapid neurological collapse.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with poorly controlled diabetes developed Listeria monocytogenes rhombencephalitis. The infection caused extensive necrosis of the pontine base. Despite appropriate antibiotic therapy (Amoxicillin and Gentamicin), he was left with permanent LIS and requires long-term ventilatory support.

locked_in_syndrome_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Locked-In Syndrome with Thrombolysis Failure
  presenting_complaint: Acute vertigo and ataxia progressing to quadriplegia.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male presented within the 4.5-hour window for thrombolysis after a basilar artery stroke. IV Alteplase was administered, but follow-up angiography showed no recanalisation. He subsequently stabilized but remained in a classic LIS state, highlighting the limitations of medical reperfusion in large vessel occlusions.

locked_in_syndrome_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Locked-In Syndrome (Community Setting)
  presenting_complaint: Routine review of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) utility.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female, 10 years post-stroke, lives in a modified home environment. She is a "success story" of chronic LIS management, using an advanced BCI to write a blog and manage her finances. Her clinical status is stable, with no recent hospital admissions or pressure sores.

locked_in_syndrome_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Locked-In Syndrome with Autonomic Dysreflexia
  presenting_complaint: Profuse sweating, hypertension, and bradycardia.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male with traumatic LIS presented with an acute autonomic crisis. Investigation revealed an ingrown toenail causing noxious stimuli below the level of the lesion. Treatment of the nail and temporary antihypertensives resolved the symptoms, illustrating the complex physiological monitoring required in LIS.

locked_in_syndrome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Locked-In Syndrome (Mitochondrial Disease)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive motor loss in a teenager.
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old male with Leigh Syndrome developed bilateral pontine lesions during a metabolic crisis. This resulted in a subacute onset of LIS over several days. Due to the underlying progressive nature of his mitochondrial disorder, his prognosis is poor, and care is focused on comfort and family communication.

locked_in_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Locked-In Syndrome (End-of-Life Decision)
  presenting_complaint: Request for withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with classic LIS (post-basilar stroke) and comorbid COPD requested the withdrawal of his ventilator via his eye-gaze device. A formal mental capacity assessment confirmed he understood the consequences of his decision. Following legal and ethical review, he was moved to a hospice for terminal weaning and palliative care.

locked_in_syndrome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Incomplete Locked-In Syndrome (Traumatic)
  presenting_complaint: Quadriplegia following a fall from height.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male sustained a cervical spine fracture and a concomitant small pontine contusion. While the spinal injury contributed to paralysis, the pontine lesion resulted in aphonia and facial diplegia. He retains some jaw movement and vertical eye tracking, allowing for a hybrid communication strategy using both.

locked_in_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Locked-In Syndrome with Recurrent PE
  presenting_complaint: Sudden desaturation and pleuritic chest pain (indicated via eye signals).
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with chronic LIS and multiple comorbidities (AF, T2DM) developed a pulmonary embolism despite prophylactic anticoagulation. He successfully communicated his chest pain through a pre-arranged blinking code. He was treated with therapeutic low-molecular-weight heparin and survived the acute event.
