The drug was ceased, and a long course of oral prednisolone was initiated, resulting in partial recovery of lung function.

toxicity_from_medication_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute salicylate poisoning
  presenting_complaint: Tinnitus, hyperventilation, and sweating.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male ingested an unknown quantity of aspirin. Arterial blood gas revealed a mixed respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap. Treatment involved urinary alkalinisation with sodium bicarbonate and repeated doses of activated charcoal, preventing the need for haemodialysis.

toxicity_from_medication_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Decreased level of consciousness and seizures.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female was brought to A&E after an amitriptyline overdose. Her ECG showed a QRS duration of 140ms and a prominent R wave in aVR. She was intubated for airway protection and received boluses of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate to narrow the QRS complex, successfully preventing cardiac arrhythmias.

toxicity_from_medication_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute paediatric iron toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Severe vomiting, haematemesis, and lethargy.
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old boy accidentally ingested his mother's ferrous sulphate tablets. Abdominal X-ray showed multiple radio-opaque tablets in the stomach. He developed metabolic acidosis and was treated with intravenous desferrioxamine chelation therapy, leading to a gradual decline in serum iron levels and clinical stabilisation.

  primary_diagnosis: Chronic cyclosporine nephrotoxicity
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic rise in serum creatinine and hypertension.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male, five years post-renal transplant, showed a steady decline in graft function. Renal biopsy demonstrated characteristic striped interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy consistent with chronic calcineurin inhibitor toxicity. His immunosuppression was switched from cyclosporine to tacrolimus, which stabilised his renal function.

toxicity_from_medication_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute isoniazid toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Refractory status epilepticus.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female on TB treatment presented with generalized tonic-clonic seizures that were non-responsive to lorazepam and phenytoin. Suspicion of isoniazid overdose led to the administration of 5g of intravenous pyridoxine (Vitamin B6). The seizures ceased immediately following the pyridoxine infusion, and her metabolic acidosis subsequently resolved.

toxicity_from_medication_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Baclofen toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Respiratory depression, flaccid paralysis, and coma.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with an intrathecal baclofen pump for spasticity presented with acute toxicity due to a pump malfunction.
