hypopituitarism_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Pituitary apoplexy
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset "thunderclap" headache and bilateral vision loss
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented acutely with severe headache, nausea, and bitemporal hemianopia. Urgent MRI revealed a haemorrhagic infarction of a previously unknown pituitary macroadenoma. He was stabilised with intravenous hydrocortisone and underwent emergency transsphenoidal decompression, resulting in permanent panhypopituitarism requiring lifelong hormone replacement.

hypopituitarism_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Sheehan's syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Failure to lactate and persistent amenorrhoea following childbirth
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old female experienced massive obstetric haemorrhage during delivery six months ago. She reported profound lethargy, cold intolerance, and inability to breastfeed. Investigations confirmed low fT4, low cortisol, and suppressed gonadotropins, consistent with post-partum pituitary necrosis.

hypopituitarism_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Isolated growth hormone deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Growth failure and delayed bone age
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy was referred for height below the 0.4th centile despite normal birth weight. Insulin tolerance testing (ITT) demonstrated a peak GH of 2.1 μg/L, confirming deficiency. MRI brain showed a small anterior pituitary gland, and he commenced daily somatropin injections with good catch-up growth.

hypopituitarism_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Checkpoint inhibitor-induced hypophysitis
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue, anorexia, and mild headache
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female with metastatic melanoma treated with Ipilimumab developed subacute fatigue and hyponatraemia (Na 128 mmol/L). Endocrine workup showed secondary adrenal insufficiency and central hypothyroidism. MRI showed diffuse pituitary enlargement, and she was started on replacement hydrocortisone and levothyroxine.

hypopituitarism_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-traumatic hypopituitarism
  presenting_complaint: Loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, and lack of energy
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old male presented two years after a severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) from a road traffic accident. Biochemical screening revealed low testosterone (4.2 nmol/L) with inappropriately low LH/FSH and borderline low IGF-1. He responded well to testosterone gel and reported significant improvement in mood and vitality.

hypopituitarism_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary adrenal crisis
  presenting_complaint: Hypotension, vomiting, and confusion during an acute infection
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with known panhypopituitarism secondary to a non-functioning adenoma presented to A&E with suspected urosepsis. He had failed to increase his "sick day" hydrocortisone dose, leading to acute-on-chronic adrenal insufficiency. He required aggressive fluid resuscitation and parenteral hydrocortisone in the HDU.

hypopituitarism_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Lymphocytic hypophysitis
  presenting_complaint: Polyuria, polydipsia, and frontal headache in late pregnancy
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female in her third trimester developed sudden onset thirst and excessive urination. Investigations confirmed cranial diabetes insipidus and partial anterior pituitary failure. MRI showed a thickened pituitary stalk, and she was managed with desmopressin and prednisolone for suspected autoimmune hypophysitis.

hypopituitarism_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Craniopharyngioma-related panhypopituitarism
  presenting_complaint: Visual field defects and delayed puberty
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old girl presented with primary amenorrhoea and worsening peripheral vision. Imaging identified a cystic suprasellar mass compressing the optic chiasm. Following subtotal resection and radiotherapy, she developed complete panhypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus, requiring complex multi-hormone replacement therapy.

hypopituitarism_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Empty sella syndrome with mild hypopituitarism
  presenting_complaint: Chronic fatigue and incidental finding on MRI
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female underwent MRI for investigation of persistent vertigo, which revealed a flattened pituitary gland within an enlarged sella turcica. Subsequent dynamic testing showed a suboptimal cortisol response to synacthen and low IGF-1. She was started on low-dose hydrocortisone, which improved her daily functioning.

hypopituitarism_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Infiltrative hypopituitarism (Sarcoidosis)
  presenting_complaint: Thirst, lethargy, and dry cough
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male with known systemic sarcoidosis presented with new-onset polyuria. Investigations confirmed central diabetes insipidus and secondary hypogonadism. Pituitary MRI showed nodular thickening of the infundibulum, and symptoms partially improved with systemic corticosteroids and hormone replacement.

hypopituitarism_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Septo-optic dysplasia (de Morsier syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Nystagmus and neonatal hypoglycaemia
  summary_of_course: A neonate presented with recurrent hypoglycaemic episodes and small optic discs on ophthalmoscopy. MRI confirmed absence of the septum pellucidum and pituitary stalk interruption. The infant was diagnosed with multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies (GH, ACTH, and TSH) and commenced on life-sustaining replacement.

hypopituitarism_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-radiotherapy hypopituitarism
  presenting_complaint: Gradual onset of weight gain and mental fogginess
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male who received cranial irradiation 10 years prior for a nasopharyngeal carcinoma presented with subacute symptoms. Screening showed a low fT4 with a non-elevated TSH and low IGF-1. This highlights the long-term risk of pituitary dysfunction following head and neck radiotherapy, requiring lifelong surveillance.

hypopituitarism_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Macroprolactinoma-induced hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
  presenting_complaint: Galactorrhoea and secondary amenorrhoea
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female presented with milky nipple discharge and cessation of menses for 12 months. Prolactin was severely elevated (45,000 mIU/L), and MRI showed a 2.5cm adenoma compressing the normal pituitary tissue. Treatment with Cabergoline successfully reduced the tumour size and restored the pituitary-gonadal axis.

hypopituitarism_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Pituitary iron overload (Haemochromatosis)
  presenting_complaint: Joint pain, skin bronzing, and loss of libido
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with hereditary haemochromatosis presented with symptoms of androgen deficiency. Investigations confirmed low testosterone and inappropriately low gonadotropins due to iron deposition in the gonadotroph cells. Despite venesection therapy, the hypogonadism remained permanent, requiring testosterone replacement.

hypopituitarism_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary hypothyroidism (Isolated)
  presenting_complaint: Profound lethargy and bradycardia
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female was initially treated for depression before a thyroid panel revealed an fT4 of 7.2 pmol/L with a TSH of 1.2 mU/L. The lack of TSH elevation pointed to a central cause. Further imaging revealed a small non-functioning pituitary microadenoma, and her symptoms resolved entirely with levothyroxine.

hypopituitarism_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic hypopituitarism post-surgery
  presenting_complaint: Post-operative polyuria and hypotension
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male underwent transsphenoidal resection of a large growth-hormone secreting adenoma. Post-operatively, he developed transient diabetes insipidus and acute ACTH deficiency. While the DI resolved within a week, the ACTH and TSH deficiencies persisted, necessitating long-term hydrocortisone and thyroxine.

hypopituitarism_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Kallmann syndrome (Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism)
  presenting_complaint: Failure to enter puberty and inability to smell
  summary_of_course: An 18-year-old male presented with prepubertal features and anosmia. Genetic testing and MRI confirmed a diagnosis of Kallmann syndrome with an absent olfactory bulb. He was treated with pulsatile GnRH therapy to induce puberty and promote future fertility.

hypopituitarism_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe hyponatremia secondary to hypopituitarism
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, gait instability, and falls
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female was admitted with a serum sodium of 118 mmol/L. Initially misdiagnosed as SIADH, further testing revealed secondary adrenal insufficiency (9am cortisol <50 nmol/L). The hyponatraemia corrected rapidly following hydrocortisone initiation, illustrating the importance of excluding hypopituitarism in elderly patients with hyponatremia.

hypopituitarism_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Histiocytosis X (Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis)
  presenting_complaint: Excessive thirst and bone pain
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy presented with diabetes insipidus and a lytic lesion in the femur. Biopsy confirmed LCH, and pituitary MRI showed loss of the posterior pituitary "bright spot" and stalk thickening. He required desmopressin and chemotherapy, with subsequent development of GH deficiency.

hypopituitarism_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Treatment-resistant hypopituitarism
  presenting_complaint: Persistent fatigue despite "normal" replacement levels
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female with known panhypopituitarism complained of poor quality of life despite standard doses of hydrocortisone and levothyroxine. Switching from standard hydrocortisone to a modified-release formulation and optimising her fT4 to the upper quartile of the reference range eventually led to symptomatic improvement.
