carcinoid_syndrome_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Classic carcinoid syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Episodic facial flushing and watery diarrhoea
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male presented with a 6-month history of "dry" flushing and 4-6 episodes of non-bloody diarrhoea daily. Investigations revealed elevated 24-hour urinary 5-HIAA and multiple hypervascular liver metastases on CT. He was diagnosed with a midgut neuroendocrine tumour and started on monthly Lanreotide injections, resulting in significant symptomatic improvement.

carcinoid_syndrome_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Carcinoid heart disease
  presenting_complaint: Progressive breathlessness and peripheral oedema
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female with known metastatic ileal carcinoid presented with worsening dyspnoea and abdominal bloating. Echocardiography demonstrated severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary stenosis with thickened valve leaflets, characteristic of carcinoid heart disease. She was managed with aggressive diuresis and scheduled for a tricuspid valve replacement alongside escalated somatostatin analogue therapy.

carcinoid_syndrome_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute carcinoid crisis
  presenting_complaint: Profound hypotension and intense flushing during surgery
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old patient underwent a laparotomy for debulking of a known mesenteric neuroendocrine tumour. Intraoperatively, they developed life-threatening hypotension and a deep violet flush unresponsive to standard vasopressors. An emergency intravenous octreotide bolus and infusion were administered, stabilising the haemodynamic status and confirming an intraoperative carcinoid crisis.

carcinoid_syndrome_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Bronchial carcinoid with systemic symptoms
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent wheezing and facial redness
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old non-smoker was initially treated for adult-onset asthma with poor response to inhalers. Further history revealed the wheezing was accompanied by facial flushing; a chest CT identified a 2cm endobronchial mass. Biopsy confirmed a typical bronchial carcinoid, and the systemic symptoms resolved completely following a lobectomy, despite the absence of liver metastases.

carcinoid_syndrome_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Carcinoid-induced pellagra
  presenting_complaint: Chronic diarrhoea, dermatitis, and confusion
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with long-standing untreated carcinoid syndrome presented with a symmetric, pigmented skin rash on sun-exposed areas and cognitive decline. Laboratory tests confirmed niacin deficiency, caused by the tumour shunting tryptophan into serotonin production. He was treated with nicotinamide supplementation and somatostatin analogues, improving both the dermatitis and neurological status.

carcinoid_syndrome_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory carcinoid syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Persistent diarrhoea despite maximal somatostatin analogue therapy
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female with metastatic midgut NET continued to experience 10 bowel movements daily despite high-dose Lanreotide and rescue Octreotide. Telotristat ethyl was added to her regimen to inhibit serotonin synthesis. Within four weeks, her stool frequency reduced to 3 per day, and her urinary 5-HIAA levels significantly decreased.

carcinoid_syndrome_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Ovarian carcinoid syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Rapid onset flushing and palpitations
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female presented with classic carcinoid symptoms but had no evidence of liver disease on imaging. A pelvic MRI identified a large complex adnexal mass, which was surgically resected. Histopathology confirmed a primary ovarian carcinoid, which had caused systemic symptoms by releasing serotonin directly into the systemic circulation, bypassing the portal system.

carcinoid_syndrome_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Gastric carcinoid syndrome (Type 1)
  presenting_complaint: Patchy, bright red flushing and epigastric pain
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with known pernicious anaemia and chronic atrophic gastritis presented with atypical, histamine-mediated "patchy" flushing. Gastroscopy revealed multiple small polyps in the gastric fundus, confirmed as Type 1 gastric neuroendocrine tumours. Management focused on endoscopic surveillance and Vitamin B12 replacement, as the risk of metastasis and severe syndrome is low in this subtype.

carcinoid_syndrome_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Metastatic appendiceal carcinoid
  presenting_complaint: Right lower quadrant pain and recent onset diarrhoea
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male underwent an emergency appendicectomy for presumed appendicitis, but histology showed a 2.5cm neuroendocrine tumour at the base with lymphovascular invasion. Post-operative staging CT revealed multiple liver lesions and elevated Chromogranin A. He was started on Octreotide LAR to manage emerging secretory diarrhoea and referred for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT).

carcinoid_syndrome_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Anaesthesia-induced carcinoid crisis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden intraoperative bronchospasm and tachycardia
  summary_of_course: During induction of anaesthesia for an elective cholecystectomy, a 62-year-old patient with undiagnosed liver lesions developed severe bronchospasm and tachycardia. The procedure was abandoned, and the patient was transferred to ICU. Subsequent investigations, including a Ga-68 DOTATATE PET/CT, confirmed a metastatic midgut NET that had been triggered by anaesthetic agents.

carcinoid_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Carcinoid syndrome mimicking IBS
  presenting_complaint: Years of intermittent abdominal cramping and urgency
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female had been managed for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) for five years with minimal relief from loperamide. The development of telangiectasia on her cheeks prompted a re-evaluation; a serum Chromogranin A was found to be 20 times the upper limit of normal. A small-bowel MRI identified a terminal ileal mass and mesenteric lymphadenopathy, confirming carcinoid syndrome.

carcinoid_syndrome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe carcinoid syndrome with malnutrition
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss, steatorrhoea, and severe flushing
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male with extensive hepatic metastatic burden from a midgut NET presented with a BMI of 17 and signs of fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. The severe secretory diarrhoea was causing significant malabsorption and electrolyte imbalances. He required inpatient stabilisation with parenteral nutrition and continuous intravenous octreotide before transitioning to long-acting analogues and hepatic artery embolisation.

carcinoid_syndrome_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-embolisation carcinoid flare
  presenting_complaint: Acute exacerbation of flushing and abdominal pain post-procedure
  summary_of_course: A patient with symptomatic liver metastases underwent transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) to reduce tumour burden. Six hours post-procedure, they experienced a massive release of serotonin, resulting in intense flushing and hypertension. This "flare" was managed with high-dose intravenous octreotide and fluids, highlighting the need for prophylactic somatostatin analogues during liver-directed therapies.

carcinoid_syndrome_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Carcinoid syndrome in a peri-menopausal female
  presenting_complaint: Hot flushes and night sweats
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female was initially prescribed hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for presumed menopausal symptoms. When the "hot flushes" failed to respond and were accompanied by new-onset diarrhoea, a 24-hour urinary 5-HIAA was ordered. The results were markedly elevated, and a subsequent CT scan revealed a primary midgut tumour with liver involvement.

carcinoid_syndrome_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Carcinoid syndrome with mesenteric fibrosis
  presenting_complaint: Small bowel obstruction and chronic diarrhoea
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male presented with acute-on-chronic abdominal pain and vomiting. Imaging showed a "sunburst" appearance of the mesentery, characteristic of desmoplastic reaction from a local NET, causing tethering of bowel loops. He required surgical bypass of the obstructed segment and long-term somatostatin analogues to control the underlying carcinoid syndrome.

carcinoid_syndrome_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Metastatic rectal carcinoid
  presenting_complaint: Tenesmus and facial flushing
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male presented with rectal bleeding and tenesmus; colonoscopy identified a 3cm rectal mass. Biopsies confirmed a high-grade neuroendocrine tumour (G3), and staging showed liver metastases. Unlike most rectal NETs, this patient developed classic carcinoid syndrome, necessitating combined treatment with chemotherapy and somatostatin analogues.

carcinoid_syndrome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Carcinoid syndrome with multiple comorbidities
  presenting_complaint: Diarrhoea in a patient with heart failure and CKD
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male with pre-existing congestive heart failure and Stage 4 CKD presented with worsening diarrhoea. Distinguishing between carcinoid-induced secretory diarrhoea and diuretic-related issues was challenging. Low-dose Lanreotide was initiated with cautious fluid monitoring, providing symptomatic relief without exacerbating his renal impairment.

carcinoid_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: High-volume secretory carcinoid diarrhoea
  presenting_complaint: 15-20 watery stools per day and hypokalaemia
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old female was admitted with severe dehydration and a potassium of 2.8 mmol/L due to high-volume diarrhoea. Stool studies were negative for infection, but her serum serotonin was extremely high. She required aggressive electrolyte replacement and was started on the maximum licensed dose of Octreotide LAR, eventually requiring the addition of Telotristat.

carcinoid_syndrome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Incidental metastatic NET with mild syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic liver lesions on routine ultrasound
  summary_of_course: During a routine ultrasound for gallstones, a 72-year-old female was found to have multiple liver shadows. On direct questioning, she admitted to occasional "feeling hot" and two loose stools a day, which she had attributed to ageing. Biopsy and 5-HIAA confirmed a low-grade metastatic midgut NET with mild carcinoid syndrome, managed conservatively with watchful waiting and PRRT.

carcinoid_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Rapidly progressive carcinoid syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly increasing abdominal girth and severe flushing
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old male experienced a rapid onset of symptoms over three months, with hepatomegaly and ascites. Imaging showed near-total replacement of the liver with metastatic neuroendocrine tumour. Despite starting somatostatin analogues, his symptoms progressed rapidly, and he was transitioned to palliative care due to the aggressive nature of the G3 neuroendocrine carcinoma.
