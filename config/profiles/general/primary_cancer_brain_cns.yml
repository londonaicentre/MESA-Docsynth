  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of expressive aphasia and right-sided facial droop.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male presented acutely to the ED with rapid cognitive decline and focal neurological deficits. MRI Brain revealed a 4cm ring-enhancing lesion in the left temporal lobe with significant perilesional oedema and midline shift. He underwent emergency debulking surgery followed by the Stupp protocol (radiotherapy and temozolomide), but prognosis remains guarded due to MGMT promoter non-methylation.

primary_cancer_brain_cns_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Medulloblastoma
  presenting_complaint: Morning vomiting, persistent headaches, and worsening ataxia.
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old girl was referred by her GP after a three-week history of cerebellar signs and nocturnal headaches.

  primary_diagnosis: Benign Meningioma
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding on CT scan following a minor head injury.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old female underwent a CT head after a mechanical fall, which revealed a 1.5cm well-circumscribed, calcified extra-axial mass at the vertex. The patient was asymptomatic with no neurological deficits on examination. Given her age and the stable appearance of the lesion, a "watch and wait" approach with annual surveillance MRI was adopted.

  primary_diagnosis: Spinal Cord Ependymoma
  presenting_complaint: Chronic progressive lower limb weakness and loss of bowel control.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female presented with a six-month history of ascending sensory loss and gait instability.

  primary_diagnosis: Pilocytic Astrocytoma
  presenting_complaint: Clumsiness and frequent falls over the last two months.
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old boy presented with worsening coordination and a wide-based gait. Imaging revealed a large cystic lesion with an enhancing mural nodule in the cerebellum.

primary_cancer_brain_cns_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Diffuse Midline Glioma (DIPG)
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressing double vision and facial weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old girl presented with multiple cranial nerve palsies and long-tract signs over a 10-day period. MRI revealed an infiltrative, expansile lesion of the pons (DIPG) with H3 K27M mutation. Due to the high-risk location, surgery was not feasible, and she was transitioned to palliative radiotherapy to manage symptoms.

primary_cancer_brain_cns_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Pituitary Macroadenoma
  presenting_complaint: Gradual loss of peripheral vision and chronic fatigue.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male was found to have bitemporal hemianopia on visual field testing. MRI Sellar region showed a 3.5cm mass compressing the optic chiasm and invading the cavernous sinus. He underwent transsphenoidal resection and required lifelong hormone replacement therapy for panhypopituitarism post-operatively.

primary_cancer_brain_cns_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Craniopharyngioma
  presenting_complaint: Growth retardation and excessive thirst.
  summary_of_course: A 9-year-old boy was investigated for short stature and symptoms of diabetes insipidus. A CT scan showed a suprasellar mass with characteristic "machine oil" cystic components and calcification. Following partial resection and cyst drainage, he was treated with proton beam therapy to minimize damage to the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.

primary_cancer_brain_cns_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Pineoblastoma
  presenting_complaint: Severe headache, nausea, and inability to look upwards.
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old male presented with signs of Parinaud syndrome and acute obstructive hydrocephalus. Urgent MRI identified a highly aggressive mass in the pineal region with CSF seeding. He required an emergency external ventricular drain (EVD) followed by aggressive craniospinal irradiation and multi-agent chemotherapy.

primary_cancer_brain_cns_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Cerebellar Hemangioblastoma
  presenting_complaint: Persistent dizziness and occipital headaches.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female with known Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome presented with worsening vertigo. Imaging showed a highly vascular cystic lesion in the right cerebellar hemisphere. She underwent successful surgical excision; however, she remains under close surveillance for further CNS and visceral manifestations of her genetic condition.

  primary_diagnosis: Chordoma of the Clivus
  presenting_complaint: Persistent double vision and deep-seated retro-orbital pain.
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old male presented with a six-month history of progressive abducens nerve palsy. MRI and CT showed a destructive bone lesion at the skull base (clivus) with soft tissue extension. He underwent an endoscopic endonasal resection followed by high-dose proton beam therapy due to the high risk of local recurrence.

primary_cancer_brain_cns_014:
  primary_diagnosis: CNS Germinoma
  presenting_complaint: Polyuria, polydipsia, and delayed puberty.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old male presented with symptoms of diabetes insipidus and growth hormone deficiency. Imaging revealed a mass in the suprasellar region and a second lesion in the pineal gland. Biopsy confirmed a germinoma; the patient showed a dramatic response to low-dose radiotherapy and chemotherapy, achieving complete remission.

  primary_diagnosis: Anaplastic Astrocytoma (Grade 3)
  presenting_complaint: Worsening speech difficulties and right-sided weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with a previous history of low-grade glioma presented with clinical progression. Repeat MRI showed new enhancement and increased perfusion within the previous tumour bed, suggesting malignant transformation. She underwent a second debulking surgery and was started on second-line chemotherapy with lomustine.

primary_cancer_brain_cns_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Intramedullary Spinal Cord Glioma
  presenting_complaint: Burning pain in the arms and progressive hand weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old male presented with cervical myelopathy symptoms over several months. MRI C-spine showed a diffuse intramedullary expansion from C3 to C6. Due to the infiltrative nature of the Grade 2 astrocytoma, only a biopsy and decompressive laminectomy were performed, followed by local radiotherapy to stabilise the disease.

primary_cancer_brain_cns_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Choroid Plexus Carcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly increasing head circumference and irritability in an infant.
  summary_of_course: An 11-month-old infant presented with macrocephaly and a bulging fontanelle. Ultrasound and subsequent MRI revealed a massive, vascular intraventricular tumour in the lateral ventricle with associated hydrocephalus. Despite aggressive surgery and chemotherapy, the patient suffered from leptomeningeal spread and poor clinical outcome.

  primary_diagnosis: Ganglioglioma
  presenting_complaint: Refractory focal seizures since childhood.
  summary_of_course: A 23-year-old female with a long history of temporal lobe epilepsy, poorly controlled on three anti-epileptic drugs, underwent high-resolution MRI. A small, cortically-based cystic lesion was identified in the left mesial temporal lobe. Post-surgical resection, histology confirmed a Grade 1 ganglioglioma, and the patient has remained seizure-free for two years.

primary_cancer_brain_cns_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Vestibular Schwannoma (Acoustic Neuroma)
  presenting_complaint: Unilateral hearing loss and persistent tinnitus.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female presented with progressive deafness in her left ear over 18 months. Audiometry confirmed sensorineural hearing loss, and MRI showed a 2cm mass in the left cerebellopontine angle with "ice cream cone" appearance. She elected for stereotactic radiosurgery (Gamma Knife) to prevent further growth while preserving facial nerve function.

  primary_diagnosis: Gliomatosis Cerebri
  presenting_complaint: Global cognitive decline and gait instability.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male was initially investigated for suspected dementia. MRI demonstrated diffuse, non-enhancing T2/FLAIR hyperintensity involving more than three lobes of the brain, including the thalamus and brainstem. Biopsy confirmed a diffuse astrocytic infiltration; the patient was managed with palliative intent using temozolomide to slow disease progression.
