  primary_diagnosis: Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis (Anti-Hu)
  presenting_complaint: Subacute personality changes, irritability, and seizures.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female smoker presented with progressive amnesia and emotional lability. Investigation for an underlying malignancy via PET-CT revealed a small cell lung cancer. Despite chemotherapy and steroids, her neurological status remained poor due to irreversible neuronal loss in the hippocampus.

encephalitis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) encephalitis
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive dementia and cranial nerve deficits in an HIV-positive patient.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male with a CD4 count of 12 cells/uL presented with ventriculoencephalitis. MRI demonstrated periventricular enhancement, and CSF PCR was positive for CMV. He was treated with IV ganciclovir and foscarnet but unfortunately succumbed to systemic opportunistic infections.

encephalitis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Rasmussen's encephalitis
  presenting_complaint: Refractory focal motor seizures and progressive hemiparesis.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old girl developed epilepsia partialis continua affecting her left hand. Serial MRI showed progressive atrophy of the right cerebral hemisphere. After failing multiple anti-seizure medications and IVIG, she eventually underwent a functional hemispherectomy to control the seizures.

encephalitis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild enteroviral encephalitis
  presenting_complaint: Headache, low-grade fever, and mild irritability.
