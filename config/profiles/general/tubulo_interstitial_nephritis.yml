tubulo_interstitial_nephritis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute drug-induced tubulo-interstitial nephritis
  presenting_complaint: Maculopapular rash, fever, and reduced urine output
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented with a diffuse rash and pyrexia five days after starting Ibuprofen for chronic back pain. Investigations revealed a serum creatinine of 280 µmol/L and peripheral eosinophilia, with urinalysis showing sterile pyuria and white cell casts. Renal biopsy confirmed dense interstitial inflammatory infiltrates with eosinophils, and the patient showed significant recovery following drug cessation and a tapering course of oral Prednisolone.

tubulo_interstitial_nephritis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute PPI-induced tubulo-interstitial nephritis
  presenting_complaint: Non-specific malaise, nausea, and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female with a history of GORD treated with Omeprazole for six months presented with progressive fatigue and a rise in creatinine from 90 to 310 µmol/L. Unlike classic presentations, she lacked a rash or fever, but biopsy demonstrated chronic interstitial changes alongside acute tubular injury. Omeprazole was discontinued, and while renal function improved, she was left with Stage 3b chronic kidney disease.

tubulo_interstitial_nephritis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Tubulo-interstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral eye redness, photophobia, and bilateral flank pain
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old girl presented to ophthalmology with anterior uveitis, subsequently found to have a creatinine of 160 µmol/L and glycosuria with normal blood glucose. Renal biopsy showed acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis with no glomerular involvement. She was treated with topical steroids for her eyes and systemic steroids for her kidneys, resulting in a full resolution of renal impairment.

tubulo_interstitial_nephritis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic interstitial nephritis secondary to Lithium
  presenting_complaint: Polyuria, polydipsia, and gradual decline in renal function
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with bipolar affective disorder on long-term Lithium therapy (20 years) was referred from the community with a stable but elevated creatinine of 195 µmol/L. Investigations confirmed nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and biopsy showed extensive interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy with characteristic microcysts. Management involved a multidisciplinary review to transition to alternative mood stabilisers and strict blood pressure control to slow CKD progression.

tubulo_interstitial_nephritis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Sarcoidosis-associated granulomatous interstitial nephritis
  presenting_complaint: Dry cough, hypercalcaemia, and incidental renal impairment
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old male of Afro-Caribbean descent presented with respiratory symptoms and was found to have a creatinine of 240 µmol/L and a serum calcium of 3.1 mmol/L. Chest X-ray showed bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and a renal biopsy revealed non-caseating granulomas within the interstitium. He responded well to high-dose corticosteroids, with creatinine returning to 110 µmol/L within three weeks.

tubulo_interstitial_nephritis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced acute interstitial nephritis
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic rise in serum creatinine during chemotherapy
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old female receiving Pembrolizumab for metastatic melanoma developed a Grade 3 AKI with creatinine peaking at 420 µmol/L. Clinical suspicion of immune-related adverse events led to a renal biopsy confirming acute interstitial nephritis. Immunotherapy was held, and she was started on IV Methylprednisolone followed by oral Prednisolone, leading to partial recovery of renal function.

tubulo_interstitial_nephritis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic tubulo-interstitial nephritis
  presenting_complaint: Confusion and worsening renal function following antibiotic therapy
  summary_of_course: An 83-year-old male with pre-existing CKD Stage 3a was treated with Amoxicillin for a chest infection; two weeks later, his creatinine rose from 140 to 480 µmol/L. He presented with delirium and mild peripheral oedema, but no classic allergic features. Biopsy showed acute tubulo-interstitial inflammation superimposed on significant background glomerulosclerosis and fibrosis, requiring a prolonged steroid taper to achieve a new baseline creatinine of 210 µmol/L.

tubulo_interstitial_nephritis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Sjögren’s syndrome-associated chronic interstitial nephritis
  presenting_complaint: Severe dryness of eyes and mouth with persistent hypokalaemia
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female was referred to nephrology for persistent hypokalaemia (2.8 mmol/L) and hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis. Investigations confirmed Distal Renal Tubular Acidosis (Type 1) and positive anti-Ro/SSA antibodies. Renal biopsy showed a lymphocytic interstitial infiltrate consistent with Sjögren's, and she was managed with bicarbonate supplements and Hydroxychloroquine.

tubulo_interstitial_nephritis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of loin pain and macroscopic haematuria
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old previously healthy male presented with acute loin pain mimicking nephrolithiasis, but imaging was negative for stones. Creatinine was 215 µmol/L, and biopsy showed intense interstitial inflammation without a clear drug or infectious trigger. Extensive autoimmune and infectious screening was negative, leading to a diagnosis of idiopathic TIN, which responded rapidly to a short course of steroids.

tubulo_interstitial_nephritis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Legionella-associated acute interstitial nephritis
  presenting_complaint: High fever, pleuritic chest pain, and severe oliguric AKI
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male was admitted to the ICU with Legionella pneumonia and multi-organ failure. Despite haemodynamic stabilisation, his AKI persisted with a creatinine of 550 µmol/L, and biopsy demonstrated acute interstitial nephritis rather than pure acute tubular necrosis. He required temporary continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVH) and specific antibiotic therapy, eventually recovering independent renal function.

tubulo_interstitial_nephritis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic tubulo-interstitial nephritis due to lead toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Hypertension, gout, and progressive renal decline
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old bridge renovator presented with poorly controlled hypertension and recurrent gouty arthritis. Laboratory tests showed a creatinine of 180 µmol/L and a normocytic anaemia, with subsequent blood lead levels found to be significantly elevated. Renal biopsy confirmed chronic interstitial nephritis with intranuclear inclusion bodies in tubular cells, necessitating occupational cessation and chelation therapy.

tubulo_interstitial_nephritis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Balkan endemic nephropathy
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic proteinuria and anaemia in a migrant patient
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male originally from a rural village in Bulgaria was found to have CKD Stage 4 (eGFR 22 mL/min) during a routine health check in the UK. Ultrasound showed small, smooth, symmetrical kidneys, and urinalysis revealed low-grade tubular proteinuria (0.8 g/day). Given his geographic origin and the biopsy findings of acellular interstitial fibrosis, a diagnosis of Balkan endemic nephropathy was made, and he was monitored for associated urothelial malignancies.

tubulo_interstitial_nephritis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Aristolochic acid nephropathy (Chinese herbal nephropathy)
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive renal failure and severe anaemia
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female presented with a creatinine of 400 µmol/L after consuming traditional Chinese herbal supplements for weight loss over twelve months. Biopsy revealed extensive, paucicellular interstitial fibrosis starting from the outer cortex. Due to the high risk of malignancy associated with aristolochic acid, she underwent regular cystoscopic surveillance alongside management of her progressing end-stage renal disease.

tubulo_interstitial_nephritis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe acute TIN with dialysis dependence
  presenting_complaint: Anuria, vomiting, and profound uraemia
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male developed life-threatening AKI (creatinine 950 µmol/L, potassium 6.8 mmol/L) three weeks after starting Rifampicin for prosthetic joint infection. He was urgently dialysed and a biopsy showed 90% interstitial involvement with numerous eosinophils and focal tubular rupture. Despite intensive steroid treatment, he failed to recover sufficient function and remained on long-term haemodialysis.

tubulo_interstitial_nephritis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild antibiotic-induced tubulo-interstitial nephritis
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of raised creatinine during cellulitis treatment
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male was treated with IV Flucloxacillin for severe cellulitis; his creatinine rose from 85 to 135 µmol/L over four days. He remained asymptomatic with no rash, but urine microscopy showed occasional white cell casts. The antibiotic was switched to Vancomycin, and the creatinine returned to baseline within 48 hours without the need for steroids.

tubulo_interstitial_nephritis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: IgG4-related tubulo-interstitial nephritis
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral submandibular swelling and renal impairment
  summary_of_course: A 56-year-old male presented with Mikulicz syndrome (salivary gland swelling) and a creatinine of 205 µmol/L. Imaging showed enlarged kidneys with multiple low-attenuation lesions, and biopsy revealed a "storiform" pattern of interstitial fibrosis with >10 IgG4-positive plasma cells per high-power field. He responded dramatically to Prednisolone and Rituximab, with normalisation of renal function and resolution of lymphadenopathy.

tubulo_interstitial_nephritis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: CMV-induced tubulo-interstitial nephritis
  presenting_complaint: Fever and graft dysfunction in a renal transplant recipient
  summary_of_course: A 49-year-old male, six months post-renal transplant, presented with a rise in creatinine from 120 to 230 µmol/L and low-grade pyrexia. CMV PCR was positive (50,000 copies/mL), and allograft biopsy showed viral cytopathic changes (owl’s eye inclusions) within the tubular epithelial cells and associated interstitial inflammation. Treatment with IV Ganciclovir led to viral suppression and stabilization of graft function.

tubulo_interstitial_nephritis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Systemic lupus erythematosus-associated interstitial nephritis
  presenting_complaint: Joint pains, malar rash, and new-onset renal impairment
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female with known SLE presented with a flare; surprisingly, her urinalysis showed no significant haematuria or proteinuria, but her creatinine was 175 µmol/L. Renal biopsy showed predominant tubulo-interstitial inflammation with minimal glomerular changes (ISN/RPS Class I). Management required intensification of her immunosuppression with Mycophenolate Mofetil, which successfully improved her renal parameters.

tubulo_interstitial_nephritis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute TIN with Fanconi syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Bone pain, polyuria, and weakness
  summary_of_course: A 13-year-old boy presented with symptoms of rickets and was found to have hypophosphataemia, glycosuria, and aminoaciduria. Creatinine was mildly elevated at 115 µmol/L, and a biopsy confirmed subacute tubulo-interstitial nephritis with marked proximal tubular damage. An underlying metabolic cause was excluded, and the TIN was suspected to be idiopathic, responding partially to steroid therapy and phosphate supplementation.

tubulo_interstitial_nephritis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent tubulo-interstitial nephritis following steroid withdrawal
  presenting_complaint: Relapse of AKI symptoms during steroid tapering
  summary_of_course: A 51-year-old female with previous biopsy-proven drug-induced TIN (secondary to Naproxen) was successfully treated with Prednisolone 40mg. However, as the dose was tapered below 10mg, her creatinine rose from 105 to 190 µmol/L. A repeat biopsy showed active interstitial inflammation, necessitating the introduction of Azathioprine as a steroid-sparing agent to maintain remission.
