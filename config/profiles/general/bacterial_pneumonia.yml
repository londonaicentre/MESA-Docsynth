  primary_diagnosis: Pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath and persistent pyrexia.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male was admitted with pneumonia but failed to improve after 72 hours of antibiotics. Ultrasound confirmed a moderate pleural effusion, and thoracocentesis showed sterile fluid with a pH of 7.3. The effusion resolved with continued intravenous antibiotics and did not require chest drain insertion.

bacterial_pneumonia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Pleural empyema
  presenting_complaint: Pleuritic pain, night sweats, and weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male smoker presented with subacute symptoms over three weeks. Pleural fluid aspiration revealed frank pus with a pH of 6.8 and growth of Streptococcus anginosus. He required a large-bore chest drain, intrapleural fibrinolysis, and a 4-week course of targeted antibiotics.

bacterial_pneumonia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Ventilator-associated pneumonia
  presenting_complaint: Deteriorating gas exchange and increased secretions.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female in the ICU for polytrauma developed new infiltrates on CXR after 8 days of mechanical ventilation. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) grew Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae. Treatment was escalated to meropenem based on sensitivities, requiring a prolonged weaning process from the ventilator.

bacterial_pneumonia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Pneumonia in an immunocompromised host
  presenting_complaint: Fever and cough following chemotherapy.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with acute myeloid leukaemia presented with febrile neutropenia (neutrophils 0.2 x 10^9/L). CXR showed subtle focal opacification, and he was started on empirical piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin. Sputum cultures eventually confirmed Escherichia coli, and he remained on broad-spectrum cover until his counts recovered.
