cystic_fibrosis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Cystic fibrosis (newborn screening)
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic; positive newborn blood spot screening for immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT).
  summary_of_course: A 2-week-old neonate with F508del homozygous genotype confirmed via sweat testing (95 mmol/L). Physical examination is unremarkable with normal weight gain. Commenced on prophylactic flucloxacillin, salt supplementation, and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) following faecal elastase results of <15 mcg/g.

cystic_fibrosis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Meconium ileus
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal distension and failure to pass meconium within 48 hours of birth.
  summary_of_course: A term neonate presented with bilious vomiting and palpable bowel loops. Contrast enema showed a microcolon and inspissated meconium in the terminal ileum, requiring a laparotomy and Bishop-Koop ileostomy. Subsequent genetic testing confirmed cystic fibrosis (F508del/G551D), and the patient was stabilised on a specialist neonatal CF pathway.

cystic_fibrosis_003:

Genetic sequencing identified a compound heterozygosity for F508del and the 5T polymorphism, confirming a mild CF phenotype with no pulmonary or gastrointestinal symptoms.

cystic_fibrosis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute pulmonary exacerbation of CF
  presenting_complaint: Increased productive cough, green sputum, and reduced exercise tolerance.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old female with known CF presented with a 10% drop in FEV1 and increased crackles on auscultation. Sputum culture grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa; she was admitted for a 14-day course of intravenous ceftazidime and tobramycin. Lung function returned to baseline following intensive chest physiotherapy and IV antibiotics.

cystic_fibrosis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Distal Intestinal Obstruction Syndrome (DIOS)
  presenting_complaint: Colicky right lower quadrant abdominal pain and reduced stool frequency.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male with CF presented to A&E with nausea and a palpable mass in the right iliac fossa. Abdominal X-ray showed faecal loading in the caecum.

  primary_diagnosis: Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA)
  presenting_complaint: Worsening wheeze and "brown plugs" in sputum.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy with CF failed to respond to standard antibiotics for a suspected exacerbation. Investigations showed a high total IgE (1200 IU/mL), positive Aspergillus-specific IgE, and fleeting infiltrates on chest X-ray. He was treated with a tapering course of oral prednisolone and itraconazole, leading to clinical and radiological resolution.

cystic_fibrosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Massive haemoptysis in CF
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of coughing up approximately 300ml of bright red blood.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female with severe CF (FEV1 35%) was admitted to the ICU following life-threatening haemoptysis. She underwent emergency bronchial artery embolisation (BAE) to stabilise the bleeding. Post-procedure, she was treated with IV antibiotics and tranexamic acid, with no further bleeding episodes during that admission.

cystic_fibrosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: CF-related liver disease (CFLD) with portal hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Routine review found new-onset splenomegaly.
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old girl with CF showed deranged LFTs and thrombocytopenia on annual review. Ultrasound revealed a nodular liver and reversed flow in the portal vein, consistent with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. She was started on ursodeoxycholic acid and entered into an endoscopic surveillance programme for oesophageal varices.

cystic_fibrosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Burkholderia cepacia complex colonisation
  presenting_complaint: Chronic decline in lung function over 12 months.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male previously stable on Ivacaftor/Tezacaftor/Elexacaftor showed a persistent drop in FEV1 from 60% to 45%. Sputum cultures repeatedly grew Burkholderia cenocepacia. Despite aggressive triple-therapy IV antibiotics (meropenem, ceftazidime, and minocycline), his lung function remained suboptimal, necessitating a referral for lung transplant assessment.

cystic_fibrosis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Pneumothorax in advanced CF
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset pleuritic chest pain and acute shortness of breath.
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old male with end-stage CF lung disease presented with type 2 respiratory failure. Chest X-ray confirmed a 30% right-sided pneumothorax. Due to persistent air leak despite chest drain insertion, he underwent surgical pleurodesis to prevent recurrence, though his recovery was prolonged by a pulmonary infection.

cystic_fibrosis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: CF-related bone disease (CFRBD)
  presenting_complaint: Acute back pain after lifting a heavy bag.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with CF and a history of chronic steroid use for ABPA underwent spinal X-rays showing a T12 wedge fracture. DXA scan revealed a T-score of -3.2 at the lumbar spine. She was diagnosed with severe osteoporosis and commenced on IV zoledronic acid and high-dose Vitamin D3.

cystic_fibrosis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Nasal polyposis and chronic rhinosinusitis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic nasal congestion, anosmia, and headaches.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with CF reported poor sleep and persistent sinus pressure. Nasal endoscopy revealed Grade 3 bilateral polyps obstructing the middle meatus. He underwent Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) after failing to respond to topical steroid rinses and long-term macrolides, resulting in significant symptomatic relief.

cystic_fibrosis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: CF-related arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Swollen, painful knees and ankles following a pulmonary exacerbation.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female developed an acute episodic polyarthritis involving the large joints. Inflammatory markers were elevated (CRP 85), but rheumatoid factor and ANA were negative. The symptoms resolved within three weeks using naproxen, and the presentation was consistent with cystic fibrosis-related arthritis (CFRA).

cystic_fibrosis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Lung Allograft Dysfunction (CLAD)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive dyspnoea 3 years post-bilateral lung transplant.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male with CF had a successful double lung transplant in 2020. Recent spirometry showed a persistent 20% decline in FEV1 not attributable to infection or acute rejection. High-resolution CT showed new-onset bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) pattern; he was started on montelukast and azithromycin to slow progression.

cystic_fibrosis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: CF with Vitamin K deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Easy bruising and prolonged bleeding from minor cuts.
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old boy with known pancreatic insufficiency was found to have an elevated Prothrombin Time (PT) during pre-operative screening for dental work. Despite taking PERT, his fat-soluble vitamin absorption was poor. He was diagnosed with symptomatic Vitamin K deficiency and required oral phytomenadione supplementation to normalise his coagulation profile.

cystic_fibrosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Port-a-cath related sepsis
  presenting_complaint: High fever, rigors, and tenderness over the venous access device site.
  summary_of_course: A 20-year-old female undergoing home IV antibiotics for a CF flare developed systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Blood cultures from the port-a-cath grew Staphylococcus aureus. The device was surgically removed, and she completed a 14-day course of IV flucloxacillin via a temporary PICC line.

cystic_fibrosis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Late-diagnosis CF (R117H mutation)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent bouts of bronchitis and bronchiectasis in a 55-year-old.
  summary_of_course: An older adult male with a history of "adult-onset asthma" was investigated for persistent bronchiectasis on CT. Sweat chloride was borderline (45 mmol/L), but genetic testing identified F508del and R117H (7T) mutations. He was started on Ivacaftor with a significant improvement in cough and a 15% increase in FEV1.

cystic_fibrosis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: End-stage CF lung disease
  presenting_complaint: Severe breathlessness at rest and requirement for 24-hour oxygen.
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old male with FEV1 of 18% predicted and chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure (pCO2 8.5 kPa). He was no longer a candidate for lung transplantation due to multi-resistant infections and frailty. The clinical focus shifted to palliative care, using low-dose morphine for dyspnoea and midazolam for anxiety, ensuring a comfortable end-of-life transition at home.
