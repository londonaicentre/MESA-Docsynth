  presenting_complaint: Persistent yellow, watery stools and urgency.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old male with a diagnosis of IBS-D failed to respond to standard antidiarrhoeals. A SeHCAT scan revealed moderate bile acid malabsorption (10% retention at 7 days). He was started on colesevelam, which significantly reduced his stool frequency and urgency, though he retained a baseline of IBS-related bloating.

irritable_bowel_syndrome_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe IBS-D with faecal incontinence
  presenting_complaint: Uncontrollable urgency and occasional accidents.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female presented with severe IBS-D that led to social isolation due to fear of incontinence. Anorectal manometry showed normal sphincter tone, and colonoscopy was clear. She was managed with high-dose loperamide and referral for pelvic floor physiotherapy to improve rectal sensation and control.

  primary_diagnosis: IBS-D triggered by caffeine and alcohol
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent diarrhoea and cramping.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old university student noted that his bowel symptoms were exclusively tied to weekends and high caffeine intake during exams. A symptom diary confirmed the correlation between dietary triggers and IBS-D flares. Education on trigger avoidance led to complete symptom resolution without pharmacological intervention.

irritable_bowel_syndrome_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Irritable bowel syndrome in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Exacerbation of constipation and bloating during the second trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old pregnant female with pre-existing IBS-C experienced a severe worsening of symptoms.

  primary_diagnosis: IBS-D with suspected small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)
  presenting_complaint: Profuse bloating and gas immediately after eating.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female with IBS-D symptoms underwent a hydrogen breath test which was positive for SIBO. She completed a course of rifaximin, which provided temporary relief, but her symptoms recurred. She was subsequently managed for underlying IBS-D with a low FODMAP diet and prokinetics.

irritable_bowel_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: IBS-C with secondary haemorrhoids
  presenting_complaint: Rectal bleeding and painful defecation.
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old male with long-standing IBS-C presented with bright red rectal bleeding. Proctoscopy confirmed grade II haemorrhoids secondary to chronic straining. Management focused on softening the stool with prucalopride and topical haemorrhoidal treatment, which resolved the bleeding and improved his IBS symptoms.
