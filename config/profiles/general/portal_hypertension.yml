portal_hypertension_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Decompensated Alcohol-related Liver Disease
  presenting_complaint: Massive haematemesis and melaena
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with known heavy alcohol intake presented with life-threatening upper GI bleeding. Emergency endoscopy revealed Grade III oesophageal varices which were treated with band ligation. He was stabilised with terlipressin, intravenous antibiotics, and blood products, later transitioning to carvedilol for secondary prophylaxis of portal hypertension.

portal_hypertension_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD)
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of low platelets on routine screening
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female with Type 2 diabetes and obesity was found to have a platelet count of 95 x 10^9/L. FibroScan showed a liver stiffness of 22 kPa, and ultrasound confirmed splenomegaly and a dilated portal vein (14mm). She was diagnosed with compensated cirrhosis and mild portal hypertension, and commenced on screening for varices.

portal_hypertension_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Budd-Chiari Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset RUQ pain, abdominal distension, and jaundice
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female on the combined oral contraceptive pill presented with acute abdominal swelling and tender hepatomegaly. Doppler ultrasound and CT venogram confirmed hepatic vein thrombosis with caudate lobe hypertrophy.

  primary_diagnosis: Extrahepatic Portal Vein Thrombosis (EHPVT)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent haematemesis in a paediatric patient
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old boy with a history of neonatal umbilical vein catheterisation presented with repeated episodes of upper GI bleeding. Imaging revealed a "cavernoma" of the portal vein and massive splenomegaly but normal liver parenchyma on biopsy. He was managed with serial variceal banding and is being considered for a Meso-Rex bypass procedure.

portal_hypertension_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Hepatorenal Syndrome Type 1 (HRS-AKI)
  presenting_complaint: Oliguria and rising creatinine in the setting of known cirrhosis
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old male with HCV-related cirrhosis was admitted with worsening ascites and a rapid decline in renal function (creatinine 240 µmol/L). Following a trial of fluid resuscitation and albumin without improvement, he was diagnosed with HRS secondary to portal hypertension-induced splanchnic vasodilation. He responded well to a combination of intravenous albumin and terlipressin.

portal_hypertension_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Schistosomiasis (Hepatosplenic)
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal discomfort and prominent abdominal wall veins
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male who recently emigrated from Egypt presented with significant splenomegaly and "caput medusae". Investigations showed Symmers' pipe-stem fibrosis on ultrasound and positive Schistosoma serology. Despite preserved synthetic liver function, he has severe non-cirrhotic portal hypertension and was listed for prophylactic variceal banding.

portal_hypertension_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Ascites
  presenting_complaint: Persistent abdominal swelling despite high-dose diuretics
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with NASH-related cirrhosis required large-volume paracentesis every 10 days despite maximal doses of spironolactone and furosemide. A Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) was successfully placed, reducing the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) from 22 mmHg to 8 mmHg. Her ascites resolved, though she required close monitoring for hepatic encephalopathy.

portal_hypertension_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Hepatic Encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, reversal of sleep-wake cycle, and asterixis
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with cryptogenic cirrhosis presented with Grade 2 hepatic encephalopathy triggered by constipation. Ammonia levels were elevated, and EEG showed characteristic triphasic waves. He was treated with lactulose and rifaximin to reduce gut-derived neurotoxins, resulting in a return to his baseline cognitive function.

portal_hypertension_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Hepatopulmonary Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Progressing dyspnoea, worse when sitting upright (platypnoea)
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with PBC-related cirrhosis reported significant breathlessness and orthodeoxia (oxygen saturation dropping from 96% to 88% when standing). Contrast-enhanced "bubble" echocardiography demonstrated intrapulmonary vascular dilatations. She was diagnosed with hepatopulmonary syndrome secondary to portal hypertension and was fast-tracked for liver transplant assessment.

portal_hypertension_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC)
  presenting_complaint: Severe pruritus and fatigue
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female with AMA-positive PBC showed signs of early portal hypertension on ultrasound (splenomegaly 16cm) despite normal bilirubin and albumin levels. Gastroscopy identified small Grade I oesophageal varices. She was maintained on Ursodeoxycholic acid and Obeticholic acid, with regular surveillance for variceal progression.

portal_hypertension_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP)
  presenting_complaint: Fever, diffuse abdominal pain, and worsening jaundice
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis was admitted with acute-on-chronic liver failure. Diagnostic paracentesis revealed an ascitic neutrophil count of 450 cells/mm³, confirming SBP. He was treated with intravenous cefotaxime and albumin, and started on lifelong prophylactic norfloxacin to prevent recurrence.

portal_hypertension_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Wilson's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Tremor, dysarthria, and jaundice in a teenager
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old male presented with neurological symptoms and signs of portal hypertension. Slit-lamp examination confirmed Kayser-Fleischer rings, and 24-hour urinary copper was significantly elevated. Despite starting penicillamine, he developed decompensated cirrhosis with variceal bleeding and was successfully bridged to a liver transplant.

portal_hypertension_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Gastric Antral Vascular Ectasia (GAVE)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic iron deficiency anaemia and occult blood in stool
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old female with cirrhosis and portal hypertension presented with recurrent anaemia requiring multiple blood transfusions. Endoscopy revealed the "watermelon stomach" appearance characteristic of GAVE. She underwent several sessions of argon plasma coagulation (APC) which successfully stabilised her haemoglobin levels.

portal_hypertension_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Left-sided (Sinistral) Portal Hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Isolated gastric variceal haemorrhage
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with a history of chronic pancreatitis presented with haematemesis. Endoscopy showed large isolated gastric varices (IGV1) but no oesophageal varices. CT imaging confirmed splenic vein thrombosis with collateralisation through the short gastric veins; he underwent a splenectomy, which cured the localized portal hypertension.

portal_hypertension_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic Non-Cirrhotic Portal Hypertension (INCPH)
  presenting_complaint: Splenomegaly and variceal bleed with normal LFTs
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female presented with a significant variceal bleed. Liver biopsy showed no evidence of cirrhosis, and hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) was surprisingly low despite clinical signs of portal hypertension (pre-sinusoidal). She was diagnosed with INCPH and managed with long-term beta-blockers and endoscopic surveillance.

portal_hypertension_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Congestive Hepatopathy (Cardiac Cirrhosis)
  presenting_complaint: Pulsatile hepatomegaly and peripheral oedema
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with severe tricuspid regurgitation and chronic heart failure developed signs of portal hypertension, including mild ascites. Imaging showed a "nutmeg liver" and dilated hepatic veins. Management focused on aggressive diuresis and optimization of cardiac function, which led to a reduction in liver congestion and portal pressures.

portal_hypertension_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Ectopic Varices (Stomal)
  presenting_complaint: Profuse bleeding from an ileostomy site
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male with cirrhosis and a previous total colectomy for UC presented with life-threatening haemorrhage from around his stoma. Examination revealed "caput medusae" around the stoma site (ectopic varices). The bleeding was controlled with local pressure and subsequent TIPS insertion to reduce the underlying portal pressure.

portal_hypertension_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH)
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice and lethargy in a young adult
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female presented with acute hepatitis (ALT 1200 U/L) and signs of portal hypertension (ascites). Biopsy confirmed AIH with bridging fibrosis. She responded well to high-dose prednisolone and azathioprine, with subsequent regression of her transient portal hypertension as the hepatic inflammation subsided.

portal_hypertension_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath and abdominal distension
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with known emphysema (PiZZ phenotype) presented with new-onset ascites. Investigations confirmed cirrhosis with portal hypertension alongside his obstructive lung disease. He was managed with salt restriction and diuretics, and is being monitored for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as part of his portal hypertension care bundle.

portal_hypertension_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Portal Hypertensive Gastropathy (PHG)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic "coffee-ground" vomiting and melaena
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with long-standing HCV-related cirrhosis presented with chronic slow GI blood loss. Endoscopy showed a mosaic-like pattern of the gastric mucosa consistent with severe PHG. He was started on Propranolol to reduce portal pressures, which successfully decreased the frequency of bleeding episodes and improved his chronic anaemia.
