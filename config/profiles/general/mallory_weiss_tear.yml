  primary_diagnosis: Mallory-Weiss tear with diagnostic challenge (suspected varices)
  presenting_complaint: Large volume haematemesis in a patient with cirrhosis
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with Child-Pugh Grade B alcoholic cirrhosis presented with significant upper GI bleeding. Given his history, oesophageal varices were suspected, and he was started on intravenous terlipressin and prophylactic antibiotics. Urgent OGD, however, demonstrated a deep Mallory-Weiss tear at the gastro-oesophageal junction with no evidence of varices. The tear was treated with gold probe cautery, and terlipressin was discontinued.

  primary_diagnosis: Mallory-Weiss tear following chemotherapy-induced emesis
  presenting_complaint: Haematemesis following cycles of Cisplatin
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male undergoing chemotherapy for lung cancer developed refractory nausea and vomiting. He presented with fresh haematemesis and epigastric discomfort. OGD identified a 1cm Mallory-Weiss tear in a hiatus hernia sac, which was mildly oozing and treated with Hemospray. His antiemetic regimen was escalated to include aprepitant for future cycles.

mallory_weiss_tear_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening Mallory-Weiss tear
  presenting_complaint: Massive haematemesis and hypovolaemic shock
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male presented via ambulance in cardiac arrest following massive haematemesis; ROSC was achieved after one round of CPR. Following stabilization in the ICU with massive transfusion protocol, emergency OGD revealed a deep, extensively bleeding Mallory-Weiss tear involving an arterial branch. Dual therapy with adrenaline and thermal coagulation failed to achieve hemostasis, necessitating urgent over-the-scope clip (OTSC) placement.

mallory_weiss_tear_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Mallory-Weiss tear triggered by heavy lifting
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset haematemesis after valsalva manoeuvre
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old weightlifter experienced a sudden "tearing" sensation in his upper abdomen followed by haematemesis after a heavy squat session. He had no prior history of GI issues or alcohol use. OGD performed within 12 hours showed a classic Mallory-Weiss tear likely precipitated by increased intra-abdominal pressure. He was managed conservatively with PPIs and advised to avoid heavy lifting for two weeks.

mallory_weiss_tear_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Mallory-Weiss tear in the setting of anticoagulation
  presenting_complaint: Prolonged haematemesis while on Warfarin
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male on warfarin for atrial fibrillation (INR 3.2) presented with persistent small-volume haematemesis after a bout of retching. Despite the low volume of blood, his INR complicated the management. He received Beriplex for rapid reversal followed by OGD, which showed a persistently oozing Mallory-Weiss tear requiring mechanical clipping.

mallory_weiss_tear_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Mallory-Weiss tear complicating post-operative recovery
  presenting_complaint: Fresh blood in vomit following general anaesthetic
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female experienced severe post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) after a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. After several forceful episodes of retching on the ward, she produced 100ml of fresh blood. A bedside surgical review and subsequent OGD confirmed a Mallory-Weiss tear. She was treated with IV ondansetron and PPIs, with no further bleeding recorded.

mallory_weiss_tear_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute Mallory-Weiss tear presenting as anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Lethargy and dark stools
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male presented to his GP with a one-week history of lethargy and intermittent melaena. He recalled a severe episode of retching 10 days prior due to a "stomach bug." Blood tests revealed an iron-deficiency anaemia (Hb 88 g/L). OGD showed a healing Mallory-Weiss tear with a pigmented base, confirming the source of the subacute blood loss.

mallory_weiss_tear_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Mallory-Weiss tear associated with diabetic gastroparesis
  presenting_complaint: Repeated haematemesis and chronic nausea
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female with type 1 diabetes and known gastroparesis presented with a flare of vomiting and new-onset haematemesis. OGD revealed a 3cm Mallory-Weiss tear alongside significant food residue in the stomach. Management focused on optimizing gastric motility with prokinetics and treating the tear with endoclips to prevent re-bleeding during future vomiting episodes.

mallory_weiss_tear_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Mallory-Weiss tear with treatment failure
  presenting_complaint: Re-bleeding following initial endoscopic therapy
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male initially underwent OGD for a Mallory-Weiss tear where adrenaline was injected. Six hours later, he had a further large haematemesis and became haemodynamically unstable. A repeat OGD showed the primary tear was still bleeding; hemitabs and an endoloop were used to successfully secure the site. He remained stable for the remainder of his four-day admission.

mallory_weiss_tear_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Mallory-Weiss tear presenting as epigastric pain
  presenting_complaint: Severe sharp epigastric pain followed by coffee-ground vomit
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female presented with acute epigastric pain and coffee-ground emesis after a period of intense emotional stress and subsequent vomiting. While coffee-ground emesis usually suggests older blood, OGD within 6 hours identified a fresh Mallory-Weiss tear that had already stopped bleeding. The unusual presentation of sharp pain initially raised concerns for perforation, which was ruled out by an upright chest X-ray.

mallory_weiss_tear_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Mallory-Weiss tear in a patient with eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE)
  presenting_complaint: Haematemesis following food bolus obstruction
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male with known EoE presented with haematemesis after forceful retching to clear a food bolus. OGD showed the bolus had cleared but left a significant Mallory-Weiss tear in the fragile, inflamed distal oesophageal mucosa. He was treated with a soft diet and swallowed fluticasone to manage the underlying EoE while the tear healed.

mallory_weiss_tear_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Mallory-Weiss tear in the elderly with multiple comorbidities
  presenting_complaint: Haematemesis and syncopal episode
  summary_of_course: An 89-year-old male with heart failure, CKD Stage 4, and dementia presented after a syncopal episode and haematemesis. Initial Hb was 75 g/L; however, aggressive fluid resuscitation was limited by his heart failure. OGD was performed under careful sedation, revealing a Mallory-Weiss tear which was clipped. Despite successful haemostasis, his recovery was prolonged by an AKI-on-CKD and hospital-acquired pneumonia.

mallory_weiss_tear_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Mallory-Weiss tear triggered by iatrogenic retching
  presenting_complaint: Haematemesis during diagnostic OGD
  summary_of_course: During a routine OGD for dyspepsia in a 58-year-old male, the patient experienced severe retching and "fighting" the scope. The endoscopist noted the sudden appearance of a fresh mucosal laceration and active bleeding at the gastro-oesophageal junction that was not present on initial entry. The iatrogenic Mallory-Weiss tear was immediately treated with a single clip, and the patient was monitored for 4 hours post-procedure before being discharged.

mallory_weiss_tear_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Mallory-Weiss tear with associated oesophagitis
  presenting_complaint: Heartburn followed by small volume haematemesis
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male with a history of GORD and heavy smoking presented with fresh blood in his saliva and vomit after a night of severe reflux and retching. OGD showed Grade C reflux oesophagitis and a 1cm Mallory-Weiss tear located within an area of mucosal friability. He was started on twice-daily PPI therapy and lifestyle modifications, with a follow-up OGD scheduled for 8 weeks to ensure healing of the oesophagitis.
