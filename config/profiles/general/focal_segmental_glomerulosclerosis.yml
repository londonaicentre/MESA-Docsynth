focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (NOS variant)
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral leg swelling and foamy urine.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male presented with a two-week history of worsening peripheral oedema and frothy urine. Investigations revealed nephrotic-range proteinuria (8.5g/24h), hypoalbuminaemia (22g/L), and normal renal function. Renal biopsy confirmed FSGS, Not Otherwise Specified (NOS) variant; he was commenced on high-dose oral prednisolone, achieving complete remission after 12 weeks of therapy.

focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Steroid-Resistant Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent generalised swelling and lethargy.
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old girl with known nephrotic syndrome failed to respond to an 8-week course of prednisolone. Clinical examination showed gross ascites and scrotal oedema; biopsy demonstrated segmental sclerosis in 3 of 15 glomeruli. Genetic testing was negative for podocin mutations, and she was transitioned to Ciclosporin with partial reduction in proteinuria.

focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: HIV-Associated Nephropathy (HIVAN)
  presenting_complaint: Acute kidney injury and heavy proteinuria.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old Afro-Caribbean male, recently diagnosed with HIV (CD4 count 150 cells/uL), presented with a rapid rise in serum creatinine from 90 to 350 umol/L. Renal biopsy showed the collapsing variant of FSGS with microcystic tubular dilatation. He was urgently started on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and ACE inhibitors, resulting in stabilisation of renal function.

focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Obesity-Related Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of proteinuria on routine screening.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with a BMI of 42 kg/m2 was found to have 2+ proteinuria during a diabetic screen, despite normal glycaemic control. Biopsy revealed glomerulomegaly and hilar segmental sclerosis consistent with secondary FSGS due to hyperfiltration. Management focused on weight loss and intensive blood pressure control with Ramipril, leading to a 50% reduction in protein excretion.

focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent FSGS post-Renal Transplant
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset graft dysfunction and massive proteinuria.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female, 4 days post-live donor renal transplant for ESRD secondary to FSGS, developed sudden-onset proteinuria (15g/24h). Urgent graft biopsy confirmed early recurrence of FSGS with extensive podocyte foot process effacement on electron microscopy. She underwent intensive plasma exchange and Rituximab therapy, resulting in graft salvage and significant clinical improvement.

focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Collapsing Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (COVID-19 associated)
  presenting_complaint: Oliguria and breathlessness following viral illness.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male of West African descent presented with acute respiratory distress and anuria three weeks after a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. Laboratory tests showed a creatinine of 850 umol/L and nephrotic-range proteinuria; biopsy confirmed collapsing FSGS. Despite corticosteroid treatment and haemodialysis, he remained dialysis-dependent at 3 months follow-up.

focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary FSGS due to Reflux Nephropathy
  presenting_complaint: Chronic hypertension and mild uraemic symptoms.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female with a childhood history of vesicoureteral reflux presented with a blood pressure of 165/105 mmHg and a creatinine of 180 umol/L. Ultrasound showed small, scarred kidneys, and biopsy of the larger kidney revealed FSGS secondary to reduced nephron mass. She was managed conservatively with Losartan and bicarbonate supplementation to slow progression of chronic kidney disease.

focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Heroin-Associated Nephropathy (FSGS)
  presenting_complaint: Severe leg oedema and skin infections.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male with a long history of intravenous heroin use presented with anasarca and a serum albumin of 18g/L. Renal biopsy demonstrated advanced FSGS with significant interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA). Management was complicated by poor compliance, eventually leading to the initiation of maintenance haemodialysis within six months of diagnosis.

focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Tip Variant Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of nephrotic syndrome.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female presented with acute onset periorbital and pedal oedema. Biopsy showed segmental lesions at the tubular pole, characteristic of the 'tip variant' of FSGS. She showed an excellent and rapid response to oral corticosteroids, achieving complete remission within 4 weeks, which is typical for this specific histological subtype.

focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Genetic FSGS (NPHS2 mutation)
  presenting_complaint: Early-onset nephrotic syndrome unresponsive to steroids.
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old boy presented with persistent proteinuria from age 18 months. After failing both steroids and Tacrolimus, genetic sequencing identified a homozygous mutation in the NPHS2 gene encoding podocin. Given the known poor response of genetic FSGS to immunosuppression, treatment was shifted to supportive care with ACE inhibition to delay the inevitable progression to ESRD.

focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary FSGS due to Anabolic Steroid Abuse
  presenting_complaint: Elevated creatinine found during insurance medical.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male bodybuilder was found to have a creatinine of 210 umol/L and 4g/day proteinuria. History revealed long-term use of high-dose testosterone and trenbolone; biopsy showed FSGS with glomerulomegaly. Following cessation of anabolic steroids and initiation of Enalapril, his renal function stabilised and proteinuria decreased to 1.2g/day.

focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Perihilar Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Long-standing hypertension and proteinuria.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with a 30-year history of poorly controlled hypertension presented with a rising creatinine (240 umol/L). Biopsy showed perihilar segmental sclerosis and significant hyaline arteriolosclerosis. This was interpreted as secondary FSGS due to hypertensive nephrosclerosis, and management focused on strict BP targets and statin therapy.

focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: FSGS with Acute Thromboembolic Complication
  presenting_complaint: Pleuritic chest pain and haemoptysis.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with known FSGS and albumin of 15g/L presented acutely with a pulmonary embolism. Despite being on prophylactic dalteparin, she developed a large thrombus in the right lower lobe. She required therapeutic anticoagulation with Warfarin and intensification of her nephrotic syndrome management with Mycophenolate Mofetil.

focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Pamidronate-Induced Collapsing FSGS
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly declining renal function.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male receiving high-dose intravenous pamidronate for multiple myeloma developed acute kidney injury (creatinine 400 umol/L) and 10g/day proteinuria. Renal biopsy showed collapsing FSGS, a known rare complication of bisphosphonate therapy. The drug was discontinued, and a course of steroids was initiated, leading to a partial recovery of renal function.

focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: FSGS in a Solitary Kidney
  presenting_complaint: Progressive proteinuria 10 years after nephrectomy.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female who underwent a left nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma a decade ago presented with new-onset 3g/day proteinuria. Biopsy of the solitary right kidney showed FSGS, attributed to chronic hyperfiltration and compensatory hypertrophy. Treatment with a SGLT2 inhibitor and ACE inhibitor was started to reduce intraglomerular pressure.

focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Cellular Variant Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Gross haematuria and nephrotic syndrome.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male presented with visible haematuria and severe peripheral oedema. Biopsy revealed the cellular variant of FSGS, characterised by endocapillary hypercellularity and segmental occlusion of the capillary lumina. He was treated with a combination of high-dose steroids and Cyclophosphamide due to the aggressive histological features, achieving partial remission.

focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: FSGS secondary to Sickle Cell Disease
  presenting_complaint: Chronic anaemia and increasing proteinuria.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with HbSS sickle cell disease presented with a baseline creatinine of 110 umol/L and 5g/day proteinuria. Biopsy confirmed FSGS, likely secondary to chronic ischaemic injury and hyperfiltration associated with sickle cell nephropathy. Management included hydroxycarbamide, chronic transfusions, and ACE inhibition to manage the proteinuric drive.

focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: FSGS with Superimposed Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN)
  presenting_complaint: Sepsis and profound oliguria.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female with pre-existing FSGS was admitted with urosepsis and developed Stage 3 AKI. Biopsy performed after failure to recover function showed the underlying segmental sclerosis with extensive acute tubular injury and flattening of the epithelium. Following a period of haemofiltration in the ICU and resolution of sepsis, she returned to her baseline CKD stage 4.

focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic FSGS (Steroid-Dependent)
  presenting_complaint: Relapse of oedema upon tapering prednisolone.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old woman with biopsy-proven FSGS (NOS) initially responded well to 60mg prednisolone. However, each attempt to reduce the dose below 15mg resulted in a relapse of nephrotic syndrome. She was eventually transitioned to Tacrolimus as a steroid-sparing agent, which successfully maintained remission and allowed for the cessation of steroids.

focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Advanced FSGS with Uraemic Pericarditis
  presenting_complaint: Chest pain, friction rub, and severe lethargy.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with undiagnosed chronic kidney disease presented in extremis with a pericardial friction rub and a creatinine of 1200 umol/L. Post-stabilisation on dialysis, a renal biopsy showed 90% global glomerulosclerosis with the remaining 10% showing segmental scars consistent with burnt-out FSGS. He was transitioned to long-term palliative haemodialysis.
