heparin_induced_thrombocytopenia_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) Type II
  presenting_complaint: Routine post-operative blood monitoring showing significant platelet drop.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male underwent elective total hip replacement and was started on prophylactic dalteparin. On post-operative day 7, his platelet count fell from 240 to 95 x 10^9/L (60% drop). 4Ts score was 6 (high probability); heparin was ceased and argatroban commenced. ELISA for anti-PF4 antibodies was strongly positive, confirming HIT without thrombotic complications.

heparin_induced_thrombocytopenia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset painful, cold, and pale left lower limb.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female was receiving unfractionated heparin (UFH) for a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. On day 5 of infusion, she developed acute limb ischaemia; platelets had plummeted from 310 to 45 x 10^9/L. Urgent embolectomy was performed alongside a switch to danaparoid. Functional SRA (serotonin release assay) confirmed HIT, and she was transitioned to warfarin only after platelet recovery.

heparin_induced_thrombocytopenia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Delayed-onset heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
  presenting_complaint: New onset swelling of the right calf and shortness of breath.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male was discharged 10 days ago following cardiac bypass surgery where he received intraoperative UFH. He presented to A&E with a confirmed DVT and segmental PE; admission platelets were 52 x 10^9/L despite no recent heparin exposure. High-titre anti-PF4 antibodies were detected, and he was successfully treated with fondaparinux.

heparin_induced_thrombocytopenia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-onset heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
  presenting_complaint: Shivering, tachycardia, and hypertension immediately following heparin bolus.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with a history of heparin exposure three weeks prior was given a UFH bolus for haemodialysis. Within 30 minutes, he developed an acute systemic reaction and his platelet count dropped by 70% from baseline. This rapid onset HIT was managed by immediate cessation of all heparin flushes and switching to regional citrate anticoagulation for dialysis.

heparin_induced_thrombocytopenia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with skin necrosis
  presenting_complaint: Painful, purple skin lesions at abdominal injection sites.
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old female receiving prophylactic enoxaparin for immobility developed erythematous plaques that progressed to skin necrosis at the injection sites on day 8. Platelet count was 110 x 10^9/L (baseline 280). Clinical diagnosis of HIT was made; she was switched to argatroban and the lesions slowly healed with local wound care.

heparin_induced_thrombocytopenia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent clotting of a central venous catheter.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old girl post-Fontan procedure required UFH flushes for line patency. After 9 days, the line repeatedly occluded and her platelets dropped from 400 to 120 x 10^9/L. HIT was confirmed via positive PF4-heparin immunoassay. She was managed with bivalirudin infusion until platelets stabilised.

heparin_induced_thrombocytopenia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
  presenting_complaint: Persistent thrombocytopenia despite stopping heparin.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male developed HIT following vascular surgery. Despite stopping heparin and starting danaparoid, his platelets remained <20 x 10^9/L for two weeks with ongoing microvascular thrombosis. He required intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) to interrupt the prothrombotic state, leading to a gradual recovery of platelet counts.

heparin_induced_thrombocytopenia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with bilateral adrenal haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and hypotension.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male on UFH for AF developed sudden abdominal pain on day 6. CT abdomen revealed bilateral adrenal haemorrhages, and labs showed a platelet count of 88 x 10^9/L. HIT-induced adrenal vein thrombosis was diagnosed; he required lifelong steroid replacement and anticoagulation with argatroban followed by apixaban.

heparin_induced_thrombocytopenia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in ICU
  presenting_complaint: Falling platelet count in a septic patient.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female in the ICU for urosepsis was receiving LMWH for VTE prophylaxis. Her platelets fell from 180 to 60 x 10^9/L; though sepsis was a confounder, the 4Ts score was 5. HIT ELISA was positive (OD 2.4), and switching from LMWH to argatroban resulted in platelet recovery despite ongoing infection.

heparin_induced_thrombocytopenia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia presenting as CVST
  presenting_complaint: Severe headache, blurred vision, and a focal seizure.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female on heparin for a post-operative DVT presented with neurological symptoms on day 9. MRI/MRV confirmed cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) and her platelets were 75 x 10^9/L. She was treated with argatroban and eventually transitioned to dabigatran, with significant improvement in neurological status.

heparin_induced_thrombocytopenia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Spontaneous heparin-induced thrombocytopenia syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Extensive DVT and thrombocytopenia without recent heparin exposure.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male presented with a massive iliofemoral DVT and a platelet count of 40 x 10^9/L. He had not received heparin in years but had a recent total knee replacement 3 weeks prior under spinal anaesthesia. High-titre anti-PF4 antibodies were found that were heparin-independent in SRA, confirming spontaneous HIT; he was treated with IVIG and fondaparinux.

heparin_induced_thrombocytopenia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Low platelets on routine antenatal screening.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old pregnant female at 28 weeks gestation was on enoxaparin for a previous VTE. Her platelets dropped from 210 to 90 x 10^9/L over 5 days. After HIT was confirmed by ELISA, she was switched to danaparoid for the remainder of her pregnancy and delivery, as it does not cross the placenta.

heparin_induced_thrombocytopenia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with mesenteric ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Acute, severe post-prandial abdominal pain.
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old male post-CABG on UFH developed acute mesenteric ischaemia on day 7. Platelets were 55 x 10^9/L. Laparotomy showed ischaemic bowel segments; HIT was confirmed, and he was managed with argatroban and bowel resection, though his recovery was complicated by multi-organ failure.

heparin_induced_thrombocytopenia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (Type I)
  presenting_complaint: Slight drop in platelets within 48 hours of heparin initiation.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male started on UFH for a PE saw his platelets drop from 250 to 190 x 10^9/L on day 2. The 4Ts score was low (2), and platelets stabilised and then rose despite continuing heparin. This was diagnosed as HIT Type I (non-immune), and no change in therapy was required.

heparin_induced_thrombocytopenia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with myocardial infarction
  presenting_complaint: New onset chest pain and ST-elevation on ECG.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female being treated for a DVT with LMWH developed an acute STEMI on day 8 of treatment. Her platelet count was found to be 65 x 10^9/L. Coronary angiography showed acute thrombus in the LAD; she was managed with bivalirudin during PCI and avoided further heparin.

heparin_induced_thrombocytopenia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia during ECMO
  presenting_complaint: Sudden clotting of the oxygenator circuit.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male on VA-ECMO for cardiogenic shock required continuous UFH. On day 6, the oxygenator failed due to massive thrombosis and his platelets dropped to 30 x 10^9/L. HIT was confirmed; the circuit was replaced and anticoagulation was switched to argatroban, titrated to maintain a steady APTT.

heparin_induced_thrombocytopenia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with venous limb gangrene
  presenting_complaint: Blackening of the toes on a limb with known DVT.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with HIT and DVT was prematurely started on warfarin while his platelet count was still 40 x 10^9/L. This led to a rapid depletion of Protein C and subsequent venous limb gangrene. Warfarin was reversed with Vitamin K and prothrombin complex concentrate, and he was stabilised on argatroban until platelets exceeded 150 x 10^9/L.

heparin_induced_thrombocytopenia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia post-vascular graft
  presenting_complaint: Acute occlusion of a newly placed femoral-popliteal graft.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male underwent peripheral vascular bypass. On day 5, the graft occluded despite LMWH prophylaxis, and platelets were 72 x 10^9/L. HIT ELISA was positive; the patient was managed with argatroban and surgical thrombectomy, successfully salvaging the limb.

heparin_induced_thrombocytopenia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (False Positive ELISA)
  presenting_complaint: Drop in platelets in a complex surgical patient.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female post-abdominal surgery had a platelet drop from 300 to 140 x 10^9/L on day 6. HIT ELISA was weakly positive (OD 0.6), but the SRA was negative. Given the low clinical suspicion (4Ts score 3), heparin was briefly paused but then restarted when SRA came back negative, with platelets subsequently recovering on their own.

heparin_induced_thrombocytopenia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with pulmonary embolism
  presenting_complaint: Sudden pleuritic chest pain and haemoptysis.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male on UFH for a leg fracture developed a new PE on day 10. Platelets had fallen from 280 to 110 x 10^9/L. HIT was confirmed by a high-titre ELISA and positive SRA. He was successfully treated with fondaparinux and discharged on edoxaban after platelet recovery.
