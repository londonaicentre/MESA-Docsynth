umbilical_hernia_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Reducible paediatric umbilical_hernia
  presenting_complaint: Protrusion at the navel when crying or straining.
  summary_of_course: An 18-month-old male was brought to the GP by his mother who noticed a 1.5cm bulge at the umbilicus. The hernia is easily reducible and non-tender. The parents were reassured that most paediatric umbilical hernias close spontaneously by age 4-5, and a watchful waiting approach was adopted.

umbilical_hernia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Symptomatic adult umbilical_hernia
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent umbilical pain and a persistent lump.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male manual labourer presented with a 2cm umbilical defect. He reported worsening discomfort when lifting heavy crates at work. He underwent an elective open primary suture repair under general anaesthesia and returned to light duties after two weeks.

umbilical_hernia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Strangulated umbilical_hernia
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and an irreducible, discoloured umbilical lump.
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old female with a long-standing hernia presented acutely to A&E with signs of small bowel obstruction. Emergency laparotomy revealed a strangulated loop of ileum requiring a 10cm resection and primary anastomosis. She was discharged after five days following a slow recovery from postoperative ileus.

umbilical_hernia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Spontaneous rupture of umbilical_hernia (Flood syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden leakage of clear fluid from the umbilicus.
  summary_of_course: A 56-year-old male with decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis and tense ascites presented with spontaneous drainage of ascitic fluid from a thinned umbilical hernia sac. He was admitted to the ICU for management of potential spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and underwent urgent surgical closure of the defect once stabilised.

umbilical_hernia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-partum umbilical_hernia with diastasis recti
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal wall deformity and midline bulge following pregnancy.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female, six months post-twin delivery, presented with a 3cm umbilical hernia associated with significant diastasis recti. Ultrasound confirmed the defect size and lack of incarceration. She underwent a laparoscopic mesh repair (IPOM) to address both the hernia and the weakened linea alba.

umbilical_hernia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Incarcerated umbilical_hernia with omental infarction
  presenting_complaint: Constant, dull umbilical pain and a firm, non-reducible lump.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female with a BMI of 48 presented with a tender, irreducible umbilical mass. CT imaging showed incarcerated omentum without bowel involvement. Surgical exploration confirmed infarcted omentum, which was excised, followed by a sublay mesh repair.

umbilical_hernia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent umbilical_hernia
  presenting_complaint: Recurrence of a lump at the site of a previous repair.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male who had a primary suture repair three years ago presented with a recurrent 4cm defect. Given the recurrence and his history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), he underwent a complex repair using a large retromuscular synthetic mesh. His recovery was complicated by a superficial wound infection treated with oral antibiotics.

umbilical_hernia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Infected umbilical_hernia sac
  presenting_complaint: Redness, warmth, and purulent discharge from the umbilical area.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes presented with intertrigo and cellulitis over a large, chronic umbilical hernia. He was treated with intravenous flucloxacillin and optimized glycaemic control before being scheduled for an elective repair once the infection had completely resolved.

umbilical_hernia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Incarcerated umbilical_hernia in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Painful umbilical lump at 32 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old pregnant female presented with an acutely tender, irreducible umbilical hernia. Conservative management with bed rest and gentle reduction was successful, avoiding emergency surgery. She was scheduled for an elective repair six months postpartum.

umbilical_hernia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Large umbilical_hernia with loss of domain
  presenting_complaint: Massive abdominal protrusion causing back pain and skin breakdown.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male presented with a 15cm umbilical hernia that had been neglected for decades. Pre-operative CT showed significant "loss of domain" with multiple loops of small bowel in the sac. He was managed conservatively with a bespoke abdominal binder as he was deemed too high-risk for complex abdominal wall reconstruction.

umbilical_hernia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Richter’s type umbilical_hernia
  presenting_complaint: Localised umbilical pain but normal bowel habits.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female presented with a small, hard umbilical nodule. Despite the absence of obstructive symptoms, CT revealed a Richter’s hernia where only the antimesenteric border of the ileum was trapped. Urgent surgery prevented full-thickness necrosis, and the bowel was salvaged without resection.

umbilical_hernia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Umbilical port-site hernia
  presenting_complaint: New lump at the site of a previous laparoscopic scar.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female, one year post-laparoscopic cholecystectomy, developed a hernia through the 10mm umbilical port site. The defect was confirmed on ultrasound. She underwent an elective laparoscopic-assisted repair using a composite mesh.

umbilical_hernia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Umbilical_hernia with overlying skin necrosis
  presenting_complaint: Dark discolouration of the skin over a long-standing umbilical lump.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old morbidly obese male presented with a 10cm hernia where the overlying skin had become ischaemic due to pressure. He required emergency debridement of the necrotic skin and a primary repair of the defect. The wound was left to heal by secondary intention with vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy.

umbilical_hernia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic umbilical_hernia in a frail elderly patient
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent discomfort and a large umbilical bulge.
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old female with advanced dementia and heart failure was referred by her nursing home. Given her multiple comorbidities and the reducible nature of the hernia, a multidisciplinary decision was made for non-operative management. A soft abdominal support garment was provided for comfort.

umbilical_hernia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Traumatic umbilical_hernia
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of an umbilical lump following a seatbelt injury.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male was involved in a high-speed road traffic accident. CT trauma scan revealed a traumatic disruption of the umbilical fascia with herniation of mesenteric fat. He underwent an urgent laparotomy which addressed both the hernia and a minor mesenteric haematoma.

umbilical_hernia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric umbilical_hernia with failed closure
  presenting_complaint: Persistent umbilical defect in a school-aged child.
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old girl was referred as her umbilical hernia had failed to close spontaneously. The defect was 2cm and caused her distress during physical education classes. She underwent an elective "purse-string" suture closure as a day-case procedure with excellent cosmetic results.

umbilical_hernia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Umbilical_hernia with enterocutaneous fistula
  presenting_complaint: Faeculent drainage from the umbilicus.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with a history of multiple abdominal surgeries presented with a chronic umbilical hernia that had developed a fistula. Imaging confirmed a connection between the ileum and the skin surface. She required a complex multidisciplinary staged repair involving bowel resection and biological mesh placement.

umbilical_hernia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Incarcerated umbilical_hernia with systemic sepsis
  presenting_complaint: Fever, tachycardia, and a red, painful umbilical mass.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented in septic shock with a strangulated umbilical hernia. Intraoperatively, the hernia sac contained gangrenous small bowel and purulent fluid. Following resection and thorough peritoneal lavage, the fascia was closed primarily, and he received a prolonged course of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

umbilical_hernia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Small symptomatic umbilical_hernia (pre-peritoneal fat)
  presenting_complaint: Sharp, localized pain at the umbilicus, worse on coughing.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female athlete presented with focal umbilical pain but no visible lump. Ultrasound identified a tiny 5mm fascial defect with incarcerated pre-peritoneal fat. A simple primary suture repair under local anaesthetic completely resolved her symptoms.

umbilical_hernia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Umbilical_hernia with mesh migration
  presenting_complaint: Chronic abdominal pain and a palpable hard mass near the umbilicus.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male, five years post-mesh repair, presented with new-onset localized pain. Imaging and subsequent exploration revealed that the synthetic mesh had partially eroded into the subcutaneous tissue. The mesh was removed, and the defect was reconstructed using an autologous transversus abdominis release (TAR) technique.
