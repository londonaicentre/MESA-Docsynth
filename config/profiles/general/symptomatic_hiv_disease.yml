symptomatic_hiv_disease_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Cutaneous Kaposi Sarcoma
  presenting_complaint: Multiple painless purple skin lesions
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old male presented to the sexual health clinic with several non-blanching, violaceous nodules on his lower limbs and hard palate. Skin biopsy confirmed a spindle cell proliferation consistent with Kaposi Sarcoma associated with HHV-8. His HIV viral load was 150,000 copies/mL; initiation of ART led to gradual regression of the lesions without the need for systemic chemotherapy.

symptomatic_hiv_disease_008:
  primary_diagnosis: HIV-associated Nephropathy (HIVAN)
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral leg swelling and foamy urine
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male of African descent presented with nephrotic-range proteinuria (uPCR 850 mg/mmol) and rapidly declining renal function.

  primary_diagnosis: HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive memory loss and social withdrawal
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male on long-term ART with a suppressed viral load complained of increasing difficulty with complex tasks and personality changes. Neuropsychological testing confirmed deficits in executive function and processing speed, while MRI showed diffuse white matter hyperintensities. His ART regimen was adjusted to include drugs with better CNS penetration (high CPE score), resulting in mild cognitive stabilisation.

symptomatic_hiv_disease_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Retinitis
  presenting_complaint: Blurred vision and "floaters" in the left eye
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female with a CD4 count of 18 cells/uL reported a painless decrease in visual acuity. Fundoscopy revealed characteristic "pizza-pie" haemorrhagic retinitis and perivascular whitening. She received intravitreal ganciclovir injections and systemic valganciclovir to prevent bilateral blindness while waiting for immune reconstitution after starting ART.

symptomatic_hiv_disease_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary CNS Lymphoma
  presenting_complaint: Persistent headache and cognitive slowing
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male presented with a 2-week history of lethargy and dull headache. MRI brain showed a single, large, periventricular enhancing lesion (4cm) with mass effect; CSF PCR was positive for Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV).

  presenting_complaint: Worsening fever and lymph node swelling after starting ART
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male with known HIV/TB co-infection started ART four weeks after commencing anti-tuberculous therapy. He subsequently developed high fevers and a painful, fluctuant cervical lymph node mass despite clinical improvement in respiratory symptoms. Diagnosis of paradoxical IRIS was made; he was managed with needle aspiration of the node and a short course of prednisolone without stopping ART.

symptomatic_hiv_disease_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Multidrug-Resistant HIV Infection
  presenting_complaint: Persistently high viral load despite triple therapy
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female with a 20-year history of HIV showed a rising viral load (45,000 copies/mL) despite reported adherence. Genotypic resistance testing revealed multiple mutations including M184V, K103N, and Q151M complex, indicating resistance to NRTIs and NNRTIs. Her regimen was switched to a salvage therapy including dolutegravir (twice daily), darunavir/ritonavir, and maraviroc.

symptomatic_hiv_disease_015:
  primary_diagnosis: HIV Wasting Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Chronic diarrhoea and involuntary weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 47-year-old male presented with a 15% loss of body weight over 6 months and persistent loose stools (4-6 times daily). Extensive workup for enteric pathogens was negative, and malabsorption was attributed to HIV enteropathy. He was managed with optimized ART, high-protein nutritional supplements, and testosterone replacement for associated hypogonadism.

CXR showed upper lobe cavitation and miliary shadowing; sputum smear was 3+ positive for Acid-Fast Bacilli (AFB). He was diagnosed with HIV (CD4 120 cells/uL) and started on RIPE therapy (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol), with ART delayed by 2 weeks to reduce IRIS risk.

symptomatic_hiv_disease_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive ataxia and left-sided neglect
  summary_of_course: A 49-year-old female with undiagnosed HIV presented with worsening coordination and visual field defects. MRI showed multifocal, non-enhancing white matter lesions without mass effect, and CSF PCR was positive for JC virus. Despite immediate initiation of ART to restore immune function, she suffered significant permanent neurological disability.

symptomatic_hiv_disease_018:
  primary_diagnosis: HIV-related Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)
  presenting_complaint: Spontaneous epistaxis and easy bruising
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old female presented with a petechial rash on her shins and a platelet count of 8 x 10^9/L. Routine screening during the ITP workup revealed a new diagnosis of HIV (CD4 410 cells/uL). Her platelet count normalised within 4 weeks of starting ART, confirming HIV-associated secondary ITP.

symptomatic_hiv_disease_019:
  primary_diagnosis: HIV-related Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly enlarging neck mass and night sweats
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with long-term HIV presented with a 5cm firm, fixed cervical lymph node. Excisional biopsy confirmed Burkitt-like high-grade B-cell lymphoma. He underwent intensive chemotherapy (R-CODOX-M/IVAC) alongside ART, achieving a complete metabolic remission on PET-CT at 6 months.

symptomatic_hiv_disease_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Cryptosporidiosis
  presenting_complaint: Profuse, watery diarrhoea and abdominal cramping
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male with a CD4 count of 25 cells/uL presented with 10-15 episodes of watery diarrhoea per day, leading to severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Stool microscopy using modified acid-fast staining identified Cryptosporidium oocysts. Symptoms only resolved after several months of ART-induced immune reconstitution (CD4 >100 cells/uL), as nitazoxanide had limited efficacy.
