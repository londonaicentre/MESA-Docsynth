  presenting_complaint: Progressive headache over 5 days and blurred vision
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female on the combined oral contraceptive pill presented with subacute intracranial hypertension. MRV confirmed thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus with a secondary left parasagittal venous haemorrhage.

  primary_diagnosis: Septic embolic intracerebral haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Fever and acute left-sided neglect
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old intravenous drug user presented with pyrexia and signs of right parietal lobe dysfunction. Echocardiography showed mitral valve vegetations, and CT head confirmed a lobar haemorrhage likely secondary to a ruptured mycotic aneurysm. He was treated with long-term intravenous antibiotics and underwent delayed endovascular coiling of the residual aneurysm.

  primary_diagnosis: Intracerebral haemorrhage secondary to metastatic melanoma
  presenting_complaint: New onset focal motor seizures
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with a history of cutaneous melanoma presented with seizures. Imaging revealed a haemorrhagic lesion in the left motor cortex with significant perilesional oedema. Biopsy confirmed metastatic melanoma within the haematoma cavity, and he was commenced on high-dose dexamethasone and palliative radiotherapy.

intracerebral_haemorrhage_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-partum eclampsia-related intracerebral haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Post-partum seizure and persistent focal deficit
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female, 3 days post-emergency C-section for pre-eclampsia, suffered a tonic-clonic seizure. CT head showed bilateral small subcortical haemorrhages in the occipital lobes (consistent with HELLP/PRES spectrum). She was managed with magnesium sulphate and aggressive antihypertensives, with near-complete resolution of deficits at 6-week follow-up.

  primary_diagnosis: Chronic intracerebral haemorrhage with haemosiderin deposition
  presenting_complaint: Routine follow-up for previous stroke
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male attended an outpatient clinic 6 months after a spontaneous ICH. MRI showed a well-defined cavity in the right basal ganglia with a peripheral rim of haemosiderin on T2* sequences. He remains on monotherapy for hypertension and has residual left-sided spasticity managed by community neuro-physiotherapy.

intracerebral_haemorrhage_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic intracerebral haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Worsening of pre-existing left-sided weakness
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with a history of a previous right putaminal bleed presented with acute clinical decline. CT showed fresh hyperdense blood within the margins of an old encephalomalacic cavity. This re-bleeding was attributed to a hypertensive crisis (BP 230/130), requiring intensive care stabilisation.

  presenting_complaint: Recurrent TIAs followed by sudden right-sided hemiparesis
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female of East Asian descent presented with an acute ICH in the left caudate nucleus.

  presenting_complaint: Subacute encephalopathy and multifocal neurological deficits
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male with Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) developed progressive confusion. MRI demonstrated multiple small areas of intraparenchymal haemorrhage across different vascular territories. Brain biopsy confirmed CNS vasculitis, and he was treated with pulsed methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide, leading to clinical stabilisation.

  primary_diagnosis: Post-procedural iatrogenic intracerebral haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Failure to wake post-craniotomy for tumour resection
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female underwent elective resection of a meningioma. Post-operatively, she failed to regain consciousness, and an immediate CT showed a large haematoma at the surgical site with significant mass effect. She returned to theatre for evacuation of the clot and haemostasis, followed by a prolonged ICU recovery.

  primary_diagnosis: Mild spontaneous subcortical haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Isolated "clumsy hand" and mild headache
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male presented with minor incoordination of the left hand. CT showed a tiny (4mm) haemorrhage in the right subcortical white matter. Extensive workup, including MRA, was negative for vascular malformations, and he was discharged on day 3 with outpatient BP monitoring.
