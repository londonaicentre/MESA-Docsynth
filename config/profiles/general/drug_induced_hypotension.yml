  primary_diagnosis: "Verapamil toxicity"
  presenting_complaint: "Shock and altered mental status"
  summary_of_course: "A 40-year-old female ingested 2.4g of Verapamil SR. She presented with profound hypotension (65/35 mmHg) and third-degree heart block. Treatment involved intravenous calcium gluconate, transvenous pacing, and a multi-modal vasopressor approach in the ICU, as the sustained-release formulation led to prolonged toxicity."

  presenting_complaint: "Syncope following the first dose of medication"
  summary_of_course: "A 72-year-old male was started on Tamsulosin 400mcg for benign prostatic hyperplasia. He collapsed in his bathroom four hours after the first dose, with an emergency department blood pressure of 92/52 mmHg.

  primary_diagnosis: "Magnesium sulphate-induced hypotension"
  presenting_complaint: "Lethargy and loss of deep tendon reflexes"
  summary_of_course: "A 29-year-old female being treated for pre-eclampsia received an intravenous Magnesium sulphate loading dose. During the infusion, her blood pressure fell from 165/105 to 88/48 mmHg, accompanied by a reduced respiratory rate.

  presenting_complaint: "Increased confusion and dizziness"
  summary_of_course: "An 80-year-old female with dementia-related agitation was started on Quetiapine 25mg twice daily. She developed significant postural instability and a sitting blood pressure of 94/54 mmHg. Due to the high risk of hip fracture from falls, the Quetiapine was tapered off, and her blood pressure returned to her baseline of 125/75 mmHg."
