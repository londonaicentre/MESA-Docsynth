wolff_parkinson_white_syndrome_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White Pattern
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding on routine ECG for sports clearance
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old male athlete underwent screening which revealed a short PR interval and a characteristic delta wave. He is currently asymptomatic with no history of syncope or palpitations. Following a normal exercise stress test showing abrupt disappearance of pre-excitation at high heart rates, he was classified as low risk and remains under annual outpatient review.

wolff_parkinson_white_syndrome_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Orthodromic Atrioventricular Re-entrant Tachycardia (AVRT)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset rapid palpitations and lightheadedness
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female presented to A&E with a narrow-complex tachycardia at 190 bpm. Vagal manoeuvres were unsuccessful, but the rhythm reverted to sinus with 6mg of intravenous adenosine, subsequently revealing a manifest WPW pattern. She has been referred for elective radiofrequency catheter ablation of a left-sided accessory pathway.

wolff_parkinson_white_syndrome_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations, chest pain, and near-syncope
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with a known history of WPW presented acutely with an irregular, wide-complex tachycardia and hypotension (BP 88/54 mmHg). ECG confirmed atrial fibrillation with rapid conduction over an accessory pathway (pre-excited AF). He underwent successful emergent direct current (DC) cardioversion in the resuscitation bay and was started on flecainide pending urgent EP study.

wolff_parkinson_white_syndrome_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome with Ebstein's Anomaly
  presenting_complaint: Progressive dyspnoea and intermittent racing heart
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old girl with known Ebstein’s anomaly presented with worsening exercise intolerance and documented SVT. Investigations confirmed multiple accessory pathways, a common feature in this congenital cardiac condition. She underwent a complex electrophysiological procedure involving the ablation of three distinct right-sided pathways, resulting in significant symptomatic improvement.

wolff_parkinson_white_syndrome_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Infantile Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Poor feeding, irritability, and tachypnoea
  summary_of_course: A 4-month-old infant was brought to the paediatric assessment unit with signs of congestive heart failure. ECG revealed a heart rate of 280 bpm, which was terminated using an ice pack to the face (diving reflex). He was commenced on propranolol and has remained stable with no further episodes of SVT during 6 months of follow-up.

wolff_parkinson_white_syndrome_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Concealed Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old female presented with frequent episodes of palpitations despite a normal resting 12-lead ECG. Electrophysiological (EP) study demonstrated a concealed accessory pathway capable only of retrograde conduction, facilitating orthodromic AVRT. Successful radiofrequency ablation of the pathway at the mitral annulus was performed, with no recurrence of symptoms at 12 months.

wolff_parkinson_white_syndrome_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Antidromic Atrioventricular Re-entrant Tachycardia
  presenting_complaint: Regular wide-complex tachycardia and breathlessness
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male presented with a stable wide-complex tachycardia that was initially misidentified as ventricular tachycardia (VT). Careful ECG analysis suggested antidromic AVRT due to WPW, which was later confirmed when sinus rhythm revealed a manifest delta wave. He underwent successful ablation of a right-sided free wall pathway.

wolff_parkinson_white_syndrome_008:
  primary_diagnosis: WPW Syndrome with Tachycardia-Induced Cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Chronic fatigue and peripheral oedema
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented with signs of biventricular heart failure and persistent tachycardia. Echocardiography showed a reduced LVEF of 30%, and prolonged monitoring revealed frequent, long-lasting episodes of subclinical AVRT. Following successful ablation of the accessory pathway, his LVEF recovered to 55% over the subsequent six months, confirming tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.

wolff_parkinson_white_syndrome_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent palpitations during the second trimester
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old pregnant woman experienced frequent symptomatic SVT episodes. Due to the pregnancy, pharmacological management was prioritised with cardioselective beta-blockers, and DC cardioversion was kept as a rescue option. She was managed conservatively through delivery, with an elective EP study planned for the postpartum period.

wolff_parkinson_white_syndrome_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening WPW-related Ventricular Fibrillation
  presenting_complaint: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA)
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old male collapsed during a high-intensity football match and was resuscitated from VF. Post-resuscitation ECG showed a clear WPW pattern with a very short pre-excited RR interval during spontaneous AF episodes. He underwent urgent catheter ablation of a high-risk accessory pathway with a short refractory period.

wolff_parkinson_white_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: WPW Syndrome with Iatrogenic Deterioration
  presenting_complaint: Sudden collapse following A&E treatment for palpitations
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female with undiagnosed WPW presented in rapid AF. She was mistakenly administered intravenous verapamil, which blocked the AV node and led to preferential, rapid conduction over the accessory pathway, resulting in VF. She was successfully defibrillated and subsequently underwent ablation of a left-sided pathway.

wolff_parkinson_white_syndrome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent WPW post-Radiofrequency Ablation
  presenting_complaint: Return of palpitations three weeks post-procedure
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male who had undergone seemingly successful ablation of a parahissian pathway presented with recurrent symptoms. Repeat ECG showed the return of the delta wave, suggesting recovery of pathway conduction. A second procedure using cryoablation was performed to minimise the risk of permanent AV block, resulting in successful long-term resolution.

wolff_parkinson_white_syndrome_013:
  primary_diagnosis: WPW Syndrome and Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)
  presenting_complaint: Chest pain and exertional syncope
  summary_of_course: A 17-year-old male with known HCM was found to have a co-existing WPW pattern on ECG. The combination significantly increased his risk for sudden cardiac death due to potential rapid conduction of atrial arrhythmias in a hypertrophied heart. He received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) after accessory pathway ablation failed to eliminate all risk markers.

wolff_parkinson_white_syndrome_014:
  primary_diagnosis: WPW Syndrome mimicking Myocardial Ischemia
  presenting_complaint: Atypical chest pain and ECG abnormalities
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with multiple cardiovascular risk factors presented with chest pain; his ECG showed ST-segment depression and T-wave inversion secondary to abnormal ventricular activation (WPW). High-sensitivity troponins were serial negative, and coronary angiography showed minor non-obstructive disease. The "pseudoischemic" ECG pattern was entirely attributed to the known accessory pathway.

wolff_parkinson_white_syndrome_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Intermittent Wolff-Parkinson-White Pattern
  presenting_complaint: Occasional "skipping" sensation in the chest
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female was referred for an ECG that showed intermittent pre-excitation, where some beats showed a delta wave and others did not. Intermittent pre-excitation at rest typically indicates a low-risk accessory pathway with a long refractory period. She was reassured and opted for conservative management with periodic primary care follow-ups.

wolff_parkinson_white_syndrome_016:
  primary_diagnosis: WPW Syndrome in an Elderly Patient
  presenting_complaint: New onset rapid palpitations and confusion
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old female with no prior cardiac history presented with rapid AF and pre-excitation on ECG. This late presentation of WPW is unusual and was complicated by her underlying hypertension and diastolic dysfunction. She was successfully managed with flecainide and later underwent uneventful pathway ablation.

wolff_parkinson_white_syndrome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: WPW Syndrome with Multiple Accessory Pathways
  presenting_complaint: Refractory SVT despite medical therapy
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male continued to have breakthrough SVT while on bisoprolol and flecainide. Detailed EP mapping identified two separate accessory pathways (one right free wall, one posteroseptal). Ablation of both sites was required to achieve complete resolution of his symptoms and ECG abnormalities.

wolff_parkinson_white_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: WPW Syndrome with Sepsis-Induced Tachycardia
  presenting_complaint: Fever, rigors, and extremely rapid heart rate
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male with known WPW was admitted to the ICU with urosepsis. The physiological stress of sepsis triggered rapid pre-excited AF, which was difficult to rate-control due to the contraindication of AV nodal blockers. He required urgent DC cardioversion and was maintained on an amiodarone infusion until the underlying infection was controlled.

wolff_parkinson_white_syndrome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: WPW Syndrome and ADHD Medication Management
  presenting_complaint: Assessment for starting stimulant medication
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy with ADHD and a known WPW pattern required a cardiology review before starting methylphenidate. Given the potential for stimulants to increase heart rate and trigger arrhythmias, an EP study was performed. The pathway was found to be low-risk, and he was cleared for medication under close specialist monitoring.

wolff_parkinson_white_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Persistent low-grade palpitations and anxiety
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female had been treated for six months for an anxiety disorder before a 24-hour Holter monitor identified paroxysmal SVT. Retrospective review of her baseline ECG showed a subtle delta wave in the lateral leads. Since starting sotalol, her "anxiety" symptoms have completely resolved, and she is awaiting an ablation procedure.
