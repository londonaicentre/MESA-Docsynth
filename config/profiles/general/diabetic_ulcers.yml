  primary_diagnosis: Type 1 DM related neuropathic ulcer
  presenting_complaint: Blister on the dorsal aspect of the foot that won't heal.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female with Type 1 DM and brittle glycaemic control presented with a superficial ulcer caused by tight-fitting shoes. Education on foot care and glycaemic optimisation via insulin pump therapy were initiated. The ulcer healed successfully with local podiatry care and footwear modification.

diabetic_ulcers_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic ulcer complicated by DKA
  presenting_complaint: Vomiting, confusion, and a large infected ulcer on the sole of the foot.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male presented in diabetic ketoacidosis (pH 7.1, ketones 5.2) triggered by a severe foot infection. He was managed with the national DKA protocol alongside IV antibiotics for the ulcer. Once the metabolic crisis resolved, he underwent surgical drainage of a deep plantar abscess.

diabetic_ulcers_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Marjolin's ulcer in a chronic diabetic wound
  presenting_complaint: Exophytic, fungating growth arising from a 10-year-old diabetic ulcer.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with a long-standing, non-healing ulcer on the lateral malleolus presented with a change in the wound's appearance. An incisional biopsy revealed squamous cell carcinoma arising within the chronic wound. He required wide local excision and a skin graft, followed by oncology review.

diabetic_ulcers_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Ischaemic digital ulcer
  presenting_complaint: Small, exquisitely painful ulcer on the tip of the second toe.
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old male with DM and heavy tobacco use presented with a "punched-out" ischaemic ulcer. Angiography showed significant infrapopliteal disease. Following successful tibial artery angioplasty, the pain subsided and the ulcer healed over the subsequent two months.

  presenting_complaint: Rapidly enlarging, painful ulcer with violaceous borders.
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old female with DM and Inflammatory Bowel Disease presented with an atypical ulcer on the pretibial area. Initial debridement led to worsening (pathergy), raising suspicion of Pyoderma Gangrenosum rather than a standard diabetic ulcer. She responded well to systemic corticosteroids and ciclosporin.

diabetic_ulcers_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Infected diabetic ulcer with secondary lymphangitis
  presenting_complaint: Red streaks extending from a foot ulcer up to the groin.
  summary_of_course: A 47-year-old male presented with a Grade 2 infected ulcer and visible lymphangitic streaking. He was febrile with inguinal lymphadenopathy. High-dose IV benzylpenicillin was administered, and the infection was controlled before progressing to systemic sepsis.
