  primary_diagnosis: Cardiac Sarcoidosis
  presenting_complaint: Dyspnoea on exertion and atypical chest pain
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with known pulmonary sarcoidosis presented with new-onset CHB. Cardiac MRI revealed late gadolinium enhancement in the basal septum consistent with sarcoid involvement. He received an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) due to the high risk of ventricular arrhythmias associated with infiltrative cardiomyopathy.

complete_heart_block_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic Nocturnal Complete Heart Block
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding on 24-hour Holter monitor
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old elite rower underwent screening which showed intermittent periods of CHB during sleep, with pauses up to 4 seconds. However, daytime ECGs showed only sinus bradycardia and he remained entirely asymptomatic during high-intensity exercise. Following specialist electrophysiology review, he was managed conservatively with annual follow-up.

complete_heart_block_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic Heart Failure with CHB
  presenting_complaint: Worsening peripheral oedema and orthopnoea
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old male with pre-existing ischaemic cardiomyopathy presented in decompensated heart failure. ECG confirmed CHB which was exacerbating his low cardiac output state. Given his comorbidities and frailty, he was managed with a leadless pacemaker (Micra) to minimise procedural risks, resulting in improved functional status.

complete_heart_block_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Infective Endocarditis with Perivalvular Abscess
  presenting_complaint: Fever, weight loss, and new heart murmur
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male with a history of IVDU presented with Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia. A transoesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) identified an aortic valve vegetation and a root abscess invading the conduction system, manifesting as CHB. He underwent urgent valve replacement and debridement with permanent pacing.

complete_heart_block_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Viral Myocarditis
  presenting_complaint: Flu-like symptoms followed by syncope
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male presented with pleuritic chest pain and elevated Troponin T (1200 ng/L) following a viral prodrome. He acutely developed CHB and was supported with a temporary transvenous pacemaker. Cardiac MRI confirmed myocarditis, and conduction recovered to sinus rhythm after 5 days of supportive care.

complete_heart_block_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Pregnancy-associated Complete Heart Block
  presenting_complaint: Syncope in the third trimester
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old pregnant female (32 weeks gestation) presented after a syncopal event. ECG confirmed CHB with a heart rate of 35 bpm. To ensure maternal stability and fetal perfusion, a permanent pacemaker was implanted using minimal fluoroscopy and abdominal shielding, allowing for a normal vaginal delivery at term.

complete_heart_block_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Cardiac Amyloidosis
  presenting_complaint: Progressive breathlessness and macroglossia
  summary_of_course: A 73-year-old male was investigated for restrictive cardiomyopathy and systemic AL amyloidosis. His clinical course was complicated by the development of complete heart block due to amyloid infiltration of the AV node. Despite PPM implantation, his prognosis remained poor due to advanced multi-organ involvement.
