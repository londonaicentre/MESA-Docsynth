melaena_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Peptic ulcer disease
  presenting_complaint: Black, tarry stools and epigastric pain
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with osteoarthritis taking long-term naproxen presented with a three-day history of melaena and dyspepsia. Blood tests revealed a microcytic anaemia with haemoglobin of 84g/L and urea of 12.4mmol/L. Urgent OGD identified a 2cm Forrest IIb gastric ulcer which was treated with adrenaline injection and heater probe coagulation.

melaena_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Oesophageal varices
  presenting_complaint: Massive melaena and haematemesis
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old female with known alcoholic cirrhosis presented in haemorrhagic shock with profuse melaena and coffee-ground vomit. Following resuscitation with O-negative blood and terlipressin, an emergency OGD under general anaesthesia confirmed Grade III oesophageal varices. Successful variceal band ligation was performed, and the patient was transferred to the ICU for stabilisation.

melaena_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Meckel's diverticulum
  presenting_complaint: Painless melaena in a paediatric patient
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old boy was brought to A&E with a two-day history of passing dark, tarry stools without associated abdominal pain or fever. Initial OGD and colonoscopy were unremarkable, but a Technetium-99m pertechnetate scan (Meckel's scan) showed increased uptake in the distal ileum. The patient underwent laparoscopic resection of a Meckel's diverticulum containing ectopic gastric mucosa, leading to complete resolution of symptoms.

melaena_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Gastric adenocarcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Chronic melaena, weight loss, and anorexia
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male presented to his GP with a six-week history of intermittent melaena and a 10kg unintentional weight loss. Physical examination revealed a palpable Virchow's node in the left supraclavicular fossa. OGD confirmed a large, friable malignant-looking ulcer in the gastric antrum, with biopsies confirming adenocarcinoma, subsequently staged as T3N1M1.

melaena_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Mallory-Weiss tear
  presenting_complaint: Melaena following forceful vomiting
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male presented with melaena 12 hours after a period of heavy binge drinking and repeated retching. He remained haemodynamically stable with a haemoglobin of 135g/L. OGD identified a non-bleeding linear mucosal tear at the gastro-oesophageal junction, which was managed conservatively with proton pump inhibitors and discharge with outpatient follow-up.

melaena_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Dieulafoy lesion
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset massive melaena and syncope
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old female with no prior GI history presented following a syncopal episode and the passage of large volumes of melaena. Initial OGD was challenging due to significant residual blood, but a second look OGD identified a protruding submucosal vessel in the proximal stomach with active spurting. Haemostasis was achieved using endoscopic clips, and the patient required a four-unit red cell transfusion.

melaena_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Pseudomelaena (Iron-induced)
  presenting_complaint: Black stools and constipation
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant female (24 weeks gestation) reported passing black, sticky stools for one week. She was otherwise asymptomatic with a normal haemoglobin and no history of NSAID use. Clinical review confirmed she had recently started high-dose oral ferrous sulphate for iron deficiency of pregnancy, and a faecal occult blood test was negative, confirming pseudomelaena.

melaena_008:
  primary_diagnosis: DOAC-induced gastrointestinal haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Melaena and light-headedness
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female on rivaroxaban for atrial fibrillation presented with melaena and a drop in haemoglobin from 120g/L to 71g/L. The anticoagulant was withheld, and she received a prothrombin complex concentrate. OGD revealed diffuse erosive gastritis, likely exacerbated by concurrent aspirin use, which responded to high-dose intravenous omeprazole.

melaena_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Small bowel angiodysplasia
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent subacute melaena
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old male with aortic stenosis presented with recurrent episodes of mild melaena and iron deficiency anaemia (Heyde's syndrome). Both OGD and colonoscopy failed to identify a bleeding source. Video capsule endoscopy subsequently identified multiple angiodysplastic lesions in the mid-jejunum, which were later treated via double-balloon enteroscopy and argon plasma coagulation.

melaena_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-ERCP haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Melaena 24 hours post-procedure
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male underwent an ERCP and sphincterotomy for choledocholithiasis. The following day, he developed melaena and a tachycardia of 110 bpm. Urgent repeat endoscopy showed active oozing from the sphincterotomy site, which was successfully controlled with the application of a haemostatic powder (Haemospray).

melaena_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic melaena and transfusion dependence
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female with systemic sclerosis presented with persistent melaena and symptomatic anaemia requiring monthly transfusions. OGD showed characteristic longitudinal erythematous strips in the antrum (watermelon stomach). She underwent multiple sessions of argon plasma coagulation (APC), which significantly reduced her transfusion requirements and stabilised her haemoglobin levels.

melaena_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Swallowed maternal blood
  presenting_complaint: Melaena in a 2-day-old neonate
  summary_of_course: A healthy 2-day-old neonate born via vaginal delivery was noted to have black, tarry stools in his nappy. The infant was breastfed and clinically well with a soft abdomen and normal vitals. An Apt test (alkali denaturation test) performed on the stool sample confirmed the presence of maternal haemoglobin, indicating swallowed blood during delivery rather than neonatal GI bleeding.

melaena_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Aspirin-induced erosive gastritis
  presenting_complaint: Mild melaena and epigastric discomfort
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female started taking 75mg aspirin daily for primary prevention without medical advice and subsequently developed mild melaena. Her haemoglobin was 108g/L with a slightly raised urea. OGD demonstrated multiple small, superficial erosions throughout the gastric body with no evidence of malignancy, and symptoms resolved upon cessation of aspirin and a short course of PPI.

melaena_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Aorto-enteric fistula
  presenting_complaint: Herald melaena followed by catastrophic haemorrhage
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male with a history of an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair five years prior presented with a "herald" episode of melaena. While in the emergency department, he developed sudden, massive haematemesis and profound hypotension. An urgent CT angiogram confirmed an aorto-enteric fistula between the graft and the third part of the duodenum; he was rushed to theatre for emergency vascular repair but unfortunately died intraoperatively.

melaena_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Re-bleeding duodenal ulcer
  presenting_complaint: Recurrence of melaena after endoscopic therapy
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male was admitted with melaena from a posterior duodenal ulcer, which was initially treated with clips. On day three of admission, he had a further large volume of melaena and a drop in blood pressure. Repeat OGD showed the clips had displaced; haemostasis was re-achieved with a combination of adrenaline injection and thermal probe, and he was commenced on a high-dose PPI infusion.

melaena_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Small bowel Crohn's disease
  presenting_complaint: Melaena, right iliac fossa pain, and fever
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female presented with a one-week history of dark stools, crampy abdominal pain, and low-grade fever. Investigations showed raised faecal calprotectin (1200µg/g) and anaemia. MRE (Magnetic Resonance Enterography) and balloon enteroscopy revealed deep ulceration in the terminal ileum consistent with Crohn's disease, which was the source of the melaena.

melaena_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Zollinger-Ellison syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Refractory melaena and severe diarrhoea
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male presented with recurrent melaena despite previous successful endoscopic treatments for multiple peptic ulcers. He also reported chronic steatorrhoea and weight loss. Fasting gastrin levels were found to be markedly elevated (>1000 pg/mL), and a somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (OctreoScan) identified a small gastrinoma in the pancreas.

melaena_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Grade D Oesophagitis
  presenting_complaint: Mild melaena and severe heartburn
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female with long-standing GORD and hiatus hernia presented with a two-day history of melaena. She had stopped her PPI medication one month prior. OGD revealed circumferential ulceration of the distal oesophageal mucosa (Los Angeles Grade D oesophagitis) with evidence of recent slow oozing but no visible vessel, necessitating the resumption of high-dose PPI therapy.

melaena_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Portal hypertensive gastropathy
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent melaena and lethargy
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with known compensated cirrhosis presented to the outpatient clinic with chronic lethargy and intermittent melaena. Bloods showed a persistent iron deficiency anaemia. OGD demonstrated a diffuse "snake-skin" mosaic pattern of the gastric mucosa consistent with portal hypertensive gastropathy; he was started on propranolol to reduce portal pressures, which successfully reduced the frequency of bleeding.

melaena_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Gastric Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumour (GIST)
  presenting_complaint: Melaena and a palpable epigastric mass
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female presented with a one-week history of melaena and vague upper abdominal fullness. Examination revealed a firm, non-tender mass in the epigastrium. OGD and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) identified a large subepithelial lesion with central ulceration (umbilication) in the gastric body; histopathology following surgical resection confirmed a GIST with low mitotic index.
