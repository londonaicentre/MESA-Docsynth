infectious_mononucleosis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute infectious mononucleosis
  presenting_complaint: Sore throat, high fever, and swollen neck glands for 5 days.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old university student presented with severe exudative tonsillitis and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. A positive Monospot test and presence of atypical lymphocytes on blood film confirmed the diagnosis. Managed with simple analgesia and rest, symptoms resolved over three weeks without complications.

infectious_mononucleosis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric infectious mononucleosis
  presenting_complaint: Mild fever, runny nose, and abdominal discomfort.
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old male presented with non-specific viral symptoms and mild hepatomegaly. Initial suspicion was a common cold, but persistent lethargy led to EBV serology showing positive VCA IgM. The child recovered fully within ten days with supportive care at home.

infectious_mononucleosis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Infectious mononucleosis with amoxicillin-induced rash
  presenting_complaint: Widespread maculopapular rash following treatment for suspected strep throat.
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old female was initially prescribed amoxicillin for pharyngitis by her GP. Three days later, she developed a pruritic, copper-coloured rash across her trunk and limbs. EBV serology confirmed glandular fever, and the rash was identified as a classic drug-induced eruption associated with the virus.

infectious_mononucleosis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Spontaneous splenic rupture secondary to EBV
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset severe left upper quadrant (LUQ) pain and lightheadedness.
  summary_of_course: A 17-year-old male athlete with a 1-week history of glandular fever symptoms presented in hypovolaemic shock. An urgent CT abdomen revealed a ruptured spleen with significant haemoperitoneum. He underwent an emergency splenectomy and was subsequently counselled on the long-term risks of asplenia.

infectious_mononucleosis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Infectious mononucleosis with upper airway obstruction
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty breathing, "hot potato" voice, and inability to swallow saliva.
  summary_of_course: An 18-year-old male was admitted with "kissing tonsils" and significant pharyngeal oedema. Due to impending airway compromise, he was treated with intravenous dexamethasone and humidified oxygen. His airway stabilised within 24 hours, avoiding the need for intubation.

infectious_mononucleosis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Atypical infectious mononucleosis in the elderly
  presenting_complaint: Persistent fever, jaundice, and profound malaise.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male presented with a fever of unknown origin and deranged liver function tests (ALT 450 U/L, Bilirubin 50 µmol/L) but no sore throat. Extensive malignancy screening was negative, but EBV PCR was strongly positive. He required a prolonged recovery period due to significant post-viral fatigue.

infectious_mononucleosis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: EBV-associated Guillain-Barré Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Ascending weakness and tingling in the feet following a flu-like illness.
  summary_of_course: A 20-year-old female developed progressive lower limb weakness two weeks after a diagnosed episode of infectious mononucleosis. Nerve conduction studies and CSF analysis (protein-cytological dissociation) confirmed Guillain-Barré Syndrome. She was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and required intensive physiotherapy.

infectious_mononucleosis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) complicating EBV
  presenting_complaint: Increasing shortness of breath, pallor, and dark urine.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male with active glandular fever developed symptomatic anaemia (Hb 72 g/L). Investigations showed a positive direct antiglobulin test (Coombs test) and raised reticulocytes, consistent with cold-agglutinin AIHA. He was managed with a cautious course of prednisolone and blood transfusions.

infectious_mononucleosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-viral fatigue syndrome secondary to EBV
  presenting_complaint: Disabling exhaustion and "brain fog" lasting six months.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old female reported inability to return to work following a laboratory-confirmed EBV infection. Despite normal inflammatory markers and thyroid function, her fatigue remained profound and exertional. She was referred to a specialist CFS/ME service for pacing strategies and psychological support.

infectious_mononucleosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute EBV hepatitis
  presenting_complaint: Yellowing of the eyes, dark urine, and right upper quadrant pain.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male presented with clinical jaundice and hepatomegaly. Laboratory results showed significantly elevated transaminases (ALT 850 U/L) and positive EBV VCA IgM, with negative hepatitis A, B, and C screens. The hepatitis was self-limiting, with LFTs returning to baseline over six weeks.

infectious_mononucleosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe infectious mononucleosis in an immunocompromised host
  presenting_complaint: Prolonged high fevers, night sweats, and weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female with poorly controlled HIV presented with a severe, protracted course of EBV. Due to high viral loads and the risk of B-cell lymphoma, she was monitored closely with serial EBV DNA PCR. Her symptoms eventually improved following the optimisation of her antiretroviral therapy (ART).

infectious_mononucleosis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Heterophile-negative infectious mononucleosis
  presenting_complaint: Classic triad of fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy.
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old female twice tested negative on the Monospot test during the first week of illness. Because clinical suspicion remained high, EBV-specific serology (VCA IgM and EA) was performed, which confirmed acute infection. This case highlights the low sensitivity of heterophile antibody tests in early presentation and younger patients.

infectious_mononucleosis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: EBV-induced myocarditis
  presenting_complaint: Sharp chest pain and palpitations two weeks after a sore throat.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male presented to A&E with pleuritic chest pain and an elevated Troponin T (400 ng/L). ECG showed diffuse ST-elevation, and cardiac MRI confirmed patchy late gadolinium enhancement consistent with myocarditis. EBV serology was positive for recent infection, and he was managed with heart failure medications and rest.

infectious_mononucleosis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Infectious mononucleosis with Hoagland sign
  presenting_complaint: Severe eyelid swelling and difficulty opening eyes.
  summary_of_course: An 18-year-old male presented with bilateral periorbital oedema (Hoagland sign) preceding the onset of exudative pharyngitis. Initial concerns for orbital cellulitis were ruled out by a normal CT orbit. The diagnosis of EBV was confirmed via Monospot, and the oedema resolved spontaneously as the systemic symptoms progressed.

infectious_mononucleosis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Concurrent EBV and Group A Streptococcal pharyngitis
  presenting_complaint: Agonising sore throat and inability to swallow fluids.
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old female had a positive throat swab for Streptococcus pyogenes and a positive Monospot test. She was treated with oral Penicillin V (avoiding amoxicillin) for the bacterial component and IV fluids for dehydration. This dual infection resulted in a more severe and prolonged clinical course than typical mono.

infectious_mononucleosis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: EBV-associated immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)
  presenting_complaint: Unexplained bruising and a petechial rash on the lower legs.
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old male with mild glandular fever symptoms was found to have a profound thrombocytopenia (platelets 12 x 10^9/L). Bone marrow biopsy was unnecessary as EBV serology was positive and no other cell lines were affected. He responded well to a short course of oral corticosteroids with platelet recovery within two weeks.

infectious_mononucleosis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Infectious mononucleosis in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Low-grade fever and persistent tiredness at 24 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 23-year-old pregnant female presented with subacute malaise. EBV serology confirmed primary infection; however, as EBV is not known to be teratogenic, the patient was reassured. She was monitored for splenic enlargement and dehydration but completed a full-term pregnancy without foetal complications.

infectious_mononucleosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Mesenteric lymphadenitis secondary to EBV
  presenting_complaint: Right lower quadrant abdominal pain mimicking appendicitis.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male was referred to the surgical team with suspected appendicitis. Ultrasound showed significant mesenteric lymphadenopathy and a normal appendix, alongside splenomegaly. Subsequent bloods showed lymphocytosis and a positive Monospot, confirming EBV as the cause of the abdominal pain.

infectious_mononucleosis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe pharyngitis with dehydration
  presenting_complaint: Inability to tolerate oral intake due to throat pain.
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old female was admitted to the medical ward for intravenous rehydration and pain management. Her tonsils were covered in thick white exudate, and she had significant trismus. She was treated with IV lidocaine gargles, paracetamol, and fluids, and was discharged after 48 hours once oral intake was established.

infectious_mononucleosis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: EBV encephalitis
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, headache, and a new-onset generalised seizure.
  summary_of_course: A 20-year-old male presented with acute encephalopathy following a week of malaise. Lumbar puncture revealed a lymphocytic pleocytosis, and CSF PCR was positive for EBV DNA. He was treated with supportive care in the ICU; although he survived, he required long-term follow-up for cognitive deficits and epilepsy management.
