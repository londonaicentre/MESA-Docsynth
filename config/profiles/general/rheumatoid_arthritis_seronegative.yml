Her symptoms stabilised, and she was monitored closely by the obstetric-rheumatology joint clinic.

rheumatoid_arthritis_seronegative_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Seronegative rheumatoid arthritis (RS3PE variant)
  presenting_complaint: Symmetrical hand swelling with pitting oedema on the dorsum.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male presented with "remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting oedema" (RS3PE) involving both hands. Although RF and CCP were negative, the severity of the underlying synovitis led to a formal diagnosis of seronegative RA. He showed a dramatic response to a moderate course of prednisolone and was maintained on methotrexate.

rheumatoid_arthritis_seronegative_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild seronegative rheumatoid arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Occasional stiffness and swelling in the knuckles.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old woman presented with intermittent symptoms that did not initially meet ACR/EULAR criteria. Over 18 months, the symptoms progressed to persistent symmetrical synovitis of the MCPs with a raised ESR of 35 mm/hr.
