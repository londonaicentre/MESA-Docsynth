urinary_incontinence_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Stress urinary incontinence
  presenting_complaint: Involuntary leakage of urine when coughing or sneezing.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female, six months postpartum following a prolonged second stage of labour, reports mild leakage during high-impact exercise and sneezing. Physical examination confirmed a mild cystocele but normal neurological status. She was referred to pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with a specialist physiotherapist, resulting in significant symptomatic improvement after 12 weeks.

urinary_incontinence_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Urge urinary incontinence
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, intense urge to void followed by immediate large-volume leakage.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female with a history of hypertension presented with severe urgency and frequency, waking four times per night. Bladder diary showed frequent small-volume voids and multiple episodes of urge-related leakage. After failing lifestyle modifications and bladder retraining, she was commenced on Mirabegron 50mg daily, which reduced leakage episodes by 70%.

urinary_incontinence_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Overflow incontinence secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia
  presenting_complaint: Constant dribbling of urine and a sensation of incomplete emptying.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presented with a distended, non-tender bladder and continuous urinary dribbling. Bedside ultrasound revealed a post-void residual (PVR) volume of 850ml and bilateral hydronephrosis on formal imaging. He underwent emergency catheterisation and was later scheduled for a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) once renal function stabilised.

urinary_incontinence_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Neurogenic bladder with reflex incontinence
  presenting_complaint: Frequent, unpredictable voiding without warning.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male with a T10 spinal cord injury (complete) presented for review of his bladder management. Urodynamic studies demonstrated detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia and high-pressure detrusor overactivity. He was managed with a combination of anticholinergics and clean intermittent self-catheterisation (CISC) to protect the upper urinary tract and maintain social continence.

urinary_incontinence_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Functional incontinence
  presenting_complaint: Inability to reach the toilet in time due to mobility issues.
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old female with advanced Alzheimer's dementia and severe osteoarthritis was admitted from a care home following a fall. While her bladder function was physiologically intact, her cognitive impairment and slow gait prevented timely access to the bathroom. Management focused on a scheduled toileting regimen and environmental modifications, which reduced the frequency of soiled garments.

urinary_incontinence_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Mixed urinary incontinence
  presenting_complaint: Leakage associated with both urgency and physical exertion.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old woman with a BMI of 38 presented with moderate leakage during aerobics and frequent rushing to the toilet. Urodynamics confirmed both urodynamic stress incontinence and detrusor overactivity. Treatment involved a dual approach of supervised weight loss, PFMT, and a trial of Solifenacin, resulting in moderate improvement of the urge component.

urinary_incontinence_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary nocturnal enuresis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent bedwetting at age seven.
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old boy was brought to the paediatric clinic for bedwetting five nights per week. There were no daytime symptoms or history of constipation. After failing an enuresis alarm trial, he was prescribed Desmopressin (Desmotabs) for use during school trips, which provided short-term dryness and improved his confidence.

urinary_incontinence_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-prostatectomy stress incontinence
  presenting_complaint: Severe, continuous leakage following robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP).
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male underwent RALP for prostate cancer and experienced persistent, high-volume stress incontinence requiring four pads per day at 12 months post-op. Despite intensive PFMT, symptoms remained refractory. He was successfully treated with the surgical implantation of an artificial urinary sphincter (AUS), achieving near-total dryness.

urinary_incontinence_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Vesicovaginal fistula
  presenting_complaint: Constant, watery vaginal discharge and total loss of urinary control.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female presented three weeks after a difficult total abdominal hysterectomy with continuous leakage of fluid from the vagina. A methylene blue test and subsequent cystoscopy confirmed a 5mm fistula between the bladder trigone and the vaginal vault. She underwent a successful transvaginal fistula repair with a Martius flap interposition.

urinary_incontinence_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Cauda equina syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Acute urinary incontinence, lower back pain, and "saddle" numbness.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented to A&E with acute-onset urinary incontinence and bilateral sciatica. Clinical examination revealed reduced anal tone and perianal anaesthesia. Emergency MRI confirmed a large L4/L5 disc prolapse compressing the cauda equina; he was rushed for emergency surgical decompression within 6 hours to prevent permanent neurological deficit.

urinary_incontinence_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Drug-induced urinary incontinence
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of urinary frequency and leakage after starting new medications.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female with congestive heart failure was recently started on high-dose Furosemide and Amlodipine. She reported new-onset urge incontinence that made her housebound. A medication review resulted in timing the diuretic for earlier in the day and adjusting the calcium channel blocker, which significantly reduced the urgency episodes.

urinary_incontinence_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute urinary incontinence secondary to Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)
  presenting_complaint: New-onset confusion and urinary incontinence in an elderly patient.
  summary_of_course: An 84-year-old male with mild cognitive impairment was brought to the hospital with acute delirium and new urinary incontinence. Urinalysis was positive for nitrites and leucocytes, and urine culture grew E. coli. Following a course of Nitrofurantoin and intravenous fluids, his mental state returned to baseline and the incontinence resolved completely.

urinary_incontinence_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Intrinsic sphincter deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Severe leakage with minimal movement, such as standing up.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female with multiple previous pelvic surgeries presented with "drainpipe urethra" on imaging and severe stress incontinence. Urodynamics showed a very low abdominal leak point pressure. She was treated with urethral bulking agent injections (Bulkamid), which provided a 50% reduction in pad usage and improved her quality of life.

urinary_incontinence_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Detrusor hyperreflexia secondary to Multiple Sclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, uncontrollable bladder emptying.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old woman with relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis reported worsening bladder control. Urodynamic testing showed neurogenic detrusor overactivity with high voiding pressures. She was started on Baclofen for spasticity and Oxybutynin for the bladder, eventually requiring intra-detrusor Botulinum toxin A injections to achieve continence.

urinary_incontinence_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic cystopathy with overflow incontinence
  presenting_complaint: Poor urinary stream and frequent small-volume leakage at night.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with a 30-year history of poorly controlled Type 1 Diabetes presented with chronic urinary retention and overflow. Cystometrogram showed a large-capacity, acontractile bladder (atonic bladder). He was taught CISC twice daily to reduce residual volumes and prevent recurrent infections, which resolved the nocturnal dribbling.

urinary_incontinence_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Ectopic ureter
  presenting_complaint: Constant dampness in a child who is otherwise toilet trained.
  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old girl presented with a history of being "never dry," despite normal voiding patterns. Physical examination and ultrasound were initially normal, but an MRI urogram identified a duplex kidney with an ectopic ureter draining into the vestibule. She underwent a partial nephrectomy of the upper pole, which resulted in immediate and total continence.

urinary_incontinence_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory overactive bladder
  presenting_complaint: Persistent urge incontinence despite multiple pharmacological trials.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female had failed treatment with three different antimuscarinics and Mirabegron due to side effects and lack of efficacy. She underwent a trial of Sacral Neuromodulation (SNM), which resulted in a 90% reduction in symptoms. A permanent InterStim device was subsequently implanted with excellent long-term results.

urinary_incontinence_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Radiation cystitis with urge incontinence
  presenting_complaint: Frequency, urgency, and haematuria following pelvic radiotherapy.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male, three years post-radiotherapy for prostate cancer, presented with severe urge incontinence and intermittent macroscopic haematuria. Cystoscopy showed telangiectasia and a friable bladder mucosa. He was treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy and low-dose anticholinergics, which helped stabilise the bladder wall and reduce the frequency of urgency episodes.

urinary_incontinence_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Overflow incontinence secondary to faecal impaction
  presenting_complaint: New-onset urinary dribbling and abdominal discomfort.
  summary_of_course: A 92-year-old bedbound female in a nursing home developed urinary incontinence over 48 hours. Abdominal palpation revealed a hard mass in the left iliac fossa, and rectal examination confirmed severe faecal impaction. Following the administration of enemas and manual disimpaction, the urinary overflow resolved, as the mechanical pressure on the bladder neck was relieved.

urinary_incontinence_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Athletic stress urinary incontinence
  presenting_complaint: Leakage only during heavy weightlifting and jumping.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old nulliparous CrossFit athlete reported embarrassing leakage during "double-unders" and heavy squats. She had no symptoms during daily activities. Assessment showed high pelvic floor tone but poor coordination during Valsalva. She was managed with "the Knack" technique (pre-contraction of pelvic floor) and a supportive intravaginal pessary for use during training, allowing her to continue her sport dry.
