acute_limb_ischaemia_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute embolic limb ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of excruciating left leg pain and numbness
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old female with known atrial fibrillation, non-compliant with apixaban, presented with a 2-hour history of a cold, pale left leg. Physical examination revealed absent distal pulses and sensory loss in the foot (Rutherford IIb). Emergency femoral embolectomy was performed under local anaesthetic, successfully retrieving organised thrombus and restoring triphasic flow.

acute_limb_ischaemia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic limb ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Worsening right foot pain over 48 hours, now present at rest
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male smoker with long-standing intermittent claudication presented with subacute deterioration. CT angiogram showed multi-level atherosclerotic disease with acute thrombosis of the superficial femoral artery. He underwent catheter-directed thrombolysis (Alteplase) for 24 hours followed by an elective femoropopliteal bypass to address the underlying stenosis.

acute_limb_ischaemia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Traumatic popliteal artery occlusion
  presenting_complaint: Severe right knee pain and inability to move toes following a road traffic accident
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male sustained a posterior knee dislocation during a high-velocity collision. Despite successful joint reduction, the foot remained perishingly cold with no doppler signals (Rutherford III). Urgent surgical exploration revealed a popliteal artery intimal tear and thrombosis, requiring a reversed vein graft and four-compartment fasciotomies to manage reperfusion injury.

acute_limb_ischaemia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic femoral artery dissection
  presenting_complaint: Cold, painful right leg immediately following cardiac catheterisation
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male underwent percutaneous coronary intervention via the right common femoral artery. Post-procedure, he developed a large groin haematoma and sudden-onset leg ischaemia. Duplex ultrasound confirmed an iatrogenic dissection obstructing flow, necessitating emergency surgical repair of the femoral artery and evacuation of the haematoma.

acute_limb_ischaemia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Neonatal acute limb ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Blue discolouration of the left foot and toes
  summary_of_course: A 2-day-old neonate in the NICU with an umbilical artery catheter (UAC) in situ developed sudden cyanosis of the left lower limb. The UAC was immediately removed, and the infant was started on a low-dose heparin infusion. Spontaneous reperfusion occurred within 6 hours without the need for surgical intervention, and the limb remained viable.

acute_limb_ischaemia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute limb ischaemia secondary to aortic dissection
  presenting_complaint: Sudden tearing back pain followed by numbness in the right leg
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male presented with symptoms of a Stanford Type B aortic dissection. Over the next hour, he developed signs of malperfusion to the right leg with loss of femoral pulses. An emergency endovascular fenestration and stenting of the aortic true lumen were performed to restore perfusion to the iliac vessels, preventing limb loss.

acute_limb_ischaemia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Thrombosed popliteal artery aneurysm
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of coldness and "pins and needles" in the right foot
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with a known but unmonitored right popliteal aneurysm presented with acute Rutherford IIa ischaemia. Urgent CT angiography showed complete thrombosis of the 4cm aneurysm with poor distal runoff. He underwent an emergency posterior-approach aneurysm ligation and bypass with an interposition vein graft, resulting in full clinical recovery.

acute_limb_ischaemia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Phlegmasia cerulea dolens
  presenting_complaint: Massive swelling and purple discolouration of the left leg
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer presented with sudden-onset, massive left leg oedema and intense cyanosis. Clinical diagnosis of phlegmasia cerulea dolens was made, indicating limb-threatening venous ischaemia. She was treated with urgent catheter-directed venous thrombolysis and systemic anticoagulation, which resolved the venous outflow obstruction and restored arterial perfusion.

acute_limb_ischaemia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES)
  presenting_complaint: Acute calf pain and cold foot after a sprint during a rugby match
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old athletic male presented with acute ischaemic symptoms after intense exercise. Investigations revealed an anatomical variant where the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle compressed the popliteal artery, leading to acute thrombosis. He required surgical decompression of the muscle and a short segment vein bypass to salvage the limb.

acute_limb_ischaemia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Irreversible limb ischaemia (Rutherford III)
  presenting_complaint: Fixed mottling and paralysis of the left leg for 24 hours
  summary_of_course: A 92-year-old resident of a nursing home with advanced dementia was found with an unresponsive, cold, and rigid left leg. Examination confirmed fixed skin mottling and absence of muscle function, indicating irreversible tissue death. After discussion with the family regarding her comorbidities and quality of life, the decision was made for end-of-life care and conservative management.

acute_limb_ischaemia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Paradoxical embolism
  presenting_complaint: Sudden right-hand pain and pallor in a post-partum patient
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female, 10 days post-caesarean section, presented with acute ischaemia of the right arm. Simultaneously, she was diagnosed with a deep vein thrombosis and a small pulmonary embolism. A patent foramen ovale (PFO) was identified on echocardiography, confirming a paradoxical arterial embolus; she was successfully treated with a brachial embolectomy and long-term anticoagulation.

acute_limb_ischaemia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute limb ischaemia secondary to IV drug use
  presenting_complaint: Severe groin pain and cold right leg after an attempted injection
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use presented after accidentally injecting a crushed tablet into his right femoral artery. He developed immediate vasospasm and microvascular thrombosis. Despite aggressive treatment with intra-arterial vasodilators (Iloprost) and heparin, he progressed to digital gangrene requiring subsequent minor amputations.

acute_limb_ischaemia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute upper limb ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of coldness and weakness in the left hand
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension presented with a pale, pulseless left arm distal to the elbow. Duplex imaging identified an embolus at the brachial artery bifurcation, likely originating from an atherosclerotic plaque in the subclavian artery. He underwent successful surgical embolectomy via a transverse arteriotomy, restoring full function to the hand.

acute_limb_ischaemia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic limb ischaemia (Rutherford IIa)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden reduction in walking distance followed by rest pain at night
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with a known history of peripheral arterial disease reported a "sudden dip" in her mobility two weeks prior. Clinical examination revealed a cool foot with delayed capillary refill but preserved motor function. Digital subtraction angiography showed a subacute occlusion of the superficial femoral artery, which was treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting.

acute_limb_ischaemia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Reperfusion injury and compartment syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Severe calf pain and swelling following successful embolectomy
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male underwent successful late embolectomy (8 hours post-onset) for acute limb ischaemia. Two hours post-operatively, he developed tense calf swelling, pain out of proportion to clinical findings, and metabolic acidosis with hyperkalaemia. Diagnosis of compartment syndrome was made, and emergency fasciotomies were performed; he required temporary haemofiltration for acute kidney injury.

acute_limb_ischaemia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic "silent" acute limb ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: New dark discolouration of the toes without significant pain
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes and profound peripheral neuropathy presented with a blackening great toe. Because of his neuropathy, he did not experience the typical pain of acute ischaemia, leading to a delayed presentation. Angiography showed total occlusion of the infrapopliteal vessels with no reconstructive options, ultimately requiring a below-knee amputation.

acute_limb_ischaemia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease)
  presenting_complaint: Acute, painful ulceration of the fingertips and toes
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old heavy smoker presented with acute digital ischaemia in multiple limbs. Extensive autoimmune and embolic workups were negative, but angiography showed characteristic "corkscrew" collaterals and distal small-vessel occlusions. He was diagnosed with Buerger's disease and managed with strict smoking cessation and intravenous prostanoids, which led to a gradual improvement in perfusion.

acute_limb_ischaemia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Blue toe syndrome (Cholesterol embolisation)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, painful purple spots on the soles of both feet
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male presented one week after an endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) with "blue toes" despite palpable pedal pulses. This was diagnosed as micro-embolisation of cholesterol crystals from the aortic wall during the procedure. Management was conservative, focusing on high-dose statins and antiplatelet therapy, with slow resolution of the ischaemic lesions.

acute_limb_ischaemia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Vasopressor-induced peripheral ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Symmetrical cyanosis of all four limbs in an ICU patient
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male in septic shock required high-dose noradrenaline infusions for haemodynamic stability. On day three, he developed symmetrical peripheral cyanosis and coldness in his hands and feet. As the sepsis improved and vasopressors were weaned, the ischaemia partially reversed, although he suffered limited dry gangrene of the distal phalanges of the toes.

acute_limb_ischaemia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Failed thrombolysis in acute limb ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Persistent leg pain and new-onset foot drop during thrombolytic therapy
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old female with an occluded popliteal segment underwent catheter-directed thrombolysis. After 12 hours, her symptoms worsened, and she developed paralysis of the hallux (progression to Rutherford IIb). Repeat angiography showed no clot lysis and proximal propagation of the thrombus; she was converted to emergency surgery, but poor distal runoff necessitated an above-knee amputation.
