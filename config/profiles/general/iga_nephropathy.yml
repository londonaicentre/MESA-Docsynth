iga_nephropathy_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Classic synpharyngitic IgA nephropathy
  presenting_complaint: Macroscopic haematuria following upper respiratory tract infection
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy presented with "cola-coloured" urine 24 hours after developing a sore throat and fever. Physical examination was unremarkable with a blood pressure of 105/65 mmHg and no peripheral oedema. Urinalysis confirmed macroscopic haematuria and 1+ proteinuria, while serum creatinine and C3/C4 levels were normal. The haematuria resolved spontaneously within 4 days, and he is being monitored in the paediatric outpatient clinic with a diagnosis of mild IgAN.

iga_nephropathy_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic IgA nephropathy with persistent proteinuria
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of proteinuria and hypertension at a routine health check
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old man was referred after a workplace medical revealed a blood pressure of 155/95 mmHg and 2+ proteinuria. Investigations showed a uPCR of 120 mg/mmol and an eGFR of 72 mL/min/1.73m2. Renal biopsy demonstrated IgA deposition with moderate mesangial hypercellularity (M1, E0, S0, T0). He was commenced on Ramipril 10mg daily and Dapagliflozin 10mg, resulting in a reduction of proteinuria to 45 mg/mmol over six months.

iga_nephropathy_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Rapidly progressive IgA nephropathy (Crescentic IgAN)
  presenting_complaint: Acute kidney injury with oliguria and malaise
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old woman presented with a two-week history of worsening lethargy, nausea, and reduced urine output. Admission bloods revealed a serum creatinine of 480 µmol/L (baseline 80) and a uPCR of 350 mg/mmol. Urgent renal biopsy showed IgA nephropathy with cellular crescents in 60% of glomeruli. She was treated with pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisolone and Cyclophosphamide, resulting in partial recovery of renal function to an eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73m2.

iga_nephropathy_004:
  primary_diagnosis: IgA nephropathy with Nephrotic Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Severe bilateral lower limb oedema and frothy urine
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male university student presented with rapid-onset ankle swelling and periorbital puffiness. Laboratory tests showed a serum albumin of 22 g/L, total cholesterol of 8.2 mmol/L, and 24-hour urinary protein of 7.5g. Biopsy confirmed IgA nephropathy with extensive podocyte foot process effacement on electron microscopy, suggesting a minimal change-like variant. He responded rapidly to high-dose oral corticosteroids with complete resolution of proteinuria within four weeks.

iga_nephropathy_005:
  primary_diagnosis: IgA Vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein Purpura) with nephritis
  presenting_complaint: Purpuric rash, arthralgia, and abdominal pain
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old girl presented with a palpable purpuric rash on her buttocks and lower limbs, accompanied by colicky abdominal pain and swollen ankles. Urinalysis showed microscopic haematuria and a uPCR of 180 mg/mmol. Clinical diagnosis of IgA vasculitis was made, and due to persistent nephritic-range proteinuria, she was started on a tapering course of prednisolone. Her systemic symptoms resolved, but she remains under long-term follow-up for persistent microscopic haematuria.

iga_nephropathy_006:
  primary_diagnosis: IgA nephropathy in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Worsening hypertension and proteinuria in the second trimester
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old pregnant woman (G1P0) with known IgA nephropathy presented at 24 weeks gestation with a BP of 160/105 mmHg and a rise in uPCR from 40 to 220 mg/mmol. Distinguishing between an IgAN flare and pre-eclampsia proved challenging; however, stable serum urate and lack of liver enzyme elevation favoured a flare. She was managed with Labetalol and Nifedipine, and a healthy infant was delivered via caesarean section at 32 weeks due to progressive foetal growth restriction.

iga_nephropathy_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease secondary to IgAN
  presenting_complaint: Pruritus, fatigue, and metallic taste in mouth
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with a 20-year history of biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy presented with symptoms of uraemia. His eGFR had declined steadily from 45 to 12 mL/min/1.73m2 over the last three years despite optimal blood pressure control with Losartan. Ultrasound showed small, echogenic kidneys bilaterally (8.5 cm). He has been counselled regarding renal replacement therapy and is currently undergoing workup for arteriovenous fistula formation.

iga_nephropathy_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent IgA nephropathy post-renal transplant
  presenting_complaint: New onset microscopic haematuria five years post-transplant
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male who underwent a deceased donor renal transplant for IgAN-related ESRD five years ago presented with a rising creatinine (130 to 175 µmol/L). A protocol graft biopsy revealed de novo mesangial IgA deposits and endocapillary hypercellularity. Immunosuppression was optimised by increasing his Mycophenolate Mofetil dose and adding an ACE inhibitor. His graft function has since stabilised, though low-grade proteinuria persists.

iga_nephropathy_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary IgA nephropathy associated with Liver Cirrhosis
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic microscopic haematuria found during transplant workup
  summary_of_course: A 56-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis and portal hypertension was found to have persistent microscopic haematuria and a uPCR of 60 mg/mmol. Renal biopsy was performed prior to listing for a liver transplant, showing diffuse mesangial IgA deposits without significant inflammatory changes. This was attributed to impaired hepatic clearance of IgA complexes. No specific renal treatment was initiated other than monitoring, as his renal function remained stable.

iga_nephropathy_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Kidney Injury due to Gross Haematuria-induced ATN
  presenting_complaint: Severe visible haematuria and acute oliguria
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female with known mild IgAN experienced a severe episode of macroscopic haematuria during a flu-like illness. Her creatinine rose sharply from 75 to 210 µmol/L within 48 hours. A repeat biopsy showed no crescents but revealed extensive red blood cell casts obstructing the tubules and associated acute tubular necrosis (ATN). She was managed with aggressive intravenous hydration, and her renal function returned to baseline as the haematuria subsided.

iga_nephropathy_011:
  primary_diagnosis: IgA nephropathy with comorbid Type 2 Diabetes
  presenting_complaint: Progressive decline in renal function despite glycaemic control
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with a 10-year history of Type 2 Diabetes presented with a uPCR of 150 mg/mmol and an eGFR of 45 mL/min/1.73m2. While diabetic nephropathy was suspected, a renal biopsy was performed due to the presence of persistent microscopic haematuria. Biopsy revealed a dual pathology of Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules and mesangial IgA deposits. Management was intensified with the addition of an SGLT2 inhibitor and Finerenone to target both disease processes.

iga_nephropathy_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory IgA nephropathy
  presenting_complaint: Persistent high-grade proteinuria despite triple therapy
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male with IgAN (M1, E1, S1, T0) remained heavily proteinuric (uPCR 280 mg/mmol) despite maximal doses of Ramipril, Dapagliflozin, and a six-month course of oral Prednisolone. He was subsequently enrolled in a clinical trial for a targeted-release formulation of Budesonide. Following 9 months of treatment, his uPCR reduced by 45%, and his eGFR slope stabilised, suggesting a positive response to gut-targeted mucosal immunotherapy.

iga_nephropathy_013:
  primary_diagnosis: IgA nephropathy presenting as Malignant Hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Severe headache, blurred vision, and BP 220/130 mmHg
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department with a hypertensive emergency and Grade IV hypertensive retinopathy. Initial bloods showed a creatinine of 190 µmol/L and urinalysis showed 3+ blood and 3+ protein. Once her blood pressure was safely controlled with intravenous Labetalol, a renal biopsy confirmed IgA nephropathy with significant vascular changes and focal segmental sclerosis. She requires four antihypertensive agents to maintain a target BP of <130/80 mmHg.

iga_nephropathy_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Familial IgA nephropathy
  presenting_complaint: Screening due to strong family history of ESRD
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male requested screening as his father and elder brother both have IgA nephropathy, with the father currently on haemodialysis. Screening revealed a BP of 128/82 mmHg, a creatinine of 85 µmol/L, but persistent microscopic haematuria on three separate occasions. A presumptive diagnosis of familial IgAN was made; he was started on a low-dose ACE inhibitor for primary prevention and is reviewed annually in the nephrology clinic.

iga_nephropathy_015:
  primary_diagnosis: IgA nephropathy associated with Celiac Disease
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss, diarrhoea, and incidental haematuria
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old woman presenting with malabsorption symptoms was diagnosed with Celiac disease (positive anti-tTG antibodies and Marsh IIIa histology). Routine urinalysis also showed microscopic haematuria and a uPCR of 90 mg/mmol. Renal biopsy confirmed IgAN, thought to be secondary to increased mucosal permeability and IgA production in the gut. Following a strict gluten-free diet, both her gastrointestinal symptoms and her proteinuria improved significantly.

iga_nephropathy_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Elderly-onset IgA nephropathy
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue and CKD stage 4 found during pre-operative assessment
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male undergoing workup for an elective hernia repair was found to have an eGFR of 22 mL/min/1.73m2. Despite his age, a renal biopsy was performed to exclude treatable causes of AKI, showing IgAN with advanced interstitial fibrosis (T2). Given his age and comorbidities (ischaemic heart disease and COPD), a conservative management plan was adopted, focusing on blood pressure control and avoiding nephrotoxic medications.

iga_nephropathy_017:
  primary_diagnosis: IgA nephropathy with Pulmonary-Renal Syndrome mimic
  presenting_complaint: Haemoptysis and acute renal failure
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male presented with cough, streaky haemoptysis, and a creatinine of 400 µmol/L. While ANCA-associated vasculitis and Anti-GBM disease were the primary differentials, serology was negative. Renal biopsy revealed IgA nephropathy with diffuse crescents and necrotising lesions. He was treated with plasma exchange and pulsed steroids for a "pulmonary-renal" presentation of crescentic IgAN, leading to cessation of haemoptysis and stabilisation of renal function.

iga_nephropathy_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild IgA nephropathy (Asymptomatic)
  presenting_complaint: Microscopic haematuria detected during pilot license medical
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old aspiring pilot was found to have persistent microscopic haematuria during his Class 1 medical examination. He was entirely asymptomatic with a BP of 118/74 mmHg, normal renal function, and a uPCR of 12 mg/mmol. A renal biopsy was deferred in favour of 6-monthly monitoring of BP and proteinuria. He remains stable after three years of follow-up with no evidence of disease progression.

iga_nephropathy_019:
  primary_diagnosis: IgA nephropathy flare following COVID-19 vaccination
  presenting_complaint: Macroscopic haematuria 48 hours after mRNA vaccine
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old male with known IgAN experienced a flare of visible haematuria and mild loin pain shortly after his second COVID-19 vaccination. His uPCR rose from 30 to 110 mg/mmol, and his creatinine increased slightly from 90 to 115 µmol/L. The episode was self-limiting, with all parameters returning to baseline within two weeks without specific intervention beyond temporary rest and hydration.

iga_nephropathy_020:
  primary_diagnosis: IgA nephropathy with comorbid Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA)
  presenting_complaint: Resistant hypertension and nocturnal polyuria
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old obese male (BMI 36) with biopsy-proven IgAN struggled with blood pressure control despite being on four agents. He was diagnosed with severe OSA (AHI 45) following a sleep study. Initiation of CPAP therapy led to a significant improvement in his blood pressure (150/95 to 132/84 mmHg) and a reduction in his uPCR from 140 to 75 mg/mmol, highlighting the impact of managing comorbidities on IgAN progression.
