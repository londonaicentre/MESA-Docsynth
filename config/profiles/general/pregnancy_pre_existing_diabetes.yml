pregnancy_pre_existing_diabetes_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Well-controlled Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Routine booking appointment at 8 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female with a 10-year history of T1DM presented for her initial antenatal booking. Pre-conception HbA1c was optimal at 44 mmol/mol, and she is currently using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and insulin pump. Management involves close multidisciplinary team (MDT) surveillance and adjustment of basal rates; pregnancy is progressing normally with no signs of retinopathy or nephropathy.

pregnancy_pre_existing_diabetes_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with Morbid Obesity in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Management of glucose levels at 14 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female (BMI 42 kg/m²) with T2DM was transitioned from gliclazide to metformin and basal-bolus insulin. Despite high-dose folic acid and aspirin, her HbA1c remains elevated at 58 mmol/mol. Serial growth scans have been scheduled to monitor for macrosomia, and she is receiving dietetic support for weight management.

pregnancy_pre_existing_diabetes_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) in Type 1 Diabetes
  presenting_complaint: Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain at 24 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old pregnant female presented acutely with Kussmaul breathing and ketones of 5.2 mmol/L following a viral illness. Arterial blood gas confirmed metabolic acidosis (pH 7.15, HCO3 12 mmol/L), requiring ICU admission for the fixed-rate insulin infusion protocol. The fetus remained stable on continuous monitoring, and the patient was stabilised over 48 hours before returning to her usual insulin regimen.

pregnancy_pre_existing_diabetes_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 2 Diabetes with Chronic Hypertension and Superimposed Pre-eclampsia
  presenting_complaint: Headache and peripheral oedema at 32 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female with long-standing T2DM and hypertension presented with a sudden BP spike of 165/110 mmHg and 2+ proteinuria. Bloods revealed elevated ALT and low platelets, consistent with pre-eclampsia complicating her pre-existing conditions. She underwent an emergency Caesarean section following administration of magnesium sulphate and betamethasone for fetal lung maturity.

pregnancy_pre_existing_diabetes_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 1 Diabetes with Severe Hypoglycaemia Unawareness
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent nocturnal collapses at 16 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female with T1DM reported several episodes of severe hypoglycaemia (capillary glucose <2.5 mmol/L) without warning symptoms. Her insulin sensitivity increased significantly in the early second trimester, necessitating a 20% reduction in her basal insulin dose. She was provided with a real-time CGM with predictive alerts to prevent further life-threatening episodes.

pregnancy_pre_existing_diabetes_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 2 Diabetes with Diabetic Nephropathy
  presenting_complaint: Increasing proteinuria and rising serum creatinine at 20 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old female with known diabetic nephropathy (baseline ACR 35 mg/mmol) presented with worsening renal function. Serum creatinine rose from 90 to 130 µmol/L, and blood pressure became difficult to control despite Nifedipine. MDT management focused on balancing renal preservation with fetal growth, eventually requiring delivery at 34 weeks due to worsening maternal renal failure.

pregnancy_pre_existing_diabetes_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 1 Diabetes with Proliferative Retinopathy Progression
  presenting_complaint: Blurred vision and floaters at 26 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female with pre-existing background retinopathy experienced rapid deterioration in visual acuity. Fundoscopy revealed new neovascularisation, likely exacerbated by rapid tightening of glycaemic control in early pregnancy. She underwent urgent pan-retinal photocoagulation (PRP) by the ophthalmology team while maintaining tight glucose targets.

pregnancy_pre_existing_diabetes_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 2 Diabetes with Fetal Macrosomia and Polyhydramnios
  presenting_complaint: Large for gestational age (LGA) fundal height at 34 weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 37-year-old female with poorly controlled T2DM (HbA1c 72 mmol/mol) presented with a symphysis-fundal height measuring 4cm ahead of dates. Ultrasound confirmed an estimated fetal weight (EFW) on the 98th centile and a liquor pocket of 12cm (polyhydramnios). Insulin doses were aggressively titrated, and an elective Caesarean section was planned for 37 weeks to mitigate the risk of shoulder dystocia.

pregnancy_pre_existing_diabetes_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 1 Diabetes with Gastroparesis
  presenting_complaint: Intractable vomiting and erratic glucose levels at 12 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old female with T1DM and known autonomic neuropathy presented with symptoms mimicking hyperemesis gravidarum. Delayed gastric emptying led to severe postprandial hypoglycaemia followed by delayed hyperglycaemia. Management involved small frequent meals, prokinetics, and switching to a split-dose insulin regimen to better match nutrient absorption.

pregnancy_pre_existing_diabetes_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Unbooked Type 2 Diabetes in Late Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: First presentation to maternity services at 28 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female presented for her first antenatal check-up with a random plasma glucose of 18.2 mmol/L. HbA1c was 85 mmol/mol, confirming pre-existing but previously undiagnosed T2DM. Immediate hospitalisation was required to initiate insulin therapy and perform a detailed fetal anomaly scan and echocardiogram due to the high risk of congenital malformations.

pregnancy_pre_existing_diabetes_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 1 Diabetes with Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR)
  presenting_complaint: Reduced fetal movements at 30 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old female with T1DM and microvascular complications presented with static fundal growth. Ultrasound revealed EFW on the 3rd centile with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler (absent end-diastolic flow). Despite her diabetes, the primary issue was placental insufficiency, leading to an urgent delivery via Caesarean section.

pregnancy_pre_existing_diabetes_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 2 Diabetes with Severe Insulin Resistance
  presenting_complaint: Escalating insulin requirements at 28 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old South Asian female with T2DM and PCOS required over 300 units of insulin daily to maintain euglycaemia. The marked insulin resistance of the third trimester necessitated the use of U-500 concentrated insulin. Despite the high doses, glycaemic targets were eventually met, and she delivered a healthy 3.8kg infant at 38 weeks.

pregnancy_pre_existing_diabetes_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 1 Diabetes with Addison's Disease (APS Type 2)
  presenting_complaint: Hypotension and hypoglycaemia at 10 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female with T1DM and autoimmune adrenal insufficiency presented with an Addisonian crisis triggered by pregnancy-related nausea. She required intravenous hydrocortisone and dextrose replacement. Her steroid and insulin requirements were carefully adjusted throughout the pregnancy to account for the physiological changes of each trimester.

pregnancy_pre_existing_diabetes_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 2 Diabetes post-Bariatric Surgery
  presenting_complaint: Postprandial dizziness and sweating at 22 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female with T2DM who previously underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass presented with "dumping syndrome" symptoms. Distinguishing between reactive hypoglycaemia and diabetic glycaemic excursions was challenging. Management involved low-glycaemic index nutrition and continuous glucose monitoring to guide insulin adjustments and prevent neuroglycopenia.

pregnancy_pre_existing_diabetes_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 1 Diabetes with Recurrent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent vaginal itching and discharge at 18 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female with T1DM (HbA1c 62 mmol/mol) suffered from refractory thrush. High vaginal swabs confirmed Candida albicans, which was resistant to initial topical treatments. Improved glycaemic control through more frequent insulin adjustments and a course of oral fluconazole (after careful risk-benefit discussion) finally resolved the symptoms.

pregnancy_pre_existing_diabetes_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 2 Diabetes with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD Stage 3)
  presenting_complaint: Routine renal and obstetric review at 12 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old female with T2DM and CKD (eGFR 45) required complex MDT care. Her medications were reviewed, stopping her ACE inhibitor and starting Labetalol. Close monitoring of her fluid balance and electrolyte status was essential, particularly as her insulin requirements dropped unexpectedly in the third trimester, raising concerns about placental or renal deterioration.

pregnancy_pre_existing_diabetes_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 1 Diabetes with Insulin Pump Failure
  presenting_complaint: Hyperglycaemia and ketosis at 35 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old female using an insulin pump presented with a glucose reading of 22 mmol/L and ketones of 1.8 mmol/L due to a cannula site occlusion. She was immediately transitioned to a manual "sick day" subcutaneous injection protocol. After replacing the pump hardware and ensuring the ketosis resolved, she was able to resume pump therapy under close supervision.

pregnancy_pre_existing_diabetes_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 2 Diabetes with HELLP Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Epigastric pain and malaise at 33 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female with T2DM presented with what she thought was severe "heartburn." Investigations showed haemolysis (low haptoglobin), elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (45 x 10^9/L). She was diagnosed with HELLP syndrome and required an immediate delivery and postpartum monitoring in a high-dependency unit.

pregnancy_pre_existing_diabetes_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 1 Diabetes with Diabulimia (Eating Disorder)
  presenting_complaint: Significant weight loss and high HbA1c at 20 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 23-year-old female with T1DM was found to be intentionally omitting insulin doses to control weight gain during pregnancy. This resulted in chronic hyperglycaemia (HbA1c 98 mmol/mol) and multiple admissions for mild ketosis. Intensive psychiatric support and a specialist diabetes-midwifery team were involved to manage the complex interplay of her mental health and diabetes.

pregnancy_pre_existing_diabetes_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 2 Diabetes with Polyhydramnios and Cord Prolapse
  presenting_complaint: Sudden gush of fluid and "something feeling wrong" at 36 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old female with T2DM and known polyhydramnios (AFI 30cm) suffered spontaneous rupture of membranes at home. On arrival at the hospital, an umbilical cord prolapse was diagnosed. She underwent an emergency "Category 1" Caesarean section; the neonate required NICU admission for hypoglycaemia management, while the mother's insulin was titrated down to pre-pregnancy levels.
