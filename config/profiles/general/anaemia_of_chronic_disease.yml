anaemia_of_chronic_disease_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Anaemia of chronic disease secondary to Rheumatoid Arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Progressive lethargy and worsening joint stiffness.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with a 15-year history of Rheumatoid Arthritis presented with worsening fatigue. Blood tests revealed a normocytic anaemia with Hb 94 g/L, serum ferritin 450 μg/L, and low TIBC. C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated at 56 mg/L, confirming active inflammation; Hb improved following escalation of Methotrexate and introduction of Adalimumab.

anaemia_of_chronic_disease_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Anaemia of chronic kidney disease (Stage 4)
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath on exertion and pallor.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male with Stage 4 CKD (eGFR 22 ml/min) presented to the renal clinic with symptomatic moderate anaemia (Hb 82 g/L). Investigations showed high ferritin (620 μg/L) but low transferrin saturation (18%), indicating functional iron deficiency common in ACD. He was commenced on Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents (ESA) and intravenous iron sucrose, resulting in a gradual Hb rise to 105 g/L.

anaemia_of_chronic_disease_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Anaemia of chronic disease secondary to Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent fever, rash, and malaise.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy with systemic JIA developed chronic normocytic anaemia (Hb 88 g/L). Despite oral iron supplementation, Hb remained low with a high ferritin of 800 μg/L and suppressed reticulocyte count. The anaemia was managed by targeting the underlying inflammatory process with Tocilizumab, leading to haematological recovery within 8 weeks.

anaemia_of_chronic_disease_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Mixed Anaemia of Chronic Disease and Iron Deficiency (Crohn's Disease)
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal pain, bloody stools, and profound weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old female with a severe flare of Crohn's disease presented with Hb 71 g/L. Clinical picture was complex, showing low MCV (72 fL) and low ferritin (12 μg/L) alongside high CRP (110 mg/L), suggesting a hybrid of IDA from blood loss and ACD from systemic inflammation. She required parenteral iron and high-dose corticosteroids to address both the deficiency and the inflammatory block.

anaemia_of_chronic_disease_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Anaemia of chronic disease secondary to occult Bronchogenic Carcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Unintentional weight loss and persistent dry cough.
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old male smoker presented with mild normocytic anaemia (Hb 102 g/L) discovered on routine screening. Further investigations for "anaemia of the elderly" revealed an elevated ESR (92 mm/hr) and a suspicious lung mass on CT. The anaemia was attributed to the inflammatory state of malignancy (ACD) rather than nutritional deficiency or marrow infiltration.

anaemia_of_chronic_disease_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Anaemia of Inflammation in Sepsis
  presenting_complaint: Hypotension, tachycardia, and altered mental state.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female was admitted to the ICU with urosepsis and multi-organ failure. Within 48 hours, her Hb dropped from 125 g/L to 78 g/L despite no evidence of haemorrhage or haemolysis. This acute ACD was driven by cytokine-mediated hepcidin elevation and splenic sequestration, requiring red cell transfusion due to cardiovascular instability.

anaemia_of_chronic_disease_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Anaemia of chronic disease secondary to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)
  presenting_complaint: Photosensitive rash, arthralgia, and fatigue.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female with SLE presented with a chronic Hb of 92 g/L. Investigations showed normocytic indices, high ferritin, and low serum iron, with a negative Coomb's test ruling out autoimmune haemolysis. The anaemia was successfully managed as ACD by controlling SLE activity with Mycophenolate Mofetil.

anaemia_of_chronic_disease_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Anaemia of chronic disease in Congestive Heart Failure
  presenting_complaint: Increased peripheral oedema and orthopnoea.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with NYHA Class III heart failure was found to have a stable but persistent anaemia (Hb 108 g/L). Extensive GI investigations were negative for bleeding, and iron stores were replete (ferritin 310 μg/L). The anaemia was classified as ACD related to chronic cardiac cachexia and cytokine activation, contributing to his reduced exercise tolerance.

anaemia_of_chronic_disease_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Anaemia of chronic disease secondary to Pulmonary Tuberculosis
  presenting_complaint: Night sweats, weight loss, and productive cough.
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old male recently arrived from a high-prevalence area was diagnosed with PTB. Baseline bloods showed moderate anaemia (Hb 85 g/L) with high inflammatory markers and a bone marrow biopsy showing increased iron stores but poor sideroblast incorporation. The anaemia resolved completely after four months of standard anti-tuberculous therapy (RIPE).

anaemia_of_chronic_disease_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Anaemia of Chronic Disease in Polymyalgia Rheumatica
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral shoulder girdle pain and morning stiffness.
  summary_of_course: A 71-year-old female presented with PMR and a significant anaemia (Hb 91 g/L). While her pain responded well to Prednisolone, her Hb remained low for several months despite normalisation of CRP. This represented a delayed recovery of ACD, eventually requiring a short course of oral iron once the inflammatory block had subsided.

anaemia_of_chronic_disease_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Anaemia of chronic disease secondary to HIV/AIDS
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent oral candidiasis and generalised lymphadenopathy.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male with poorly controlled HIV (CD4 count 120) presented with chronic fatigue and Hb 79 g/L. Bone marrow aspirate confirmed ACD with no evidence of opportunistic infection or lymphoma in the marrow. Initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) led to a gradual improvement in Hb as the viral load became undetectable.

anaemia_of_chronic_disease_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Anaemia of chronic disease secondary to Bronchiectasis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent chest infections and chronic sputum production.
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old female with non-CF bronchiectasis and chronic Pseudomonas colonisation maintained a baseline Hb of 98 g/L. During infective exacerbations, her Hb would drop further to 85 g/L. This pattern of chronic inflammation-driven anaemia was managed with aggressive pulmonary toilet and prophylactic antibiotics rather than iron therapy.

anaemia_of_chronic_disease_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Anaemia of chronic disease secondary to Obesity-related Inflammation
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic mild anaemia on pre-operative screening.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with a BMI of 48 kg/m² was found to have Hb 115 g/L during workup for bariatric surgery. Ferritin was 350 μg/L and CRP was chronically mildly elevated (12 mg/L) with no other identifiable cause. This was attributed to adipose-tissue-derived inflammatory cytokines causing mild ACD.

anaemia_of_chronic_disease_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Anaemia of chronic disease secondary to Multiple Myeloma
  presenting_complaint: New onset back pain and hypercalcaemia.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male presented with severe normocytic anaemia (Hb 74 g/L). Plasma cell dyscrasia was diagnosed via serum protein electrophoresis and marrow biopsy. The anaemia was multifactorial but primarily driven by ACD (cytokine-mediated) and marrow crowding, requiring bortezomib-based chemotherapy and blood transfusions.

anaemia_of_chronic_disease_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Anaemia of chronic disease secondary to Chronic Osteomyelitis
  presenting_complaint: Non-healing ulcer and bone pain in the left tibia.
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old diabetic male developed chronic osteomyelitis following a fracture. He presented with a subacute anaemia (Hb 89 g/L) and high ferritin (550 μg/L). The anaemia was refractory to iron supplements but resolved following surgical debridement and a 6-week course of targeted intravenous antibiotics.

anaemia_of_chronic_disease_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Anaemia of chronic disease secondary to Sarcoidosis
  presenting_complaint: Dyspnoea and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male with biopsy-proven sarcoidosis presented with moderate anaemia (Hb 96 g/L). Serum ACE levels were high, and iron studies showed a classic ACD pattern. Treatment with Methotrexate as a steroid-sparing agent led to remission of the sarcoidosis and subsequent correction of the haemoglobin levels.

anaemia_of_chronic_disease_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Anaemia of chronic disease secondary to Infected Pressure Ulcers
  presenting_complaint: Grade 4 sacral pressure sore and low-grade pyrexia.
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old bedbound nursing home resident was admitted with a septic sacral ulcer and Hb 80 g/L. The anaemia was normochromic and normocytic with high inflammatory markers (CRP 140 mg/L). Clinical management focused on wound care and nutrition, as the ACD was driven by the chronic soft tissue infection.

anaemia_of_chronic_disease_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Anaemia of chronic disease secondary to Psoriatic Arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Extensive skin plaques and dactylitis.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with severe psoriatic arthritis presented with worsening fatigue and Hb 101 g/L. Despite normal iron stores, her Hb remained low until her skin and joint disease were brought under control with Secukinumab. This case highlights ACD as a common extra-articular manifestation of severe psoriasis.

anaemia_of_chronic_disease_019:
  primary_diagnosis: ESA-resistant Anaemia of Chronic Disease (End-stage Renal Disease)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent severe anaemia despite high-dose Epoetin.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male on haemodialysis remained severely anaemic (Hb 72 g/L) despite maximal doses of Erythropoietin. Investigations showed a very high ferritin (1200 μg/L) and CRP (80 mg/L) due to a chronic tunnelled catheter infection. The anaemia was classified as ESA-resistant ACD, which improved only after the infected line was removed.

anaemia_of_chronic_disease_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Anaemia of chronic disease secondary to Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA)
  presenting_complaint: New onset headache, jaw claudication, and scalp tenderness.
  summary_of_course: A 76-year-old male presented with classic GCA symptoms and an incidental finding of Hb 95 g/L. His ESR was 115 mm/hr. Following the initiation of high-dose Prednisolone (60mg), his inflammatory markers plummeted, and his Hb returned to 130 g/L within six weeks, confirming the diagnosis of ACD secondary to vasculitis.
