arterial_ulcer_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic arterial insufficiency ulcer
  presenting_complaint: Painful, non-healing sore on the right hallux and nocturnal rest pain.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male smoker with hypertension presented with a "punched-out" 1.5cm ulcer on the distal tip of the right great toe. Clinical examination revealed absent dorsalis pedis pulses, cool skin, and an ABPI of 0.42. Following a CT angiogram showing significant superficial femoral artery stenosis, he underwent successful balloon angioplasty and commenced dual antiplatelet therapy, resulting in ulcer healing over three months.

arterial_ulcer_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Infected arterial ulcer with cellulitis
  presenting_complaint: Worsening pain, redness, and foul-smelling discharge from a left foot wound.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with Type 2 diabetes and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) presented with a necrotic ulcer on the lateral malleolus. Swabs grew Staphylococcus aureus, and CRP was elevated at 85 mg/L. She was admitted for IV flucloxacillin, surgical debridement of devitalised tissue, and urgent revascularisation via femoro-distal bypass to salvage the limb.

arterial_ulcer_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Critical limb ischaemia with gangrenous ulceration
  presenting_complaint: Blackening of the third and fourth toes with excruciating rest pain.
  summary_of_course: An 81-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction presented with dry gangrene of the lesser toes and a deep arterial ulcer on the metatarsal head. Angiography demonstrated multi-level occlusive disease unsuitable for intervention. Due to intractable pain and spreading wet gangrene, he underwent a below-knee amputation (BKA) and subsequent rehabilitation.

arterial_ulcer_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease)
  presenting_complaint: Multiple small, painful ulcers on fingertips and toes.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male heavy smoker presented with digital ischaemia and small, shallow arterial ulcers on the left index finger and right second toe. Investigations showed normal proximal pulses but occluded distal vessels on angiography ("corkscrew" collaterals). He was managed with strict smoking cessation and iloprost infusions, which led to significant symptom improvement and ulcer resolution.

arterial_ulcer_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild arterial claudication with pretibial ulceration
  presenting_complaint: Small, painful ulcer on the shin following minor trauma.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female with hyperlipidaemia presented with a 1cm superficial ulcer over the mid-shin that failed to heal with standard dressings. ABPI was 0.75, indicating moderate arterial impairment. Management focused on secondary prevention (statin, aspirin), supervised exercise, and non-adherent dressings, resulting in complete healing within eight weeks.

arterial_ulcer_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic arterial ulceration
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of a pre-existing heel ulcer and cold foot.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with known PAD and a chronic heel ulcer presented with sudden-onset coldness and pallor of the left foot. Duplex ultrasound confirmed acute thrombosis of the popliteal artery. He underwent emergency catheter-directed thrombolysis and subsequent stenting, which restored perfusion and allowed the chronic ulcer to begin granulating.

arterial_ulcer_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Mixed arterial-venous leg ulcer
  presenting_complaint: Large, painful ulcer on the medial calf with significant swelling.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female presented with a 4cm ulcer showing features of both venous hypertension (haemosiderin staining) and arterial insufficiency (pale wound bed, ABPI 0.6). High-compression bandaging was contraindicated due to the arterial component. She was managed with modified reduced-compression wraps and endovascular iliac vein stenting alongside arterial optimization, leading to gradual wound closure.

arterial_ulcer_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Arterial ulcer secondary to popliteal artery aneurysm
  presenting_complaint: Painful ulcer on the sole of the foot and a pulsatile mass behind the knee.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male presented with a deep plantar ulcer. Physical exam revealed a large pulsatile mass in the popliteal fossa; ultrasound confirmed a 4cm aneurysm with distal embolisation (blue toe syndrome). He underwent aneurysm exclusion and bypass grafting, which stopped the embolic showers and allowed the plantar ulcer to heal.

arterial_ulcer_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Martorell hypertensive ischaemic leg ulcer
  presenting_complaint: Extremely painful, rapidly enlarging ulcer on the posterolateral calf.
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old female with long-standing, poorly controlled hypertension presented with a necrotic ulcer with a purpuric border. Despite palpable peripheral pulses and an ABPI of 0.9, the diagnosis of Martorell ulcer was made based on clinical features and skin biopsy showing stenotic arteriolosclerosis. Treatment involved aggressive blood pressure control, surgical debridement, and skin grafting.

arterial_ulcer_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Arterial ulcer with underlying osteomyelitis
  presenting_complaint: Deep, non-healing ulcer over the lateral malleolus with visible bone.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male with severe PAD presented with a chronic ulcer where bone was palpable on probing (Probe-to-Bone positive). MRI confirmed T1 marrow signal changes consistent with osteomyelitis. He required a six-week course of targeted IV antibiotics and a distal bypass to provide the necessary blood flow for bone healing and wound closure.

arterial_ulcer_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Calciphylaxis-related arterial ulceration
  presenting_complaint: Symmetrical, exquisitely painful necrotic plaques and ulcers on the thighs.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with end-stage renal disease on haemodialysis presented with livedo reticularis and necrotic ulcers. Skin biopsy confirmed medial calcification of small cutaneous arteries (calciphylaxis). Management included sodium thiosulphate infusions, optimization of calcium-phosphate balance, and intensive wound care, though the prognosis remained guarded.

arterial_ulcer_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent arterial ulcer post-bypass failure
  presenting_complaint: Breakdown of a previously healed ulcer site on the left heel.
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old male, three years post-femoropopliteal bypass, presented with a recurrent 2cm arterial ulcer. Graft surveillance ultrasound revealed a high-grade stenosis at the distal anastomosis. He underwent a vein patch angioplasty of the graft, which successfully restored distal perfusion and led to rapid re-epithelialisation of the heel ulcer.

arterial_ulcer_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Arterial ulceration in Polyarteritis Nodosa
  presenting_complaint: Multiple painful ulcers on the lower legs and systemic malaise.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female presented with fever, weight loss, and "starburst" livedo with small arterial ulcers. Investigations revealed elevated ESR and microaneurysms on renal angiography, confirming systemic vasculitis (PAN). Ulcers healed only after the initiation of high-dose corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide to treat the underlying vascular inflammation.

arterial_ulcer_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Pressure-induced arterial ulcer (Elderly/Frailty)
  presenting_complaint: Deep necrotic ulcer on the heel of a bedbound patient.
  summary_of_course: An 89-year-old female with advanced dementia and PAD was found to have a Category 4 pressure ulcer on her left heel. Given her poor arterial supply (ABPI 0.35), the wound was unable to heal and became necrotic. Management focused on palliative wound care, pressure relief, and analgesia, as she was not a candidate for invasive revascularisation.

arterial_ulcer_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Arterial ulcer with Monckeberg’s sclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Painful toe ulcer with an abnormally high ABPI reading.
  summary_of_course: A 71-year-old male with T2DM presented with a classic arterial ulcer on the fifth digit. Initial ABPI was 1.4, suggestive of incompressible vessels due to Monckeberg’s medial calcific sclerosis. Toe pressures were subsequently measured at 20 mmHg (severely ischaemic), and he was referred for urgent endovascular intervention to prevent digital loss.

arterial_ulcer_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Ischaemic ulcer secondary to Raynaud's phenomenon
  presenting_complaint: Small, pitted ulcers on the tips of the fingers.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female with systemic sclerosis presented with digital pitting and a painful ulcer on the right middle finger. Thermography confirmed severe vasospasm. Treatment included nifedipine, sildenafil, and local wound care; Bosentan was later added to prevent the formation of new digital ulcers.

arterial_ulcer_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Arterial ulceration due to Atheroembolic disease
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of "blue toes" and small painful ulcers after cardiac catheterisation.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male developed multiple small, painful ischaemic ulcers on both feet 48 hours after an angioplasty. Laboratory tests showed eosinophilia and rising creatinine, suggesting cholesterol embolisation syndrome. Management was supportive with statins and antiplatelets, focusing on preventing further embolic events while the small ulcers slowly healed.

arterial_ulcer_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute arterial ulceration in a paediatric patient
  presenting_complaint: Non-healing foot ulcer in a child with Takayasu arteritis.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old girl with known Takayasu arteritis presented with a painful 1cm ulcer on the lateral border of her left foot. Imaging showed narrowing of the descending aorta and iliac arteries. The ulcer improved following an escalation in immunosuppressive therapy and a percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the left common iliac artery.

arterial_ulcer_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Arterial ulceration from Popliteal Entrapment Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Calf pain and a non-healing ulcer on the foot of a young athlete.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male runner presented with an arterial ulcer on the first metatarsal head and severe claudication. MRI revealed an anomalous insertion of the gastrocnemius muscle compressing the popliteal artery. Surgical release of the muscle and arterial reconstruction resulted in the restoration of pulses and rapid ulcer healing.

arterial_ulcer_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe arterial ulcer with septicaemia
  presenting_complaint: Rigors, confusion, and a large, necrotic, malodorous leg ulcer.
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old male was admitted to the ICU with urosepsis and an infected arterial ulcer on the shin. Blood cultures were positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Following stabilisation with vasopressors and IV antibiotics, he underwent a limb-saving popliteal-to-pedal bypass once the systemic infection was controlled, allowing for eventual skin grafting.
