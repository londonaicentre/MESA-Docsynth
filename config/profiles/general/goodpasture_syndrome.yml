goodpasture_syndrome_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Goodpasture Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Haemoptysis and macroscopic haematuria.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male smoker presented with a 3-day history of coughing up blood and dark urine. Investigations revealed a serum creatinine of 450 µmol/L and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on CXR. Anti-GBM titres were significantly elevated; he was treated with urgent plasmapheresis, prednisolone, and cyclophosphamide, resulting in stabilised renal function.

goodpasture_syndrome_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Renal-limited anti-GBM disease
  presenting_complaint: Progressive lethargy and oliguria.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female presented with a two-week history of worsening malaise and reduced urine output. Admission bloods showed a creatinine of 820 µmol/L with no respiratory symptoms or radiological lung abnormalities. Renal biopsy confirmed linear IgG deposition; despite intensive immunosuppression, she remained dialysis-dependent.

goodpasture_syndrome_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Fulminant Goodpasture Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Severe respiratory distress and haemoptysis.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male was admitted to the ICU with life-threatening diffuse alveolar haemorrhage requiring mechanical ventilation. Initial labs showed acute kidney injury (Stage 3) and high-titre anti-GBM antibodies. He underwent daily plasma exchange and pulse methylprednisolone, eventually weaning from the ventilator after 14 days.

goodpasture_syndrome_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute Goodpasture Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Persistent cough and iron-deficiency anaemia.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old woman presented to her GP with a chronic dry cough and microcytic anaemia (Hb 8.2 g/dL). Urinalysis revealed microscopic haematuria and proteinuria (+2), prompting a renal referral. Biopsy showed crescentic glomerulonephritis with positive anti-GBM staining, and she responded well to oral immunosuppressants.

goodpasture_syndrome_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric anti-GBM disease
  presenting_complaint: Vomiting, pallor, and tea-coloured urine.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old boy presented following a viral prodrome with sudden onset haematuria and hypertension. Investigations confirmed rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) with positive anti-GBM antibodies. He was treated with a paediatric vasculitis protocol including rituximab and steroids, achieving partial renal recovery.

goodpasture_syndrome_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Goodpasture Syndrome with secondary infection
  presenting_complaint: Fever, dyspnoea, and haemoptysis.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male undergoing treatment for Goodpasture Syndrome presented with new-onset fever and worsening hypoxia. While anti-GBM titres were falling, bronchoalveolar lavage confirmed Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) alongside residual alveolar haemorrhage. Treatment was adjusted to include co-trimoxazole while continuing reduced-dose steroids.

goodpasture_syndrome_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Double-positive vasculitis (anti-GBM and MPO-ANCA)
  presenting_complaint: Systemic vasculitic symptoms and renal failure.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female presented with weight loss, arthralgia, and a creatinine of 500 µmol/L. Serology was positive for both MPO-ANCA and anti-GBM antibodies. She followed a combined treatment regimen for systemic vasculitis and anti-GBM disease, showing a slower recovery than typical single-positive cases.

goodpasture_syndrome_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Goodpasture Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent mild haemoptysis.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old non-smoker presented with intermittent blood-streaked sputum but normal renal function (creatinine 75 µmol/L). Urinalysis showed only trace blood, but anti-GBM titres were mildly elevated. Early intervention with steroids and mycophenolate mofetil prevented the development of overt renal failure.

goodpasture_syndrome_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Anti-GBM disease with hydrocarbon exposure
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of shortness of breath and haematuria.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old mechanic presented after heavy exposure to industrial solvents with sudden pulmonary haemorrhage. Serology confirmed high-titre anti-GBM antibodies. The case was managed as an acute environmental trigger of Goodpasture Syndrome with plasma exchange and cyclophosphamide.

goodpasture_syndrome_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Goodpasture Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Persistent haematuria despite treatment.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male failed to respond to standard plasmapheresis and cyclophosphamide for anti-GBM disease. His creatinine continued to rise, and anti-GBM titres remained high. Salvage therapy with rituximab was initiated, which eventually led to seroconversion, though he required long-term haemodialysis.

goodpasture_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Goodpasture Syndrome in an elderly patient
  presenting_complaint: Confusion and fluid overload.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male was admitted with suspected heart failure, but further testing revealed a creatinine of 650 µmol/L and nephritic sediment. Anti-GBM antibodies were positive. Due to frailty, a modified treatment plan with lower-dose steroids and plasma exchange was implemented to balance efficacy and side effects.

goodpasture_syndrome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Isolated pulmonary anti-GBM disease
  presenting_complaint: Severe haemoptysis and hypoxia.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old heavy smoker presented with massive pulmonary haemorrhage but entirely normal renal function and urinalysis. Lung biopsy/BAL confirmed anti-GBM mediated damage. He was treated aggressively for pulmonary Goodpasture, and smoking cessation was strictly enforced to prevent recurrence.

goodpasture_syndrome_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic renal failure in anti-GBM disease
  presenting_complaint: Sudden decline in renal function.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old with known Stage 3 CKD (hypertensive) presented with a rapid rise in creatinine from 180 to 550 µmol/L over one week. New-onset haemoptysis prompted anti-GBM testing, which was positive. The underlying CKD complicated the prognosis, resulting in end-stage renal failure despite treatment.

goodpasture_syndrome_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Goodpasture Syndrome (Seronegative)
  presenting_complaint: RPGN and pulmonary infiltrates.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented with classic pulmonary-renal syndrome but negative ELISA for anti-GBM antibodies. A renal biopsy was performed, showing pathognomonic linear IgG deposition on the basement membrane. She was treated based on biopsy findings with standard therapy and achieved clinical remission.

goodpasture_syndrome_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Relapsed anti-GBM disease
  presenting_complaint: Return of haematuria 12 months post-treatment.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male, who previously achieved remission for Goodpasture Syndrome, presented with new microscopic haematuria. Rising anti-GBM titres were detected, which is rare for this condition. He was restarted on immunosuppression, and a search for new environmental triggers was conducted.

goodpasture_syndrome_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Goodpasture Syndrome with pulmonary embolus
  presenting_complaint: Pleuritic chest pain and haemoptysis.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female with Goodpasture Syndrome developed sudden pleuritic pain during her hospital stay. While haemoptysis was initially attributed to alveolar haemorrhage, a CTPA confirmed a concurrent pulmonary embolism. Management required careful balancing of anticoagulation in the context of active pulmonary bleeding.

goodpasture_syndrome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Goodpasture Syndrome in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Proteinuria and breathlessness in the third trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old pregnant woman at 32 weeks gestation developed sudden renal impairment and mild haemoptysis. Post-delivery (emergency C-section), anti-GBM disease was confirmed. She was treated with plasma exchange and steroids postpartum, with careful monitoring of neonatal renal function.

goodpasture_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Goodpasture Syndrome presenting as "Chest Infection"
  presenting_complaint: Productive cough and malaise.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male was treated twice with amoxicillin for a suspected chest infection by his GP. Lack of response and the development of ankle oedema led to blood tests showing a creatinine of 300 µmol/L. Anti-GBM titres were positive, highlighting the risk of diagnostic delay in community settings.

goodpasture_syndrome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent anti-GBM disease in renal transplant
  presenting_complaint: Graft dysfunction and haematuria.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male, five years post-renal transplant for unknown ESRF, developed sudden graft failure. Biopsy of the allograft showed linear IgG staining and crescent formation consistent with anti-GBM disease. High-dose steroids and plasmapheresis were initiated to salvage the graft.

goodpasture_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Goodpasture Syndrome with alveolar-capillary block
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive respiratory failure.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female presented with extreme hypoxia out of proportion to her CXR findings. Transfer to a tertiary centre for ECMO was required due to severe diffuse alveolar haemorrhage from Goodpasture Syndrome. While on ECMO, she received pulse steroids and plasma exchange, eventually recovering lung function.
