  presenting_complaint: Worsening headache and visual disturbances 48 hours after delivery.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female, initially normotensive during labour, developed sudden hypertension (170/110 mmHg) postpartum. Laboratory tests confirmed haemolysis (haptoglobin <0.1 g/L) and a platelet drop to 62 x 10^9/L. She was treated with intravenous hydralazine and magnesium sulphate, showing gradual recovery over five days.

hellp_syndrome_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild HELLP syndrome (Class 3)
  presenting_complaint: Routine midwife check at 36 weeks showing proteinuria and mild hypertension.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old multipara with pre-existing chronic hypertension was found to have new-onset proteinuria. Bloods showed borderline thrombocytopenia (115 x 10^9/L) and elevated AST (85 U/L). She was diagnosed with Class 3 HELLP and underwent a successful induction of labour with no further complications.

hellp_syndrome_004:
  primary_diagnosis: HELLP syndrome with hepatic subcapsular haematoma
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset collapse and severe right upper quadrant pain at 34 weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old G2P1 presented in hypovolaemic shock. Imaging confirmed a ruptured subcapsular liver haematoma secondary to severe HELLP syndrome. She required an emergency laparotomy, hepatic packing, and massive transfusion protocol alongside delivery of the neonate.

hellp_syndrome_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Early-onset HELLP syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Generalised malaise and oedema at 23 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old presented with significant peripheral oedema and "flu-like" symptoms. Investigations revealed Class 2 HELLP syndrome (platelets 75 x 10^9/L) and severe intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).

  primary_diagnosis: Severe HELLP syndrome in elderly primigravida
  presenting_complaint: Frontal headache and epigastric discomfort at 33 weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 46-year-old who conceived via IVF presented with BP 180/115 mmHg. Laboratory results showed AST 400 U/L and platelets 28 x 10^9/L. Due to the severity of the biochemical derangement and maternal age, she was delivered via urgent caesarean section following magnesium sulphate loading.

hellp_syndrome_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Normotensive HELLP syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Vague abdominal pain and nausea, BP normal at 120/75 mmHg.
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old presented to the triage unit at 35 weeks with symptoms mimicking viral gastritis. Despite normal blood pressure and no proteinuria, blood tests showed ALT 320 U/L and platelets 55 x 10^9/L. The diagnosis of normotensive HELLP was made, and she was delivered promptly.

hellp_syndrome_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent HELLP syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Monitoring at 29 weeks due to high-risk history.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old G3P2 with a history of HELLP in her first pregnancy at 31 weeks was being closely monitored. Despite prophylactic aspirin, her platelets began to trend downwards (140 to 90 x 10^9/L) and ALT rose to 180 U/L. She was admitted for inpatient surveillance and delivered at 30 weeks when parameters worsened.

hellp_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: HELLP syndrome with Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)
  presenting_complaint: Reduced urine output and dark urine at 32 weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old presented with oliguria and jaundice. Tests showed a creatinine of 380 µmol/L, LDH 2500 U/L, and platelets 45 x 10^9/L. Diagnosis of severe HELLP with associated AKI was made; she required temporary haemodialysis postpartum but eventually regained full renal function.

hellp_syndrome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Late-onset postpartum HELLP syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Severe RUQ pain 5 days after an uncomplicated delivery.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old presented to A&E five days after discharge. She was found to have a platelet count of 30 x 10^9/L and significantly elevated liver enzymes. She was readmitted to the obstetric HDU for magnesium sulphate and dexamethasone, with a slow recovery over one week.

hellp_syndrome_013:

  presenting_complaint: Jaundice, hypoglycaemia, and confusion at 36 weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old presented with signs of hepatic failure. While initially suspected to be AFLP due to low glucose and prolonged PT/APTT, the presence of microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia and severe hypertension pointed towards HELLP. She was managed in ICU with supportive care and prompt delivery.

hellp_syndrome_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe HELLP syndrome in adolescent pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Significant facial oedema and headache at 34 weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old with late booking and minimal antenatal care presented with BP 190/125 mmHg. Laboratory results showed Class 1 HELLP (platelets 18 x 10^9/L). She was treated with labetalol and magnesium sulphate infusions and delivered via caesarean section under general anaesthesia.

hellp_syndrome_015:
  primary_diagnosis: HELLP syndrome with Pulmonary Oedema
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath and orthopnoea at 31 weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old presented with acute respiratory distress and oxygen saturations of 86% on room air. Clinical examination and ultrasound confirmed pulmonary oedema alongside Class 2 HELLP syndrome. She required CPAP ventilation and urgent delivery to facilitate maternal stabilisation.

hellp_syndrome_016:
  primary_diagnosis: HELLP syndrome in twin pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly increasing abdominal girth and RUQ pain at 30 weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old with DCDA twins presented with sudden clinical deterioration. Bloods revealed ALT 680 U/L and platelets 52 x 10^9/L. Because of the increased metabolic demand of a twin pregnancy, her condition progressed rapidly, necessitating immediate delivery and HDU admission.

hellp_syndrome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute HELLP syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Persistent "heartburn" and mild malaise for one week.
  summary_of_course: A 37-year-old at 33 weeks gestation had been treating herself for GORD. On presentation, she was mildly hypertensive (145/95 mmHg); bloods showed a haptoglobin of <0.1 g/L and ALT 145 U/L, confirming a subacute presentation of HELLP syndrome. She was admitted for stabilisation and delivery.

hellp_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: HELLP syndrome with Eclampsia
  presenting_complaint: Tonic-clonic seizure at home at 35 weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old was brought in by ambulance following a seizure. Post-ictal bloods showed platelets of 48 x 10^9/L and AST 520 U/L, consistent with eclampsia and HELLP syndrome. She was commenced on a magnesium sulphate protocol and delivered via emergency caesarean section.

hellp_syndrome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory HELLP syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Persistent thrombocytopenia 72 hours post-delivery.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old was delivered for HELLP syndrome at 34 weeks, but her platelets remained <20 x 10^9/L despite high-dose steroids and delivery. Due to the lack of biochemical improvement, she underwent plasma exchange (plasmapheresis) in the ICU, which eventually led to the recovery of her platelet count.

hellp_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: HELLP syndrome with exudative retinal detachment
  presenting_complaint: Sudden bilateral blurred vision and RUQ pain at 32 weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old presented with visual loss; ophthalmological exam revealed bilateral serous retinal detachments. Concurrent bloods showed LDH 1800 U/L and platelets 40 x 10^9/L. Following delivery and control of blood pressure/HELLP, her subretinal fluid resolved, and her vision returned to baseline over several weeks.
