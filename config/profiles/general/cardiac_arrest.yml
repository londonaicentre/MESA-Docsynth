  primary_diagnosis: Hypothermic cardiac arrest
  presenting_complaint: Found unresponsive in an unheated dwelling.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female was found by neighbours in winter with a core temperature of 26°C. She was in a slow PEA rhythm which transitioned to asystole during transport. Management involved prolonged CPR and active internal rewarming in the ITU; she achieved ROSC once her core temperature reached 32°C.

cardiac_arrest_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM)
  presenting_complaint: Collapse during high-intensity exercise.
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old university rugby player collapsed during a match. Paramedics documented VF, which was refractory to the first three shocks but responded to amiodarone and a fourth shock. Subsequent investigations revealed asymmetrical septal hypertrophy, and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) was fitted for secondary prevention.

cardiac_arrest_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute myocardial infarction with VF arrest
  presenting_complaint: Crushing chest pain followed by loss of consciousness in A&E.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female presented to the emergency department with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). While being prepped for the cath lab, she developed VF; she was immediately defibrillated with a single 200J shock. She underwent successful stenting of the left anterior descending artery and made a full recovery.

cardiac_arrest_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Septic shock leading to cardiac arrest
  presenting_complaint: Hypotension and multi-organ failure.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male in the ICU with faecal peritonitis and septic shock suffered a PEA arrest. Despite ongoing vasopressor support and ALS, the arrest was deemed a terminal event due to refractory metabolic acidosis and multi-organ failure. After 20 minutes of unsuccessful resuscitation, the decision was made to cease efforts.

cardiac_arrest_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Amniotic fluid embolism
  presenting_complaint: Sudden collapse and haemorrhage during active labour.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old G2P1 female in the second stage of labour developed sudden hypoxia and seizures, followed by cardiac arrest (PEA). A perimortem caesarean section was performed in the delivery suite within 4 minutes while CPR continued. ROSC was achieved post-delivery, though the patient required massive transfusion for subsequent disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

  primary_diagnosis: Cardiac tamponade
  presenting_complaint: Sudden hypotension and PEA post-cardiac surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male, 12 hours post-CABG, developed sudden-onset hypotension and rising central venous pressure. He progressed to PEA arrest; an emergency bedside re-sternotomy was performed in the ICU. Evacuation of a large mediastinal haematoma resulted in immediate ROSC and haemodynamic stability.

cardiac_arrest_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Brugada syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Nocturnal agonal breathing and unresponsiveness.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male was noted by his partner to be making "gurgling" sounds in his sleep before becoming unresponsive. His partner performed CPR until paramedics arrived and shocked him out of VF. Subsequent ECGs with a procainamide challenge confirmed a Type 1 Brugada pattern, and he received an ICD.

cardiac_arrest_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic cardiac arrest during coronary intervention
  presenting_complaint: Acute vessel occlusion during PCI.
  summary_of_course: During an elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for stable angina, a 50-year-old male suffered a coronary artery dissection. This led to immediate ST-elevation and VF arrest. He was resuscitated with internal defibrillation and the dissection was covered with an emergency stent, leading to ROSC.
