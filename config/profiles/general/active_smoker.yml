active_smoker_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease)
  presenting_complaint: Severe rest pain and cyanosis of the right hallux
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male active smoker presented with digital ischaemia and painful ulceration of the toes. Angiography demonstrated "corkscrew" collaterals and distal arterial occlusions with no evidence of atherosclerosis. He was advised that absolute smoking cessation was the only definitive treatment to prevent limb amputation; however, he continues to smoke 5 cigarettes daily.

active_smoker_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung
  presenting_complaint: Persistent haemoptysis and 5kg weight loss over two months
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female, a lifelong active smoker, underwent a CT chest which revealed a 4cm hilar mass and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Bronchoscopy and biopsy confirmed squamous cell carcinoma (T3N1M0). She has commenced palliative radiotherapy and is being supported by the Macmillan team while continuing to smoke for stress relief.

active_smoker_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)
  presenting_complaint: Reduced symphysis-fundal height at 28 weeks gestation
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old primigravida, an active smoker of 10 cigarettes per day, was found to have a foetal abdominal circumference below the 3rd centile on ultrasound. Doppler studies showed increased umbilical artery resistance. Despite intensive counselling regarding the risks of placental insufficiency, she has struggled to reduce her tobacco intake, and the pregnancy is being managed as high-risk.

active_smoker_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary spontaneous pneumothorax
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old tall, thin male who is an active smoker of both tobacco and cannabis presented with acute right-sided chest pain. Chest X-ray showed a 30% pneumothorax with no tracheal deviation. He was managed with a small-bore chest drain and counselled that his smoking habit significantly increases the risk of recurrence.

active_smoker_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Peripheral arterial disease with intermittent claudication
  presenting_complaint: Cramping calf pain triggered by walking 50 yards
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male active smoker (20/day) presented with bilateral leg pain relieved by rest. Ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) was 0.65 on the right and 0.70 on the left. He was started on atorvastatin and clopidogrel and enrolled in a supervised exercise programme, with strong emphasis on smoking cessation to prevent progression to critical limb ischaemia.

active_smoker_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-operative wound dehiscence
  presenting_complaint: Purulent discharge and opening of a surgical wound following hernia repair
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male active smoker underwent an elective inguinal hernia repair seven days ago. He presented with a breakdown of the surgical site and localized cellulitis. Clinical assessment attributed the poor wound healing to reduced tissue oxygenation and microvascular dysfunction caused by chronic nicotine use; he required surgical debridement and prolonged vacuum-assisted closure therapy.

active_smoker_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic dry cough and progressive exertional dyspnoea
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old female active smoker presented with insidious onset of breathlessness. HRCT showed diffuse centrilobular nodules and ground-glass opacities. Pulmonary function tests revealed a mild restrictive pattern with reduced DLCO; the diagnosis of RB-ILD was made based on clinical and radiological findings, with significant improvement noted after she successfully switched to NRT.

active_smoker_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder
  presenting_complaint: Painless macroscopic haemoptysis
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male, an active smoker for 45 years, reported three episodes of bright red blood in his urine. Flexible cystoscopy identified a papillary tumour near the left ureteric orifice. He underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT), and histology confirmed high-grade T1 disease, with smoking identified as the primary aetiological factor.

active_smoker_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Poorly controlled asthma
  presenting_complaint: Nocturnal wheezing and frequent use of salbutamol inhaler
  summary_of_course: A 17-year-old female with a history of childhood asthma recently started smoking 5-10 cigarettes a day. Her asthma control has deteriorated, with a peak flow variability of 30% and frequent exacerbations. She was escalated to MART (Maintenance and Reliever Therapy) and provided with education on how smoking induces corticosteroid resistance in the airways.

active_smoker_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Perforated peptic ulcer
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset "board-like" abdominal rigidity and epigastric pain
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male active smoker presented to A&E in shock. Erect chest X-ray showed free air under the diaphragm (pneumoperitoneum). He underwent an emergency laparotomy and Graham patch repair of a perforated duodenal ulcer; his smoking habit was noted as a major risk factor for ulcer development and delayed mucosal healing.

active_smoker_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Graves' ophthalmopathy
  presenting_complaint: Gritty sensation in eyes, double vision, and prominent eyeballs
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female with hyperthyroidism and a heavy active smoking history presented with significant proptosis and lid lag. Clinical Activity Score (CAS) was 4/7, indicating active disease. She was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone and warned that continued smoking significantly reduces the efficacy of treatment and increases the risk of permanent visual loss.

active_smoker_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Clozapine toxicity secondary to smoking cessation attempt
  presenting_complaint: Severe sedation, hypersalivation, and tachycardia
  summary_of_course: A 43-year-old male with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, a heavy active smoker (30/day), suddenly stopped smoking three days ago. He presented with signs of clozapine toxicity as the absence of tobacco smoke-induced CYP1A2 enzymes led to a 50% rise in serum clozapine levels. His dose was urgently adjusted, and he was monitored for seizures and myocarditis.

active_smoker_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic periodontitis
  presenting_complaint: Bleeding gums and loosening of several lower incisors
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male active smoker presented to the dental clinic with deep periodontal pockets and significant alveolar bone loss. Despite regular scaling, his disease has progressed rapidly. He was informed that smoking masks gingival bleeding due to vasoconstriction and impairs the immune response to oral pathogens, leading to premature tooth loss.

active_smoker_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm
  presenting_complaint: Sudden collapse and severe back pain
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male active smoker was brought in by ambulance in haemorrhagic shock. Emergency CT angiography confirmed a 7.5cm ruptured AAA. He underwent urgent endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR); his 50-year smoking history was identified as the strongest modifiable risk factor for the expansion and eventual rupture of the aneurysm.

active_smoker_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute epiglottitis
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive sore throat, drooling, and stridor
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male active smoker and frequent vaper presented with "tripod" positioning and inability to swallow secretions. Lateral neck X-ray showed the "thumbprint sign." He was managed in the ICU for airway protection and treated with IV ceftriaxone and dexamethasone, with smoking-induced mucosal irritation suspected as a contributing factor.

active_smoker_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Laryngeal carcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Hoarseness of voice persisting for over six weeks
  summary_of_course: A 76-year-old male, a long-term active smoker, was referred via the two-week wait pathway. Laryngoscopy revealed a fungating lesion on the left vocal cord. Biopsy confirmed squamous cell carcinoma; he is currently undergoing workup for a total laryngectomy and has been referred to the hospital's tobacco dependency team.

active_smoker_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Non-healing venous leg ulcer
  presenting_complaint: Chronic painful ulcer over the medial malleolus
  summary_of_course: A 53-year-old female active smoker with chronic venous insufficiency has an ulcer that has failed to heal despite 12 weeks of four-layer compression bandaging. Vascular assessment suggests that continued smoking is causing systemic vasoconstriction and impairing microcirculatory flow at the ulcer bed. She has been offered a trial of nicotine patches to facilitate healing.

active_smoker_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic bronchitis
  presenting_complaint: Productive cough for at least three months in two consecutive years
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male active smoker (25/day) presented to his GP with a "smoker's cough" and daily mucoid sputum production. Spirometry showed an FEV1/FVC ratio of 0.72, not yet meeting the criteria for COPD, but confirming chronic bronchitis. He was advised on the high risk of progression to irreversible airflow obstruction if he continues to smoke.
