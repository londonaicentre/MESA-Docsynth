polyarteritis_nodosa_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Classic Polyarteritis Nodosa
  presenting_complaint: Persistent fever, weight loss, and severe myalgia in the lower limbs.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male presented with a 3-month history of systemic symptoms and new-onset hypertension (175/105 mmHg). Investigations revealed a high ESR (95 mm/hr), ANCA-negative serology, and Hepatitis B surface antigen positivity. Mesenteric angiography demonstrated multiple microaneurysms, confirming PAN; he was treated with high-dose prednisolone, cyclophosphamide, and antiviral therapy with good clinical response.

polyarteritis_nodosa_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Cutaneous Polyarteritis Nodosa
  presenting_complaint: Painful subcutaneous nodules and livedo reticularis on both shins.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female presented to dermatology with tender, erythematous nodules and a reticular purple rash on her legs. Skin punch biopsy showed necrotising vasculitis of the medium-sized arteries in the deep dermis, without systemic involvement or organ dysfunction. She was managed successfully in the outpatient clinic with oral dapsone and a tapering course of moderate-dose corticosteroids.

polyarteritis_nodosa_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Polyarteritis Nodosa with Mesenteric Ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Severe post-prandial abdominal pain and 10kg weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male with a history of smoking presented with "abdominal angina" and bloody stools. CT angiography revealed stenoses and small aneurysms of the superior mesenteric artery branches. Following an emergency laparotomy for a segment of ischaemic bowel, histopathology confirmed transmural necrotising vasculitis, and he was commenced on IV methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide in the ICU.

polyarteritis_nodosa_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Polyarteritis Nodosa presenting as Mononeuritis Multiplex
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of right foot drop and tingling in the left hand.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female presented with asymmetrical neurological deficits and severe calf pain. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies confirmed a multifocal axonal neuropathy (mononeuritis multiplex). A sural nerve biopsy demonstrated fibrinoid necrosis of the arterial wall, leading to a diagnosis of PAN, which was treated with IV corticosteroids and azathioprine.

polyarteritis_nodosa_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Deficiency of Adenosine Deaminase 2 (DADA2)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent lacunar strokes and livedo racemosa since childhood.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old boy with a history of early-onset strokes and persistent skin mottling was referred for genetic testing. Results confirmed biallelic mutations in the ADA2 gene, a known cause of a PAN-like vasculitis syndrome. He was started on TNF-alpha inhibitors (etanercept), which significantly reduced his inflammatory markers and prevented further neurological events.

polyarteritis_nodosa_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Polyarteritis Nodosa with Renal Infarction
  presenting_complaint: Acute left-sided flank pain and gross haematuria.
  summary_of_course: A 47-year-old male presented to A&E with suspected renal colic, but CT showed multiple wedge-shaped renal infarcts and no calculi. Despite the haematuria, there was no evidence of glomerulonephritis on biopsy, but renal angiography showed "string of beads" appearance of the interlobar arteries. He was diagnosed with PAN and started on aggressive immunosuppression and antihypertensive therapy.

polyarteritis_nodosa_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Polyarteritis Nodosa presenting with Orchitis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, painful swelling of the right testicle and high fever.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male was initially treated for epididymo-orchitis with antibiotics but failed to improve. Further review noted systemic symptoms, including night sweats and a new livedoid rash on his trunk. Testicular biopsy performed due to suspected malignancy instead revealed necrotising vasculitis of medium-sized vessels, leading to a diagnosis of PAN and initiation of steroid therapy.

polyarteritis_nodosa_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Systemic Polyarteritis Nodosa
  presenting_complaint: Multi-organ failure, including acute kidney injury and cardiac failure.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male was admitted to the ICU with rapidly progressive renal failure, heart failure, and digital gangrene. Investigations showed a normocytic anaemia, high CRP (210 mg/L), and negative ANCA/ANA. Despite intensive therapy with plasma exchange and pulsed methylprednisolone, the patient succumbed to a massive gastrointestinal haemorrhage from a ruptured visceral aneurysm.

polyarteritis_nodosa_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Polyarteritis Nodosa with Coronary Artery Aneurysms
  presenting_complaint: Acute substernal chest pain and shortness of breath.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with no cardiovascular risk factors presented with an NSTEMI. Coronary angiography showed normal lumina but multiple small aneurysms in the distal coronary tree, and subsequent CT showed similar findings in the hepatic arteries. She was diagnosed with PAN and treated with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, with regular cardiac monitoring.

polyarteritis_nodosa_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Relapsing Polyarteritis Nodosa
  presenting_complaint: Recurrence of skin ulcers and new-onset weakness in the left wrist.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female, previously in remission for 8 years, presented with a flare of her PAN symptoms. Clinical examination revealed new necrotic ulcers on her malleoli and a clinical wrist drop. Her ESR was elevated at 88 mm/hr, and she was restarted on high-dose steroids and mycophenolate mofetil as a steroid-sparing agent due to previous cyclophosphamide toxicity.

polyarteritis_nodosa_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Polyarteritis Nodosa (Diagnostic Challenge)
  presenting_complaint: Unexplained weight loss, night sweats, and raised inflammatory markers.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male underwent extensive investigations for suspected lymphoma, including PET-CT which showed diffuse uptake in the lower limb musculature. A targeted muscle biopsy of the gastrocnemius revealed classic medium-vessel necrotising vasculitis. He was diagnosed with PAN and showed a dramatic clinical improvement within 48 hours of starting prednisolone.

polyarteritis_nodosa_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Polyarteritis Nodosa with CNS Involvement
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, seizures, and focal neurological deficits.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male presented with acute encephalopathy and a right-sided hemiparesis. MRI brain showed multiple small ischaemic areas in different vascular territories, and cerebral angiography revealed focal arterial narrowings. Systemic workup identified livedo reticularis and renal artery aneurysms, confirming PAN with rare CNS involvement; he was treated with IV cyclophosphamide and high-dose steroids.

polyarteritis_nodosa_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Polyarteritis Nodosa following Hepatitis B Infection
  presenting_complaint: Generalised malaise, arthralgia, and new-onset hypertension.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male with known chronic Hepatitis B (HBeAg positive) developed systemic vasculitic symptoms. Bloods showed active viral replication and a rising creatinine level. Diagnosis of HBV-associated PAN was made via skin biopsy of a livedoid area; treatment involved a combination of plasma exchange, short-course steroids, and intensive antiviral therapy with entecavir.

polyarteritis_nodosa_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Polyarteritis Nodosa
  presenting_complaint: Persistent skin ulceration and worsening peripheral neuropathy despite treatment.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female with biopsy-proven PAN failed to achieve remission after 6 months of oral cyclophosphamide and prednisolone. Her symptoms progressed to involve digital ischaemia and worsening mononeuritis multiplex. She was switched to rituximab therapy (off-label) and showed significant healing of skin lesions and stabilisation of neurological symptoms over the following 3 months.

polyarteritis_nodosa_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Polyarteritis Nodosa (Classic)
  presenting_complaint: High fever, joint pain, and tender nodules on the palms and soles.
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old girl presented with features mimicking Kawasaki disease but with more prolonged symptoms and no coronary ectasia on echocardiography. Biopsy of a palmar nodule showed necrotising vasculitis of the medium arteries, and genetic testing for DADA2 was negative. She was diagnosed with paediatric PAN and responded well to IVIG and corticosteroids.

polyarteritis_nodosa_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Polyarteritis Nodosa presenting as Cholecystitis
  presenting_complaint: Right upper quadrant pain, nausea, and vomiting.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for presumed calculous cholecystitis. Histopathology of the gallbladder unexpectedly showed necrotising vasculitis of the medium-sized arteries within the gallbladder wall. Post-operative systemic screening revealed occult renal artery aneurysms, leading to a systemic PAN diagnosis and initiation of immunosuppression.

polyarteritis_nodosa_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Polyarteritis Nodosa
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent calf pain and episodic livedo reticularis.
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old female presented with exercise-induced calf pain and transient skin mottling. Investigations showed a mildly raised ESR (35 mm/hr) and normal renal function. A deep skin and muscle biopsy confirmed early-stage PAN; given the lack of major organ involvement, she was managed conservatively with low-dose prednisolone and methotrexate, achieving good symptom control.

polyarteritis_nodosa_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Polyarteritis Nodosa with Digital Gangrene
  presenting_complaint: Blackening of the tips of the second and third fingers on the left hand.
  summary_of_course: A 49-year-old male presented with acute digital ischaemia and severe pain. Angiography of the upper limb showed abrupt cut-offs of the digital arteries and small aneurysms of the ulnar artery. He was diagnosed with PAN and treated with IV iloprost infusions, high-dose steroids, and cyclophosphamide to prevent further tissue loss.

polyarteritis_nodosa_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Polyarteritis Nodosa in an Elderly Patient
  presenting_complaint: Progressive weakness, anaemia, and loss of appetite.
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old female was admitted for investigation of "failure to thrive." Initial concerns for malignancy were dismissed after a CT scan showed multiple visceral artery microaneurysms. Despite her age and comorbidities (atrial fibrillation and CKD stage 3), she was cautiously treated with a modified regimen of prednisolone and azathioprine, resulting in a slow but steady improvement in her functional status.

polyarteritis_nodosa_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Polyarteritis Nodosa with Pulmonary Sparing
  presenting_complaint: Dyspnoea and haemoptysis (initially suspected, later ruled out).
  summary_of_course: A 53-year-old male presented with systemic illness and respiratory distress. While initial suspicion was Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis, CT chest was clear of nodules or haemorrhage, and ANCA was negative. Further investigation revealed the symptoms were due to cardiac failure from PAN-related coronary vasculitis and renal hypertension; the absence of primary lung involvement helped differentiate PAN from other small-vessel vasculitides.
