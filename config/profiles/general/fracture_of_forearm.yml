She underwent manipulation under anaesthesia (MUA) and K-wire fixation due to instability, followed by a six-week period of immobilisation.

fracture_of_forearm_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Open both-bone forearm fracture (Gustilo-Anderson II)
  presenting_complaint: Deformity, bleeding, and protruding bone in the right forearm following a motorcycle accident.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male sustained high-energy trauma resulting in displaced fractures of both the radial and ulnar shafts with a 3cm skin laceration. He received IV co-amoxiclav and urgent surgical debridement. Definitive management involved open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with dual plating, followed by intensive physiotherapy.

fracture_of_forearm_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Monteggia fracture-dislocation
  presenting_complaint: Elbow pain and inability to rotate the forearm after a fall from a height.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male presented with a proximal third ulnar shaft fracture associated with anterior dislocation of the radial head. The injury was initially misdiagnosed as an isolated ulnar fracture in the community. Specialist orthopaedic review identified the dislocation, necessitating ORIF of the ulna to achieve indirect reduction of the radial head.

fracture_of_forearm_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Galeazzi fracture-dislocation
  presenting_complaint: Wrist pain and prominence of the distal ulna after a direct blow to the forearm.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female presented with a distal third radial shaft fracture and disruption of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ). Radiographs confirmed the injury, and she underwent urgent ORIF of the radius with a compression plate. The DRUJ was found to be stable post-fixation, and she was managed in a sugar-tong splint for two weeks.

fracture_of_forearm_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute compartment syndrome secondary to forearm fracture
  presenting_complaint: Escalating, "out of proportion" pain and paraesthesia in the hand following a crush injury.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male sustained closed mid-shaft fractures of the radius and ulna. Despite immobilisation, he developed tense swelling, pain on passive finger extension, and sensory loss. Emergency four-compartment fasciotomy was performed alongside internal fixation; the wounds were closed by delayed primary intention after five days.

fracture_of_forearm_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Non-union of ulnar shaft fracture
  presenting_complaint: Persistent aching and "clicking" sensation in the forearm six months after the initial injury.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old heavy smoker had previously been managed conservatively for a minimally displaced nightstick fracture. Follow-up imaging showed a persistent fracture gap and sclerotic bone ends consistent with atrophic non-union. He underwent revision surgery involving bone grafting (iliac crest autograft) and plate fixation.

  primary_diagnosis: Pathological fracture of the radius
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of forearm pain while lifting a kettle, with no significant trauma.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer presented with a transverse radial shaft fracture. X-rays revealed a lytic lesion at the fracture site. He was managed with an intramedullary nail for stabilisation and referred for palliative radiotherapy to the forearm.

fracture_of_forearm_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Smith's fracture
  presenting_complaint: Painful, swollen wrist with volar (palmar) displacement after falling onto a flexed hand.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male presented to the ED with a "reverse Colles" deformity. Imaging confirmed a distal radius fracture with volar displacement of the distal fragment. Due to the inherent instability of Smith's fractures, he underwent ORIF with a volar locking plate, achieving good functional recovery.

fracture_of_forearm_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Buckle (Torus) fracture of the distal radius
  presenting_complaint: Mild wrist pain and reluctance to use the arm after a fall at nursery.
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old girl presented with focal tenderness over the distal radius but no gross deformity. Radiographs showed a subtle cortical bulge (buckle) of the distal radius. In accordance with NICE guidelines, she was treated with a removable Velcro splint for three weeks with no follow-up imaging required.

fracture_of_forearm_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Isolated ulnar shaft fracture (Nightstick fracture)
  presenting_complaint: Localised pain and bruising over the outer forearm after shielding the head during an assault.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male sustained a direct blow to the mid-forearm. X-rays showed an isolated, non-displaced fracture of the ulnar shaft. As the interosseous membrane was intact and displacement was less than 50%, he was managed successfully with a functional brace and early range-of-motion exercises.

fracture_of_forearm_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Salter-Harris Type II distal radius fracture
  presenting_complaint: Pain and swelling at the growth plate following a fall during a football match.
  summary_of_course: A 13-year-old male presented with a fracture extending through the physeal plate and exiting through the metaphysis. Closed reduction was performed under sedation in A&E to restore alignment. He remained in a long-arm cast for four weeks, with subsequent monitoring to ensure no premature physeal closure or growth arrest.

  primary_diagnosis: Malunion of the radius and ulna
  presenting_complaint: Significant loss of forearm rotation and visible deformity one year after a fracture.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female had previously declined surgery for displaced mid-shaft fractures. The fractures healed with significant angulation and synostosis, limiting pronation and supination to 10 degrees. She elected for corrective osteotomy and internal fixation to improve functional range of motion.

fracture_of_forearm_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Infected non-union of the forearm (Osteomyelitis)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic discharge from a surgical scar and persistent forearm pain.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old intravenous drug user presented four months after ORIF for an open forearm fracture. Clinical examination revealed a sinus tract and exposed hardware. Management involved hardware removal, aggressive debridement of necrotic bone, placement of antibiotic-loaded cement beads, and a long course of targeted IV antibiotics.

fracture_of_forearm_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Stress fracture of the radius
  presenting_complaint: Insidious onset of dull forearm pain exacerbated by weight-bearing activities.
  summary_of_course: An 18-year-old elite gymnast presented with three months of worsening pain. Initial X-rays were normal, but an MRI revealed periosteal oedema and a hairline fracture line in the distal radial diaphysis. She was treated with activity modification and a period of non-weight bearing, leading to full resolution of symptoms.

fracture_of_forearm_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Forearm fracture with associated radial nerve palsy
  presenting_complaint: Inability to extend the wrist or fingers following a mid-shaft radial fracture.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male sustained a displaced mid-shaft radial fracture in a crush injury. Neurological exam revealed a "wrist drop" consistent with radial nerve involvement. During ORIF, the nerve was found to be neuropraxic (entrapped but intact); full neurological recovery occurred spontaneously over the following four months.

fracture_of_forearm_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Distal radius fracture in a patient with dementia
  presenting_complaint: Bruising and reluctance to move the left arm noted by care home staff.
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old male with advanced Alzheimer's disease fell in his room. Imaging showed a minimally displaced distal radius fracture. Given his frailty and poor compliance with rehabilitation, he was managed conservatively with a lightweight soft cast and prioritised for comfort and nursing care.

fracture_of_forearm_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Segmental fracture of the radius and ulna
  presenting_complaint: Extreme pain and gross instability of the forearm after a high-speed RTA.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female sustained fractures at two different levels in both the radius and ulna. She was initially stabilised in an external fixator due to soft tissue swelling and polytrauma. Once the "second hit" window passed, the external fixator was converted to definitive internal fixation with long plates.

fracture_of_forearm_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Chauffeur's fracture (Radial styloid fracture)
  presenting_complaint: Pain on the lateral aspect of the wrist after a sudden impact.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male sustained an intra-articular fracture of the radial styloid. The injury was caused by a direct blow to the wrist. Because the fracture involved the attachment of the radiocarpal ligaments, it was treated with percutaneous cannulated screw fixation to ensure carpal stability.
