  primary_diagnosis: Perforated peptic ulcer
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset generalised abdominal pain and rigidity
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old female with a history of long-term NSAID use for osteoarthritis presented with sudden, "tearing" epigastric pain. On examination, she demonstrated "board-like" abdominal rigidity, absent bowel sounds, and signs of systemic shock. Erect chest X-ray showed free air under the diaphragm, and she underwent emergency laparotomy for an omental patch repair.

acute_abdomen_on_examination_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric intussusception
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent colicky crying and "redcurrant jelly" stools
  summary_of_course: A 10-month-old male infant presented with episodes of inconsolable crying and drawing legs up to the chest. Physical examination revealed a palpable "sausage-shaped" mass in the right upper quadrant and an empty right iliac fossa (Sign of Dance). Ultrasound confirmed the "target sign" of ileocolic intussusception, which was successfully reduced via air insufflation enema.

acute_abdomen_on_examination_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute mesenteric ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal pain out of proportion to clinical findings
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with atrial fibrillation presented with sudden, agonising generalised abdominal pain. Despite the severity of symptoms, initial examination showed a soft, non-distended abdomen with minimal tenderness. However, metabolic acidosis with a high lactate (6.2 mmol/L) and subsequent CT angiography revealed an embolus in the superior mesenteric artery requiring urgent embolectomy.

acute_abdomen_on_examination_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Ruptured ectopic pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Severe lower abdominal pain and syncopal episode
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female presented to A&E after collapsing at home following acute left-sided pelvic pain.

  primary_diagnosis: Acute cholecystitis
  presenting_complaint: Right upper quadrant pain and fever
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with a high BMI presented with persistent RUQ pain radiating to the right scapula. On examination, she was febrile (38.4°C) and demonstrated a positive Murphy’s sign (inspiratory arrest on deep palpation of the RUQ). Ultrasound showed gallbladder wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid, and she was managed with intravenous antibiotics and a planned cholecystectomy.

acute_abdomen_on_examination_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute necrotising pancreatitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe epigastric pain radiating to the back
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male with a history of heavy alcohol intake presented with severe epigastric pain and repeated vomiting. Examination revealed periumbilical ecchymosis (Cullen's sign) and flank bruising (Grey Turner's sign), indicating retroperitoneal haemorrhage. Serum amylase was >1500 U/L, and he was admitted to the ICU for aggressive fluid resuscitation and management of multi-organ failure.

He was transferred immediately to the operating theatre for an emergency endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) without waiting for further imaging.

acute_abdomen_on_examination_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Small bowel obstruction due to adhesions
  presenting_complaint: Colicky pain, vomiting, and abdominal distension
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female with a history of three previous laparotomies presented with progressive nausea and feculent vomiting. Examination showed a distended abdomen with visible peristalsis and multiple surgical scars, but no evidence of incarcerated hernias. CT scan confirmed a transition point in the distal ileum due to adhesions, which resolved with conservative management (drip and suck).

acute_abdomen_on_examination_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute diverticulitis with paracolic abscess
  presenting_complaint: Left iliac fossa pain and altered bowel habit
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male presented with a 4-day history of worsening LLQ pain and low-grade fever. Examination revealed localized tenderness and a palpable, tender mass in the left iliac fossa. CT scan demonstrated sigmoid diverticulitis with a 4cm paracolic abscess (Hinchey Stage Ib), which was successfully treated with CT-guided percutaneous drainage and antibiotics.

acute_abdomen_on_examination_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral lower abdominal pain and vaginal discharge
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female presented with subacute bilateral pelvic pain and dyspareunia. Examination showed bilateral adnexal tenderness and significant cervical motion tenderness ("chandelier sign") on bimanual examination.

acute_abdomen_on_examination_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP)
  presenting_complaint: Diffuse abdominal pain and worsening confusion
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with known alcoholic cirrhosis and ascites presented with mild diffuse abdominal discomfort and Grade 2 encephalopathy. Examination showed shifting dullness and mild generalised tenderness without guarding. Diagnostic paracentesis revealed an ascitic neutrophil count of 450 cells/mm³, confirming SBP, which was treated with intravenous cefotaxime and albumin.

acute_abdomen_on_examination_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Mesenteric adenitis
  presenting_complaint: Right-sided abdominal pain and recent sore throat
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old female presented with a 2-day history of RIF pain following an upper respiratory tract infection. On examination, she had cervical lymphadenopathy and RIF tenderness, but notably, the tenderness was shifting when she moved from her back to her left side. Observation and serial examinations showed spontaneous resolution, and the diagnosis was confirmed as mesenteric adenitis.

acute_abdomen_on_examination_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Ischaemic colitis
  presenting_complaint: Left-sided abdominal pain followed by bloody diarrhoea
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with peripheral vascular disease presented with sudden LLQ cramping followed by several episodes of bright red rectal bleeding. Examination revealed moderate LLQ tenderness but no signs of peritonitis. Flexible sigmoidoscopy showed "thumbprinting" and dusky mucosa at the splenic flexure, and the condition resolved with supportive care and bowel rest.

acute_abdomen_on_examination_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Ovarian torsion
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset unilateral pelvic pain and nausea
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female presented with sudden, severe, colicky right-sided pelvic pain that started during exercise. Examination revealed a very tender right adnexal mass and localized guarding. Doppler ultrasound showed absent blood flow to the right ovary, and emergency laparoscopy confirmed a 720-degree torsion of a dermoid cyst, requiring detorsion and cystectomy.

acute_abdomen_on_examination_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Strangulated inguinal hernia
  presenting_complaint: Painful, irreducible groin swelling and vomiting
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male presented with a 6-hour history of an exquisitely painful lump in his right groin. Examination revealed an irreducible, tense, and erythematous indirect inguinal hernia with no cough impulse. He was tachycardic and had generalised abdominal distension, necessitating urgent surgical exploration and bowel resection for ischaemic ileum.

acute_abdomen_on_examination_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Sharp right upper quadrant pain and pleuritic chest pain
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old female presented with sharp RUQ pain that worsened with deep inspiration, mimicking cholecystitis. However, Murphy's sign was negative, and she reported a recent history of pelvic discomfort. Laparoscopy revealed "violin-string" adhesions between the liver capsule and the anterior abdominal wall, secondary to a previous pelvic infection.

acute_abdomen_on_examination_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Perforated diverticulitis with faecal peritonitis
  presenting_complaint: Generalised abdominal pain and septic shock
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female presented with a 24-hour history of LLQ pain that suddenly became generalised. On examination, she was moribund, with a rigid abdomen, cold peripheries, and a BP of 70/40 mmHg. Emergency laparotomy revealed a perforated sigmoid colon with gross faecal contamination (Hinchey Stage IV), requiring a Hartmann's procedure.
