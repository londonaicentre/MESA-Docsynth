primary_cancer_skin_melanoma_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Superficial spreading melanoma
  presenting_complaint: Changing mole on the upper back with irregular borders and itching.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented with a 7mm pigmented lesion on her back that had recently darkened. Dermoscopy revealed an atypical network and regression structures; a 2mm punch biopsy confirmed superficial spreading melanoma, Breslow thickness 0.8mm. She underwent a wide local excision (WLE) with 1cm margins and remains under dermatological surveillance with no recurrence at 2 years.

primary_cancer_skin_melanoma_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Nodular melanoma
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly growing, bleeding lump on the scalp.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male presented with a 1cm vascular, ulcerated nodule on the vertex of his scalp that developed over three months. Excisional biopsy confirmed nodular melanoma with a Breslow thickness of 4.5mm and ulceration (pT4b). Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was positive for micrometastases, and he was commenced on adjuvant Nivolumab therapy following a completion lymphadenectomy.

primary_cancer_skin_melanoma_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Lentigo maligna melanoma
  presenting_complaint: Slowly enlarging, variegated brown patch on the left cheek.
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old female with extensive solar elastosis presented with a 3cm irregular macule on her face present for several years. Recent focal thickening prompted a biopsy which showed lentigo maligna melanoma, Breslow thickness 0.5mm. Due to her age and the lesion's location, she was treated with staged excision (MOHS-micrographic surgery) to ensure clear margins while preserving tissue.

primary_cancer_skin_melanoma_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Acral lentiginous melanoma
  presenting_complaint: Persistent dark streak under the right thumbnail.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male of Afro-Caribbean descent presented with a 4mm wide longitudinal melanonychia that had expanded into the proximal nail fold (Hutchinson's sign). Initial management for suspected subungual haematoma failed to resolve the lesion; biopsy confirmed acral lentiginous melanoma. He underwent a distal interphalangeal joint amputation and is currently undergoing staging CT scans.

primary_cancer_skin_melanoma_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Amelanotic melanoma
  presenting_complaint: Non-pigmented, pinkish papule on the right thigh.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female presented with a "persistent insect bite" that failed to heal over six months. The lesion was a symmetric, pink 5mm papule lacking typical pigmentary markers, leading to a delayed diagnosis. Histopathology following excision revealed an amelanotic melanoma, Breslow 1.2mm, BRAF V600E mutation positive; she is now being monitored for regional lymphadenopathy.

primary_cancer_skin_melanoma_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Metastatic melanoma with unknown primary
  presenting_complaint: Enlarged, painless lump in the left axilla.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male presented with a 4cm firm mass in the left axillary vault but no suspicious cutaneous lesions on full-body examination. Fine needle aspiration and subsequent core biopsy confirmed metastatic melanoma. PET-CT identified no primary site, leading to a diagnosis of occult primary melanoma Stage III; he underwent axillary lymph node dissection followed by adjuvant Pembrolizumab.

primary_cancer_skin_melanoma_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Desmoplastic melanoma
  presenting_complaint: Firm, scar-like plaque on the back of the neck.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male presented with what appeared to be a hypertrophic scar in an area of previous sun damage. Biopsy revealed desmoplastic melanoma, a rare variant characterised by dense collagen and spindle cells, with a Breslow thickness of 3.5mm. Given the high risk of local recurrence, he received WLE with 2cm margins and adjuvant radiotherapy to the primary site.

primary_cancer_skin_melanoma_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Spitzoid melanoma
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly growing red nodule on the forearm of a 10-year-old.
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old girl presented with a 6mm amelanotic, dome-shaped nodule. Histology showed a Spitzoid neoplasm with high mitotic activity and cytological atypia, concerning for Spitzoid melanoma. Following MDT discussion, a WLE was performed; molecular testing showed an ALK fusion, and the patient remains in clinical remission under specialist paediatric oncology-dermatology follow-up.

primary_cancer_skin_melanoma_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Melanoma in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly darkening mole on the abdomen during the second trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old pregnant female (24 weeks gestation) noted significant changes in a pre-existing naevus on her abdomen. Excision under local anaesthetic confirmed a 1.1mm Breslow melanoma. Management was coordinated between dermatology and obstetrics, opting for WLE and delaying SLNB until postpartum to avoid lymphoscintigraphy during pregnancy.

primary_cancer_skin_melanoma_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Stage IV Melanoma with brain metastases
  presenting_complaint: New onset seizures and severe headache.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with a history of a 2.0mm melanoma excised three years prior presented acutely to the A&E. MRI brain revealed multiple haemorrhagic metastases, and CT chest/abdomen showed widespread visceral involvement. He was started on high-dose dexamethasone and referred for urgent stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and dual immunotherapy with Ipilimumab and Nivolumab.

primary_cancer_skin_melanoma_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent melanoma (In-transit metastases)
  presenting_complaint: Multiple small blue-black nodules appearing near a previous surgical scar on the leg.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female, previously treated for a Stage IIb melanoma on her left calf, presented with five new satellite lesions within 5cm of the WLE scar. Clinical staging confirmed in-transit metastases without evidence of distant spread. She was treated with intralesional T-VEC (Talimogene laherparepvec) injections, resulting in partial regression of the nodules.

primary_cancer_skin_melanoma_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Melanoma in situ
  presenting_complaint: Large, irregular tan-coloured patch on the shoulder.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male presented with a 1.5cm "ugly duckling" lesion on his right deltoid. Excisional biopsy confirmed melanoma in situ (Stage 0), where malignant cells were confined to the epidermis. He underwent a WLE with 5mm margins, and no further systemic treatment was required, though he remains on 6-monthly skin checks.

primary_cancer_skin_melanoma_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Melanoma arising in a giant congenital melanocytic naevus
  presenting_complaint: New palpable lump within a large birthmark on the trunk.
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old boy with a giant congenital melanocytic naevus (GCMN) covering 20% of his body surface area developed a firm deep nodule. Biopsy confirmed a primary melanoma arising within the deep dermal component of the naevus. Despite aggressive surgical resection, the patient developed early pulmonary metastases and was commenced on targeted therapy.

primary_cancer_skin_melanoma_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Melanoma with bowel metastasis
  presenting_complaint: Acute abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male with a previous history of trunk melanoma presented with signs of small bowel obstruction. Emergency laparotomy revealed an intussusception caused by a metastatic melanoma deposit in the jejunum. Following bowel resection, he was staged as Stage IV and commenced on systemic immunotherapy.

primary_cancer_skin_melanoma_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Melanoma in an immunosuppressed patient
  presenting_complaint: Multiple rapidly evolving pigmented lesions on the limbs.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male renal transplant recipient on long-term Ciclosporin presented with two separate primary melanomas (Breslow 0.9mm and 1.4mm) on his arms. Immunosuppression was adjusted to a Sirolimus-based regimen to reduce the pro-oncogenic effect. He requires intensive 3-monthly total body photography due to his significantly elevated risk of further primary tumours.

primary_cancer_skin_melanoma_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Advanced melanoma with immune-related colitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe bloody diarrhoea and abdominal cramping.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female undergoing Ipilimumab/Nivolumab for Stage IV melanoma presented with Grade 3 colitis. She was admitted for intravenous methylprednisolone and fluid resuscitation; her melanoma had shown a partial response on recent imaging. Due to the severity of the immune-related adverse event (irAE), immunotherapy was held and she eventually required Infliximab to resolve the symptoms.

primary_cancer_skin_melanoma_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Palliative-stage fungating melanoma
  presenting_complaint: Large, malodorous, bleeding mass in the left groin.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male presented with a neglected 10cm fungating mass in the inguinal region, fixed to underlying structures. Biopsy confirmed melanoma, but the patient declined systemic therapy due to frailty and multiple comorbidities. Management focused on palliative radiotherapy for local control and community nursing for wound care and odour management.

primary_cancer_skin_melanoma_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Melanoma of the external ear
  presenting_complaint: Ulcerated lesion on the helix of the left ear.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old male presented with a 1cm ulcerated nodule on the ear cartilage. Histology showed a 2.2mm Breslow melanoma with cartilage invasion. He underwent a wedge resection of the ear and a sentinel lymph node biopsy of the parotid and cervical nodes, which were fortunately negative.

primary_cancer_skin_melanoma_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Acral melanoma with lymphoedema
  presenting_complaint: Swelling of the entire right leg following melanoma surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female underwent a radical inguinal lymph node dissection for Stage III acral melanoma of the foot. Post-operatively, she developed chronic Grade 2 lymphoedema of the right lower limb. She is now managed with compression garments and manual lymphatic drainage while remaining in remission from her primary cancer.

primary_cancer_skin_melanoma_020:
  primary_diagnosis: BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss, night sweats, and multiple subcutaneous lumps.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male presented with systemic symptoms and palpable nodules on his chest wall. Biopsy of a nodule confirmed metastatic melanoma, and molecular profiling identified a BRAF V600E mutation. He was started on Dabrafenib and Trametinib (dual BRAF/MEK inhibition), showing a rapid symptomatic improvement and significant reduction in tumour burden within four weeks.
