muscle_wasting_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Sarcopenia
  presenting_complaint: Progressive frailty, frequent falls, and difficulty rising from a chair.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female presented with a one-year history of reduced mobility and three falls in the last month. Clinical assessment and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) confirmed low skeletal muscle mass and reduced grip strength. She was started on a high-protein diet and a supervised resistance exercise programme, resulting in improved gait speed at six-month follow-up.

muscle_wasting_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
  presenting_complaint: Delayed walking and a positive Gowers' sign.
  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old male exhibited significant proximal muscle weakness and pseudohypertrophy of the calves. Genetic testing confirmed a deletion in the DMD gene, and creatine kinase (CK) levels were markedly elevated at 15,000 U/L. He was commenced on daily prednisolone and referred to a multidisciplinary paediatric neuromuscular team for long-term management.

muscle_wasting_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
  presenting_complaint: Fasciculations, slurred speech, and wasting of the small muscles of the hand.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male presented with subacute onset of "split hand" deformity and progressive dysarthria. Electromyography (EMG) demonstrated widespread denervation and reinnervation changes across multiple segments. He was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease (ALS subtype) and initiated on Riluzole, with subsequent referral for non-invasive ventilation (NIV) assessment.

muscle_wasting_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Cancer Cachexia
  presenting_complaint: Profound weight loss and loss of muscle bulk despite adequate intake.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) presented with a 15% body weight loss over three months. Examination revealed prominent temporal wasting and reduced mid-arm muscle circumference. Despite nutritional supplementation and progestogens, his muscle wasting progressed in tandem with his malignancy, requiring palliative care involvement.

muscle_wasting_005:
  primary_diagnosis: ICU-Acquired Weakness
  presenting_complaint: Failure to wean from mechanical ventilation and global flaccid paralysis.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female spent 24 days in the ICU for septic shock and multi-organ failure. Following sedation withdrawal, she exhibited profound symmetrical limb weakness and muscle atrophy. Nerve conduction studies confirmed critical illness polyneuromyopathy; she required intensive long-term inpatient rehabilitation to regain basic motor function.

muscle_wasting_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 1
  presenting_complaint: Severe hypotonia and "floppy baby" presentation.
  summary_of_course: A 4-month-old infant presented with a lack of head control and intercostal recession during breathing. Clinical examination showed absent deep tendon reflexes and tongue fasciculations. Genetic testing revealed homozygous deletion of SMN1; the patient was urgently commenced on Nusinersen therapy to prevent further motor neurone loss.

  primary_diagnosis: Uraemic Sarcopenia
  presenting_complaint: Generalised weakness and loss of muscle mass in the setting of chronic kidney disease.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female with Stage 5 CKD on maintenance haemodialysis reported progressive difficulty with activities of daily living. Investigations showed persistent metabolic acidosis and chronic inflammation (elevated CRP). Despite dialysis optimisation and intradialytic parenteral nutrition, muscle wasting remained a significant challenge to her quality of life.

muscle_wasting_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Thyrotoxic Myopathy
  presenting_complaint: Proximal muscle weakness and palpitations.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old female presented with Graves' disease and reported difficulty climbing stairs and combing her hair. Examination showed significant wasting of the shoulder and pelvic girdle muscles with preserved reflexes. Her muscle strength gradually returned to baseline following three months of Carbimazole therapy and achievement of a euthyroid state.

muscle_wasting_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Dermatomyositis
  presenting_complaint: Heliotrope rash and inability to stand from a seated position.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female presented with subacute proximal weakness and a characteristic violaceous rash on her eyelids. Muscle biopsy showed perifascicular atrophy and inflammatory infiltrates. She was treated with high-dose oral prednisolone and Methotrexate, which successfully halted the muscle wasting and improved her CK levels.

muscle_wasting_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Disuse Atrophy
  presenting_complaint: Significant thinning of the right thigh following immobilisation.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male underwent eight weeks of lower limb casting following a complex femoral fracture. Upon cast removal, the quadriceps circumference was 5cm less than the contralateral side. He was prescribed an intensive eight-week physiotherapy programme focusing on hypertrophy-targeted resistance training, leading to full recovery of muscle bulk.

muscle_wasting_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic Amyotrophy
  presenting_complaint: Severe, burning thigh pain followed by rapid wasting of the quadriceps.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes presented with acute-on-chronic unilateral leg weakness. Clinical findings were consistent with Bruns-Garland syndrome, involving the L2-L4 nerve roots. Management focused on strict glycaemic control and neuropathic pain relief, with slow partial recovery of muscle volume over 12 months.

muscle_wasting_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Anorexia Nervosa
  presenting_complaint: Extreme emaciation and secondary amenorrhoea.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female presented with a BMI of 13.5 and global muscle wasting due to restrictive eating. Laboratory tests showed severe electrolyte imbalances and hypoalbuminaemia. She was admitted for medically supervised refeeding and psychiatric intervention, with gradual restoration of muscle mass over a six-month period.

muscle_wasting_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Becker Muscular Dystrophy
  presenting_complaint: Exercise-induced muscle cramps and slow running speed.
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old male presented with calf hypertrophy but noticeable wasting of the quadriceps and hamstrings. Genetic testing identified an in-frame mutation in the dystrophin gene, consistent with a milder phenotype than Duchenne. He remains ambulatory but requires regular cardiac monitoring due to the risk of dilated cardiomyopathy.

muscle_wasting_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM)
  presenting_complaint: Frequent tripping and difficulty gripping objects.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male presented with chronic, asymmetric wasting of the finger flexors and quadriceps. Unlike other myositis types, his condition was refractory to corticosteroid therapy. Muscle biopsy confirmed the presence of rimmed vacuoles and amyloid deposits, and management shifted to supportive care and occupational therapy.

muscle_wasting_015:
  primary_diagnosis: HIV-Associated Wasting Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Unintentional weight loss and chronic diarrhoea.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male with a new diagnosis of HIV (CD4 count <100 cells/mm3) presented with a 12kg weight loss and visible loss of muscle stores. The wasting was attributed to a combination of opportunistic infections and cytokine-mediated catabolism. Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and nutritional support led to a gradual increase in lean body mass.

muscle_wasting_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Cushing's Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Central obesity with spindly arms and legs.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female presented with hypertension, a "buffalo hump," and severe proximal limb wasting. Investigations revealed a pituitary adenoma causing ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism. Following successful transsphenoidal resection of the adenoma, her cortisol levels normalised, and her muscle bulk slowly improved with rehabilitation.

muscle_wasting_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Radial Nerve Atrophy
  presenting_complaint: Wrist drop and thinning of the forearm muscles.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male sustained a mid-shaft humeral fracture in a road traffic accident, resulting in an acute radial nerve palsy. Despite surgical fixation of the bone, the brachioradialis and extensor muscles showed significant neurogenic wasting over three months. Nerve conduction studies showed axonal loss, and he underwent a tendon transfer procedure to restore hand function.

muscle_wasting_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Malabsorption-related Wasting
  presenting_complaint: Steatorrhoea, anaemia, and gluteal wasting.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female presented with chronic fatigue and significant muscle loss in the pelvic girdle. Serology and duodenal biopsy confirmed Coeliac disease (Marsh 3c). After six months on a strict gluten-free diet, her malabsorption resolved, and she regained 8kg of lean mass through improved nutrient uptake.

muscle_wasting_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Alcoholic Myopathy
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty walking and reduced muscle bulk in the lower limbs.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with a 30-year history of heavy alcohol consumption presented with symmetric proximal weakness and calf wasting. Investigations ruled out vitamin deficiencies but showed direct toxic effects on Type II muscle fibres. Total abstinence from alcohol and thiamine supplementation resulted in significant improvement in muscle strength over one year.

muscle_wasting_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Kennedy's Disease
  presenting_complaint: Tremors, muscle cramps, and progressive bulbar weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male presented with perioral fasciculations and wasting of the tongue and limb-girdle muscles. Examination also noted gynaecomastia. Genetic testing confirmed a CAG repeat expansion in the androgen receptor gene (Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy). Management is currently symptomatic, focusing on speech therapy and monitoring for aspiration.
