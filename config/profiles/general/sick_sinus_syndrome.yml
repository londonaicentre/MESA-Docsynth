sick_sinus_syndrome_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent palpitations followed by lightheadedness and near-syncope.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old female presented to the emergency department following a collapse. 24-hour Holter monitoring demonstrated paroxysms of atrial fibrillation followed by prolonged sinus pauses of up to 4.2 seconds upon reversion. She was diagnosed with tachy-brady syndrome and underwent successful implantation of a dual-chamber permanent pacemaker (PPM) with subsequent initiation of anticoagulation.

sick_sinus_syndrome_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-surgical sick sinus syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Profound lethargy and poor feeding in a paediatric patient.
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old male with a history of a Mustard procedure for transposition of the great arteries presented with decreased exercise tolerance. Surface ECG revealed a persistent junctional escape rhythm at 45 bpm with absent P-waves. A diagnosis of iatrogenic sick sinus syndrome due to previous atrial surgery was made, and an epicardial pacing system was electively fitted.

sick_sinus_syndrome_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Drug-induced sinus node dysfunction
  presenting_complaint: Symptomatic bradycardia and shortness of breath on exertion.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male on high-dose Atenolol for hypertension presented with a heart rate of 32 bpm. While initially attributed solely to beta-blockade, the bradycardia persisted (HR 38 bpm) 72 hours after drug cessation, unmasking underlying sick sinus syndrome. He required a permanent pacemaker as symptoms remained limiting despite optimal medical management of his other comorbidities.

sick_sinus_syndrome_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic asymptomatic sinus bradycardia
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of low heart rate during routine health check.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old asymptomatic male was referred from primary care after a routine pulse check found a heart rate of 44 bpm. ECG confirmed sinus bradycardia with normal PR and QT intervals and no evidence of exit block. Given the lack of symptoms (syncope, dizziness, or heart failure), a "watch and wait" approach was adopted with six-monthly clinical reviews in the outpatient cardiology clinic.

sick_sinus_syndrome_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe sick sinus syndrome with sinus arrest
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset syncope without prodrome.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female collapsed while gardening, sustaining a minor head injury. In-hospital telemetry captured a 5.5-second sinus arrest during a symptomatic episode of dizziness. She was diagnosed with severe sick sinus syndrome and underwent urgent dual-chamber pacemaker insertion, with no further syncopal episodes reported at her three-month follow-up.

sick_sinus_syndrome_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Tachy-brady syndrome with thromboembolic stroke
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset right-sided weakness and expressive aphasia.
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old female presented with an ischaemic stroke; telemetry in the hyperacute stroke unit revealed alternating periods of rapid atrial fibrillation and profound sinus bradycardia (30 bpm). The clinical picture was consistent with tachy-brady syndrome leading to a left MCA territory infarct. She was stabilised, anticoagulated with Apixaban, and received a PPM prior to discharge to neuro-rehabilitation.

sick_sinus_syndrome_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Infiltrative sick sinus syndrome due to Sarcoidosis
  presenting_complaint: Progressive dyspnoea and atypical chest pain.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with known systemic sarcoidosis presented with worsening fatigue. Cardiac MRI showed late gadolinium enhancement in the basal septum, and ECG revealed sinus node exit block. He was diagnosed with cardiac sarcoidosis involving the conduction system and was treated with high-dose corticosteroids and a prophylactic ICD due to associated ventricular involvement.

sick_sinus_syndrome_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronotropic incompetence
  presenting_complaint: Significant exercise intolerance and fatigue during hill walking.
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old female fitness enthusiast reported an inability to increase her heart rate during vigorous exercise. Exercise tolerance testing (Bruce protocol) showed a peak heart rate of only 92 bpm despite maximal effort (predicted max 166 bpm). She was diagnosed with chronotropic incompetence, a variant of sick sinus syndrome, and reported a dramatic improvement in exercise capacity following the implantation of a rate-responsive pacemaker.

sick_sinus_syndrome_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute ischaemic sinus node dysfunction
  presenting_complaint: Severe retrosternal chest pain and diaphoresis.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male presented with an acute inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) due to right coronary artery occlusion. Post-primary PCI, he developed transient sinus arrest and junctional bradycardia, likely due to ischaemia of the sinoatrial nodal artery. The arrhythmia resolved spontaneously within 48 hours as myocardial perfusion improved, and no permanent pacing was required.

sick_sinus_syndrome_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary sinus node dysfunction (Hyperkalaemia)
  presenting_complaint: Generalized weakness and nausea in a dialysis patient.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with Stage 5 CKD presented with a potassium level of 6.9 mmol/L. His ECG mimicked sick sinus syndrome with a slow, irregular rhythm and flattened P-waves (sinoventricular conduction). Following urgent treatment with calcium gluconate and insulin-dextrose, his sinus rhythm returned to normal, confirming that the sinus node dysfunction was secondary to metabolic derangement rather than intrinsic disease.

sick_sinus_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Pacemaker lead displacement in SSS
  presenting_complaint: Recurrence of pre-syncopal spells three weeks post-pacemaker insertion.
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old female with known sick sinus syndrome had recently undergone PPM implantation. She presented with a return of her original symptoms; a chest X-ray confirmed displacement of the atrial lead into the right ventricular outflow tract. She underwent successful lead repositioning, after which pacing parameters were restored and symptoms resolved.

sick_sinus_syndrome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Familial sick sinus syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent nocturnal dizziness and family history of sudden death.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male was referred for investigation of nocturnal bradycardia detected by a wearable device. Genetic testing identified a mutation in the SCN5A gene, and prolonged monitoring showed daytime sinus pauses during rest. Given the family history and symptomatic pauses, he was diagnosed with hereditary sick sinus syndrome and received a dual-chamber pacemaker.

sick_sinus_syndrome_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypothyroid-induced sinus node dysfunction
  presenting_complaint: Weight gain, cold intolerance, and a pulse of 36 bpm.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female presented with classic features of myxoedema; biochemistry confirmed severe hypothyroidism (TSH >100 mIU/L, Free T4 undetectable). ECG showed profound sinus bradycardia and low voltage complexes. The sinus node dysfunction was treated as a reversible secondary cause; her heart rate normalised over several weeks of cautious Levothyroxine replacement therapy.

sick_sinus_syndrome_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic SSS following AF ablation
  presenting_complaint: Persistent slow heart rate and dizziness following cardiac ablation.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male underwent extensive radiofrequency ablation for persistent atrial fibrillation. Post-procedure, he failed to maintain a robust sinus rate, exhibiting persistent sinus bradycardia at 35-40 bpm and blunted heart rate response to movement. This was attributed to collateral injury to the sinus node or its blood supply during the procedure, necessitating a permanent pacemaker prior to discharge.

sick_sinus_syndrome_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Sleep apnoea-associated sinus pauses
  presenting_complaint: Excessive daytime somnolence and witnessed apnoeic episodes.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old obese male underwent overnight polysomnography, which revealed severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and concurrent sinus pauses of up to 6 seconds during desaturations. He was initially considered for a pacemaker, but the pauses were completely abolished following successful titration of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy. He remains under cardiology surveillance but currently requires no pacing intervention.

sick_sinus_syndrome_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Cardiac amyloidosis with SSS
  presenting_complaint: Progressive heart failure symptoms and recurrent syncope.
  summary_of_course: An 81-year-old male with biopsy-proven AL amyloidosis presented with decompensated heart failure. ECG showed low voltage QRS complexes and a slow junctional rhythm, with Holter monitoring confirming sick sinus syndrome. His management was complicated by the restrictive cardiomyopathy, and while a pacemaker was implanted for the bradyarrhythmia, his overall prognosis remained poor due to the systemic nature of his amyloid disease.

sick_sinus_syndrome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Lyme carditis presenting as SSS
  presenting_complaint: Fever, rash, and palpitations.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female presented in the summer months with an erythema migrans rash and lightheadedness after a hiking trip. ECG demonstrated fluctuating sinus node exit block and intermittent high-grade AV block. Serology confirmed Borrelia burgdorferi infection; she was treated with a 21-day course of intravenous Ceftriaxone, which led to complete resolution of the conduction abnormalities.

sick_sinus_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Digoxin toxicity mimicking SSS
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, yellow-tinted vision, and vomiting.
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old female on Digoxin for atrial fibrillation presented with a "regularised" pulse of 30 bpm. Serum digoxin levels were toxic at 4.2 ng/mL, and the ECG showed a junctional escape rhythm with characteristic ST-segment "sagging." She was treated with Digoxin-specific antibody fragments (DigiFab) in the ICU, resulting in the return of atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response.

sick_sinus_syndrome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Autonomic dysfunction-associated SSS
  presenting_complaint: Severe orthostatic hypotension and syncope.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male with Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) experienced frequent blackouts. Tilt-table testing induced not only a drop in blood pressure but also a concurrent 4-second sinus arrest, suggesting a component of sick sinus syndrome exacerbated by autonomic failure. A pacemaker was implanted to prevent the cardioinhibitory component of his syncope, though he required ongoing medical management for his vasodepressor symptoms.

sick_sinus_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic senile degeneration of the sinus node
  presenting_complaint: Gradual decline in mobility and "slowing down."
  summary_of_course: A 91-year-old female was admitted from a nursing home with progressive debility. ECG showed persistent sinus bradycardia at 38 bpm without reversible causes or offending medications. Following a multidisciplinary discussion involving the patient and her family, a decision was made to pursue conservative, palliative management rather than invasive pacing, focusing on symptom control and quality of life.
