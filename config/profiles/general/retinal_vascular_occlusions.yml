retinal_vascular_occlusions_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Non-ischaemic Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden painless blurring of vision in the right eye over 24 hours.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with poorly controlled hypertension presented with 6/18 vision and widespread flame-shaped haemorrhages in all four quadrants. Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) confirmed a non-ischaemic CRVO with significant macular oedema on OCT. He commenced a course of intravitreal Aflibercept injections, resulting in vision improvement to 6/9 after three doses.

retinal_vascular_occlusions_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Ischaemic Central Retinal Vein Occlusion
  presenting_complaint: Severe, sudden loss of vision and a dull ache in the left eye.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old female with type 2 diabetes and glaucoma presented with vision of Counting Fingers and a positive relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD). Clinical examination showed extensive retinal haemorrhages and cotton wool spots, with FFA demonstrating >10 disc areas of capillary non-perfusion. Despite initial anti-VEGF therapy, she developed rubeosis iridis at three months and required urgent pan-retinal photocoagulation (PRP).

retinal_vascular_occlusions_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO)
  presenting_complaint: Noticed a "smudge" or dark patch in the upper field of vision of the left eye.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female smoker presented with an inferotemporal BRVO at an arteriovenous crossing. OCT imaging revealed cystoid macular oedema involving the fovea, reducing acuity to 6/12. She was treated with an intravitreal dexamethasone implant (Ozurdex), which successfully resolved the oedema and restored vision to 6/6 by week eight.

retinal_vascular_occlusions_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, total loss of vision in the right eye, occurring over seconds.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with atrial fibrillation presented to the emergency department with vision of No Perception of Light (NPL). Examination revealed a pale, opaque retina with a classic "cherry-red spot" at the macula and "box-carring" of the retinal arteries. Despite immediate ocular massage and anterior chamber paracentesis, the visual prognosis remained poor due to the prolonged ischaemic interval.

retinal_vascular_occlusions_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Branch Retinal Artery Occlusion (BRAO)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden loss of the bottom half of vision in the right eye.
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male with hyperlipidaemia presented with a superior BRAO caused by a visible Hollenhorst plaque at a bifurcation. Carotid Doppler ultrasound identified significant ipsilateral internal carotid artery stenosis. He was started on dual antiplatelet therapy and referred for urgent carotid endarterectomy to prevent further embolic events.

retinal_vascular_occlusions_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Hemi-retinal Vein Occlusion (HRVO)
  presenting_complaint: Blurred vision in the superior half of the visual field.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with a history of systemic hypertension presented with haemorrhages restricted to the superior hemisphere of the left retina. FFA confirmed a hemi-retinal vein occlusion involving the superior primary venous trunk at the disc. He was managed with monthly Ranibizumab injections for secondary macular oedema, showing a stable clinical response.

retinal_vascular_occlusions_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Cilioretinal Artery Occlusion
  presenting_complaint: Sudden central vision loss with preservation of peripheral sight.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with known systemic lupus erythematosus presented with acute central scotoma. Fundoscopy showed an area of retinal whitening in the distribution of the cilioretinal artery, while the rest of the retinal perfusion remained intact. Investigations for systemic vasculitis were intensified, and she was started on high-dose oral prednisolone.

retinal_vascular_occlusions_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Combined Central Retinal Artery and Vein Occlusion
  presenting_complaint: Rapid, painful loss of vision in the left eye following a blunt orbital injury.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male presented with a retrobulbar haemorrhage and orbital compartment syndrome following a road traffic accident. The resulting high intraorbital pressure caused a combined CRAO and CRVO. Despite an emergency lateral canthotomy and cantholysis, the retina suffered extensive ischaemic damage, resulting in permanent vision loss.

retinal_vascular_occlusions_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Papillophlebitis (CRVO in the young)
  presenting_complaint: Mild blurring of vision and "floaters" in a 22-year-old.
  summary_of_course: A healthy, athletic 22-year-old male presented with optic disc oedema and mild venous engorgement resembling a CRVO. Extensive thrombophilia screening and systemic workup were negative. The condition was diagnosed as papillophlebitis, a benign variant of CRVO in young adults, which resolved spontaneously over six months with vision returning to 6/5.

retinal_vascular_occlusions_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Neovascular Glaucoma secondary to CRVO
  presenting_complaint: Severe eye pain, redness, and nausea three months after a "stroke in the eye".
  summary_of_course: A 76-year-old male who had previously declined treatment for an ischaemic CRVO presented with an intraocular pressure of 52 mmHg. Slit-lamp examination showed extensive rubeosis iridis and an opaque cornea. He required urgent aqueous suppressants, intravitreal Bevacizumab to regress vessels, and subsequent cyclodiode laser treatment for pressure control.

retinal_vascular_occlusions_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Ocular Ischaemic Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Gradual loss of vision and "dazzling" when walking into bright light.
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old male smoker with peripheral vascular disease presented with mid-peripheral dot-and-blot haemorrhages and dilated, non-tortuous veins. Unlike a CRVO, the retinal arteries were narrowed and the intraocular pressure was low. Carotid imaging revealed 95% occlusion of the common carotid artery, and he was prioritised for vascular surgery.

retinal_vascular_occlusions_012:
  primary_diagnosis: CRVO secondary to Hyperviscosity Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral blurred vision and recurrent epistaxis.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male was found to have bilateral CRVO-like fundus appearances with extreme venous tortuosity ("link-sausage" vessels). Blood tests revealed a significantly elevated IgM level and a diagnosis of Waldenström macroglobulinaemia. He underwent urgent plasmapheresis, which led to a rapid improvement in retinal circulation and visual acuity.

retinal_vascular_occlusions_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic BRVO with Vitreous Haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of dark cobwebs and "ink-like" streaks in vision.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old female with a three-year history of untreated BRVO presented with an acute vitreous haemorrhage. B-scan ultrasonography and subsequent clinical exam identified neovascularisation elsewhere (NVE) in the ischaemic sector. She was treated with PRP to the affected quadrant and intravitreal anti-VEGF to clear the haemorrhage and regress the vessels.

retinal_vascular_occlusions_014:
  primary_diagnosis: CRAO secondary to Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden vision loss preceded by scalp tenderness and jaw claudication.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female presented with a right CRAO and a pale, swollen optic disc. Her ESR was 95 mm/hr and CRP was 110 mg/L. She was immediately started on IV methylprednisolone to protect the contralateral eye, and a temporal artery biopsy confirmed GCA.

retinal_vascular_occlusions_015:
  primary_diagnosis: BRVO with persistent Macular Oedema
  presenting_complaint: Distorted central vision (metamorphopsia) for six months.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with chronic BRVO showed poor response to monthly Ranibizumab, with persistent intraretinal fluid on OCT. He was switched to Aflibercept on a treat-and-extend protocol, which achieved better fluid drying. However, vision remained limited to 6/18 due to chronic foveal structural changes and pigmentary migration.

retinal_vascular_occlusions_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Susac Syndrome (Multiple BRAOs)
  presenting_complaint: Multiple "blind spots", hearing loss, and mild confusion.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female presented with multiple peripheral branch retinal artery occlusions in both eyes. MRI brain showed "snowball" lesions in the corpus callosum, and audiometry confirmed sensorineural hearing loss. She was diagnosed with Susac syndrome and commenced on long-term immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids.

retinal_vascular_occlusions_017:
  primary_diagnosis: CRVO in Pregnancy (Preeclampsia)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden blurring of vision in the left eye during the third trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old pregnant female with severe preeclampsia (BP 180/110 mmHg) developed a non-ischaemic CRVO. Management focused on urgent BP control and delivery of the foetus. Post-partum, the retinal haemorrhages and macular oedema resolved spontaneously without the need for intravitreal therapy, and vision returned to 6/6.

retinal_vascular_occlusions_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Sickle Cell Retinopathy with Peripheral Artery Occlusion
  presenting_complaint: Peripheral shadows and flashes of light.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with HbSS sickle cell disease presented with peripheral retinal whitening and "sea-fan" neovascularisation. FFA showed extensive peripheral capillary non-perfusion (arterial occlusions). He underwent sectorial laser photocoagulation to the ischaemic areas to prevent vitreous haemorrhage and tractional retinal detachment.

retinal_vascular_occlusions_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Bilateral CRVO secondary to Protein S Deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive blurring in both eyes over three days.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female with no prior medical history presented with bilateral CRVO. A comprehensive thrombophilia screen revealed a significant Protein S deficiency. She was started on lifelong anticoagulation with Warfarin and received bilateral intravitreal anti-VEGF injections to manage the associated macular oedema.

retinal_vascular_occlusions_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic BRVO
  presenting_complaint: New area of vision loss in an eye with known previous vascular issues.
  summary_of_course: A 71-year-old male with a history of a superior BRVO five years ago presented with a new inferior BRVO. Examination showed old collateral vessels superiorly and fresh flame haemorrhages inferiorly. This "double" occlusion prompted a re-evaluation of his cardiovascular risk factors, leading to a new diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnoea and nocturnal hypertension.
