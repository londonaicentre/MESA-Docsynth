  primary_diagnosis: Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent oral, skin, and nail fungal infections since infancy
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old girl with a history of persistent thrush and dystrophic fingernails was referred to immunology. Investigations revealed a STAT1 gain-of-function mutation. She requires long-term prophylactic antifungal therapy and specialist monitoring for associated endocrinopathies, representing a complex primary immunodeficiency.

  presenting_complaint: Six episodes of vaginal thrush within a twelve-month period
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female presented with frequent recurrences of vaginal itching and discharge. Culture and sensitivity testing identified Candida glabrata, which showed reduced susceptibility to azoles. She was managed with a prolonged induction and maintenance regimen of boric acid vaginal suppositories, leading to symptomatic control.

candidiasis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Candidal endophthalmitis
  presenting_complaint: Blurred vision and floaters in the right eye
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female, recently treated for candidemia secondary to an infected central line, reported new-onset visual disturbances. Fundoscopy revealed "fluff-ball" chorioretinal lesions. She underwent urgent vitrectomy and intravitreal antifungal injection alongside systemic therapy to prevent permanent vision loss.

candidiasis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Candidal urinary tract infection
  presenting_complaint: Cloudy urine and suprapubic discomfort
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old male with a long-term indwelling urinary catheter and multiple comorbidities presented with foul-smelling urine. Urinalysis showed pyuria, and urine culture grew >10^5 CFU/mL of Candida tropicalis. The catheter was replaced, and a short course of fluconazole was administered due to the patient's symptomatic state and risk of ascending infection.

candidiasis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Denture-induced atrophic candidiasis
  presenting_complaint: Red, sore palate under a dental prosthesis
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male presented with a burning sensation in his mouth. Examination showed diffuse erythema of the hard palate perfectly demarcated by the footprint of his upper denture. He was diagnosed with chronic atrophic candidiasis (denture stomatitis) and treated with miconazole oromucosal gel and instructions on nocturnal denture removal and disinfection.

candidiasis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic hyperplastic candidiasis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent white patch on the inside of the cheek
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male smoker presented with a non-scrapable white plaque on the retrocommissural buccal mucosa. An incisional biopsy was performed to exclude leukoplakia, showing fungal hyphae invading the epithelium. He completed a 3-week course of systemic fluconazole, resulting in significant regression of the lesion, and was strongly advised on smoking cessation.

candidiasis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Candidal peritonitis
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal pain and cloudy effluent in peritoneal dialysis
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female on CAPD for end-stage renal failure presented with acute abdominal pain and fever. Peritoneal fluid microscopy showed yeast cells, and cultures confirmed Candida albicans. The PD catheter was removed promptly, and she was started on IV anidulafungin, eventually transitioning to haemodialysis.

candidiasis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Candidal endocarditis
  presenting_complaint: Fever, weight loss, and a new cardiac murmur
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use presented with subacute malaise. Echocardiogram revealed a 1.5cm vegetation on the aortic valve. Blood cultures were positive for Candida parapsilosis. He required a combination of high-dose liposomal amphotericin B and urgent aortic valve replacement surgery.

candidiasis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Diaper dermatitis with secondary candidiasis
  presenting_complaint: Severe nappy rash with bright red spots
  summary_of_course: A 10-month-old infant presented with a confluent, beefy red rash in the nappy area that spared the skin folds but featured numerous satellite papules. The rash had failed to respond to barrier creams. A clinical diagnosis of secondary candidal infection was made, and the rash cleared within 5 days of using topical clotrimazole cream.

  presenting_complaint: Penile itching and white patches on the glans
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old uncircumcised male with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes presented with inflammation of the glans penis and prepuce. Small white plaques and erosions were visible. He was treated with topical imidazole cream and referred for diabetic review to address persistent hyperglycaemia, which was predisposing him to fungal overgrowth.

candidiasis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Disseminated candidiasis (Candida auris)
  presenting_complaint: Multi-organ failure and refractory fungaemia
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male in a neurosurgical ICU developed a bloodstream infection with Candida auris during a known hospital outbreak. The isolate demonstrated high-level resistance to fluconazole and amphotericin B. Despite aggressive treatment with high-dose echinocandins and strict isolation protocols, the patient succumbed to multi-organ failure.
