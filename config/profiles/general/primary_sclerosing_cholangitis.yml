primary_sclerosing_cholangitis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis with Ulcerative Colitis
  presenting_complaint: Progressive pruritus and lethargy.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male with a 10-year history of ulcerative colitis presents with worsening nocturnal itch and fatigue. Liver function tests reveal a cholestatic pattern with ALP 580 U/L and GGT 420 U/L; MRCP demonstrates multifocal intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary strictures with a "beaded" appearance. He is commenced on ursodeoxycholic acid and enrolled in a colonoscopic surveillance programme due to increased colorectal cancer risk.

primary_sclerosing_cholangitis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Small-Duct Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis
  presenting_complaint: Persistently deranged liver enzymes.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female with quiescent Crohn's disease is noted to have chronically elevated ALP on routine monitoring. Repeated MRCP imaging is unremarkable, but a percutaneous liver biopsy reveals characteristic "onion-skin" concentric periductal fibrosis. She is diagnosed with small-duct PSC, which carries a more favourable prognosis than large-duct disease, and remains stable on conservative management.

primary_sclerosing_cholangitis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: PSC with Dominant Stricture
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of obstructive jaundice and pale stools.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with known PSC presents with a rapid rise in bilirubin to 110 µmol/L and worsening RUQ pain. MRCP identifies a dominant stricture in the common hepatic duct; subsequent ERCP with balloon dilatation and brush cytology is performed to exclude malignancy. Cytology shows no high-grade dysplasia, and his bilirubin levels improve significantly post-procedure.

primary_sclerosing_cholangitis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: PSC-associated Cholangiocarcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss, worsening jaundice, and anorexia.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with long-standing PSC and cirrhosis presents with a 6kg weight loss over two months. Investigations reveal a CA19-9 of 1,200 U/mL and a mass at the splenic flexure of the liver on CT, while MRCP shows a suspicious hilar stricture. Following multidisciplinary review, he is diagnosed with advanced cholangiocarcinoma and referred for palliative biliary stenting and oncology support.

primary_sclerosing_cholangitis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Autoimmune Hepatitis-PSC Overlap Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice and hepatosplenomegaly.
  summary_of_course: An 11-year-old girl presents with acute icterus and malaise; bloods show ALT 850 U/L and ALP 900 U/L with positive ANA and ASMA titres. Liver biopsy shows interface hepatitis alongside histological features of sclerosing cholangitis, confirming "autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis." She responds well to a combination of prednisolone, azathioprine, and ursodeoxycholic acid.

primary_sclerosing_cholangitis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Bacterial Cholangitis secondary to PSC
  presenting_complaint: Rigors, high fever, and right upper quadrant pain.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female with known PSC is admitted via A&E with Charcot's triad. She is tachycardic and hypotensive, requiring IV fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam). Urgent ERCP is performed to relieve biliary obstruction caused by a sludge-impacted stricture, resulting in rapid clinical stabilisation.

primary_sclerosing_cholangitis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: End-stage PSC with Decompensated Cirrhosis
  presenting_complaint: Increasing abdominal girth and peripheral oedema.
  summary_of_course: A 56-year-old male with a 20-year history of PSC presents with new-onset ascites and hypoalbuminaemia. Clinical examination confirms shifting dullness and spider naevi; ultrasound shows a small, nodular liver and splenomegaly. He is commenced on spironolactone and furosemide and is referred to a tertiary centre for liver transplant assessment.

primary__sclerosing_cholangitis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent PSC post-Liver Transplant
  presenting_complaint: Rising alkaline phosphatase five years post-transplant.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male, who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation for PSC in 2018, shows a progressive rise in ALP to 400 U/L during routine follow-up. Protocol biopsy and MRCP confirm the recurrence of PSC in the graft, excluding hepatic artery stenosis and rejection. Management focuses on optimising immunosuppression and monitoring for further ductal progression.

primary_sclerosing_cholangitis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic PSC
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of raised GGT.
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old male undergoing insurance screening is found to have a GGT of 180 U/L and ALP of 210 U/L with normal transaminases and bilirubin. He is asymptomatic with no history of IBD; however, MRCP reveals early-stage multifocal pruning of the intrahepatic ducts. He is diagnosed with early-stage PSC and started on UDCA with 6-monthly LFT monitoring.

primary_sclerosing_cholangitis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: PSC with Gallbladder Polyps
  presenting_complaint: Routine surveillance ultrasound finding.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old female with stable PSC undergoes annual gallbladder surveillance, which identifies a new 6mm polyp. Given the high risk of gallbladder carcinoma in PSC patients, she is referred for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy regardless of the polyp size. Histopathology reveals mucosal dysplasia but no invasive malignancy, justifying the aggressive surgical approach.

primary_sclerosing_cholangitis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: PSC with Refractory Pruritus
  presenting_complaint: Intractable, whole-body itching causing insomnia.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male with moderate PSC suffers from pruritus that has failed to respond to colestyramine, rifampicin, and naltrexone. His quality of life is severely impacted, leading to clinical depression. He is eventually referred for consideration of experimental therapies or biliary diversion surgery to manage the cholestatic symptoms.

primary_sclerosing_cholangitis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: PSC with Portal Hypertension and Variceal Haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Haematemesis and melaena.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old female with PSC-related cirrhosis presents to the emergency department with a large volume haematemesis. Urgent endoscopy reveals Grade III oesophageal varices with active bleeding, which are successfully treated with band ligation. She is started on carvedilol for primary prophylaxis against further bleeds and listed for urgent transplant review.

primary_sclerosing_cholangitis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: PSC with Metabolic Bone Disease
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset back pain following a minor fall.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female with long-standing PSC presents with a vertebral compression fracture. DEXA scanning reveals a T-score of -3.2, confirming severe osteoporosis secondary to chronic malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins and chronic inflammation. She is treated with bisphosphonates, high-dose Vitamin D, and calcium supplementation.

primary_sclerosing_cholangitis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: PSC with IgG4-positive features
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice and weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male presents with obstructive jaundice and elevated serum IgG4 levels (3.2 g/L). While initially suspicious for IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis, the distribution of strictures on MRCP and lack of pancreatic involvement suggest a PSC phenotype with elevated IgG4. He shows a partial biochemical response to corticosteroids but eventually requires UDCA as the disease progresses.

primary_sclerosing_cholangitis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) in PSC
  presenting_complaint: Confusion and worsening jaundice following a chest infection.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with known PSC-cirrhosis is admitted with Grade 2 hepatic encephalopathy and a bilirubin of 250 µmol/L triggered by community-acquired pneumonia. He is managed in the High Dependency Unit with lactulose, rifaximin, and intravenous antibiotics. His clinical state stabilises, but his MELD score remains high, necessitating an expedited transplant workup.

primary_sclerosing_cholangitis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: PSC with Crohn's Colitis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic diarrhoea and RUQ discomfort.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male with a new diagnosis of Crohn's colitis is found to have an ALP of 450 U/L. MRCP confirms intrahepatic biliary strictures consistent with PSC. The patient is managed with infliximab for his colitis and UDCA for PSC, with close monitoring for the "backwash ileitis" and rectal sparing often seen in this specific phenotype.

primary_sclerosing_cholangitis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: PSC in an Elderly Patient
  presenting_complaint: New onset jaundice and pruritus.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male presents with cholestatic jaundice; initial suspicion is pancreatic malignancy or choledocholithiasis. However, CT and MRCP show no masses but reveal classic "beading" of the biliary tree, and colonoscopy identifies previously silent ulcerative colitis. This late-onset presentation of PSC is rare and requires careful differentiation from secondary sclerosing cholangitis.

primary_sclerosing_cholangitis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: PSC with Hepatic Sarcoidosis Overlap
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue and dry cough.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female with known pulmonary sarcoidosis develops cholestatic LFTs and RUQ pain. Imaging shows biliary strictures typical of PSC, but liver biopsy also reveals non-caseating granulomas. She is managed for both conditions with a combination of steroids and UDCA, though her long-term prognosis remains guarded due to the dual inflammatory burden.

primary_sclerosing_cholangitis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: PSC in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Severe pruritus in the third trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant female with known PSC develops worsening itch at 30 weeks gestation. It is difficult to distinguish between a PSC flare and obstetric cholestasis; however, her bile acids rise to 120 µmol/L. She is managed with increased doses of UDCA and undergoes elective induction of labour at 37 weeks to mitigate foetal risk.

primary_sclerosing_cholangitis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: PSC with Biliary Perforation
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, severe abdominal pain and peritonitis.
  summary_of_course: A 47-year-old male with advanced PSC presents with an acute abdomen. Emergency CT reveals pneumoperitoneum and free fluid, and laparotomy confirms a spontaneous perforation of the common bile duct proximal to a high-grade stricture. He undergoes emergency biliary reconstruction and washout, followed by a prolonged ICU recovery for biliary sepsis.
