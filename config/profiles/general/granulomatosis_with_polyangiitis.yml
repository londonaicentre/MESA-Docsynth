wegener_granulomatosis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener Granulomatosis)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent epistaxis, crusting of the nasal mucosa, and haemoptysis.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented with a 3-month history of refractory sinusitis and recent onset of coughing up blood. Investigations revealed c-ANCA (PR3) positivity, multiple cavitating nodules on CT thorax, and a creatinine of 180 µmol/L. He was diagnosed with Wegener Granulomatosis and commenced on IV methylprednisolone and rituximab, resulting in rapid symptomatic improvement.

wegener_granulomatosis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Limited Wegener Granulomatosis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic ear pain and progressive hearing loss.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old female with a history of recurrent otitis media failed multiple courses of antibiotics. Audiometry showed conductive hearing loss, and biopsy of the middle ear mucosa demonstrated granulomatous inflammation without renal involvement. She was started on oral prednisolone and methotrexate, achieving remission of her localised ENT symptoms within four months.

wegener_granulomatosis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Wegener Granulomatosis with Diffuse Alveolar Haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Acute breathlessness and massive haemoptysis.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Bronchoalveolar lavage confirmed diffuse alveolar haemorrhage, and serology was strongly PR3-ANCA positive. He required emergency plasma exchange, pulsed cyclophosphamide, and mechanical ventilation, eventually stabilising after a stormy 3-week admission.

wegener_granulomatosis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Wegener Granulomatosis with Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis
  presenting_complaint: Malaise, oliguria, and peripheral oedema.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male presented with subacute kidney injury, with creatinine rising from 90 to 450 µmol/L over two weeks. Urinalysis showed microscopic haematuria and proteinuria; renal biopsy confirmed pauci-immune necrotising crescentic glomerulonephritis. Despite aggressive immunosuppression with steroids and cyclophosphamide, he remained dialysis-dependent.

wegener_granulomatosis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Wegener Granulomatosis
  presenting_complaint: Stridor and barking cough.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old girl was initially treated for croup, but symptoms persisted. Laryngoscopy revealed subglottic stenosis, and further screening showed high titres of c-ANCA. She was diagnosed with Wegener Granulomatosis and underwent balloon dilatation of the airway alongside systemic steroid and mycophenolate mofetil therapy.

wegener_granulomatosis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Wegener Granulomatosis mimicking metastatic malignancy
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss, night sweats, and multiple lung nodules on chest X-ray.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old smoker was referred to the lung cancer MDT for suspected metastatic disease. PET-CT showed FDG-avid lung nodules and paranasal sinus thickening; however, biopsy of a lung lesion showed necrotising granulomas and vasculitis. Diagnosis of Wegener Granulomatosis was confirmed via ANCA serology, and he responded well to immunosuppression.

wegener_granulomatosis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Relapsing Wegener Granulomatosis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrence of saddle nose deformity and joint pains.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female, known to have Wegener’s for 10 years, presented with a flare after tapering her maintenance azathioprine. Examination showed new collapse of the nasal bridge and migratory polyarthritis. Her PR3-ANCA titres had risen significantly, necessitating a switch to rituximab for re-induction of remission.

wegener_granulomatosis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Ocular Wegener Granulomatosis
  presenting_complaint: Severe red eye, pain, and photophobia.
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old male presented to ophthalmology with scleritis that was non-responsive to topical agents. Further systemic review revealed a history of crusting rhinitis and lethargy. Investigations confirmed c-ANCA positivity, and the diagnosis of Wegener Granulomatosis was made, preventing potential globe perforation through systemic steroid treatment.

wegener_granulomatosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Wegener Granulomatosis with Mononeuritis Multiplex
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of foot drop and tingling in the left hand.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female presented with asymmetrical neuropathy and systemic vasculitic symptoms. Nerve conduction studies confirmed mononeuritis multiplex, and a sural nerve biopsy showed small-vessel vasculitis. Diagnosis of Wegener Granulomatosis was established with positive PR3-ANCA, and she was treated with pulsed methylprednisolone.

wegener_granulomatosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Cutaneous Wegener Granulomatosis
  presenting_complaint: Palpable purpura and necrotic ulcers on the lower limbs.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male presented with painful skin lesions and arthralgia. Skin biopsy demonstrated leucocytoclastic vasculitis with granulomatous features. Although initially presenting with skin-limited disease, subsequent CT imaging showed asymptomatic pulmonary nodules, confirming a systemic diagnosis of Wegener Granulomatosis.

wegener_granulomatosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Wegener Granulomatosis with Secondary Pneumocystis Jirovecii Pneumonia
  presenting_complaint: Fever, dry cough, and worsening hypoxia during vasculitis treatment.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old patient on high-dose steroids and cyclophosphamide for Wegener Granulomatosis developed acute respiratory distress. Induced sputum PCR was positive for Pneumocystis jirovecii (PJP), likely due to inadequate prophylaxis. He required treatment with co-trimoxazole while his immunosuppression was temporarily reduced.

wegener_granulomatosis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic Wegener Granulomatosis Flare
  presenting_complaint: Worsening renal function and new-onset haemoptysis.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with a 5-year history of Wegener’s in clinical remission presented with a sudden flare following a viral infection. His creatinine jumped from 110 to 300 µmol/L, and new pulmonary infiltrates appeared on CT. He was treated with "add-on" plasma exchange and rituximab, successfully stabilising his renal function.

wegener_granulomatosis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Wegener Granulomatosis with Cardiac Involvement
  presenting_complaint: Chest pain and palpitations.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female with known Wegener Granulomatosis presented with pericarditic chest pain. Cardiac MRI showed late gadolinium enhancement consistent with myocarditis, and ECG showed non-specific ST changes. Her immunosuppressive regimen was intensified to include mycophenolate mofetil, leading to resolution of cardiac symptoms.

wegener_granulomatosis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Wegener Granulomatosis in an Elderly Patient with Comorbidities
  presenting_complaint: Generalised weakness, anaemia, and mild haematuria.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with Type 2 diabetes and CCF presented with a normocytic anaemia and rising inflammatory markers. Despite his age, a c-ANCA test was strongly positive, and Wegener Granulomatosis was diagnosed. Due to his frailty, he was treated with a modified "Rituxvas" protocol using reduced-dose steroids to mitigate infection risk.

wegener_granulomatosis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Wegener Granulomatosis presenting as Refractory Otitis Media
  presenting_complaint: Persistent ear discharge and facial nerve palsy.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male was treated for six months for "chronic mastoiditis" without success. He eventually developed a lower motor neurone facial nerve palsy. Biopsy of the granulation tissue in the ear canal showed necrotising vasculitis, and Wegener Granulomatosis was confirmed, requiring urgent systemic cyclophosphamide.

wegener_granulomatosis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute Wegener Granulomatosis with Constitutional Symptoms
  presenting_complaint: Unexplained weight loss, drenching night sweats, and low-grade fever.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old female underwent extensive investigation for pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO). While initial infectious and malignant screens were negative, a vasculitis screen revealed a PR3-ANCA titre >100 IU/mL. Subsequent CT sinuses showed erosive changes, confirming Wegener Granulomatosis as the cause of her systemic inflammatory state.

wegener_granulomatosis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Treatment-Refractory Wegener Granulomatosis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent pulmonary nodules despite cyclophosphamide therapy.
  summary_of_course: A 56-year-old male failed to achieve remission after six months of oral cyclophosphamide for Wegener Granulomatosis. Repeat CT showed enlarging cavitary lesions and persistent haematuria. He was switched to rituximab and belimumab as part of a clinical trial for refractory ANCA-associated vasculitis, finally achieving biochemical stability.

wegener_granulomatosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Wegener Granulomatosis with Gastrointestinal Involvement
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with known pulmonary Wegener’s presented with an acute abdomen. Laparotomy revealed segmentally ischaemic bowel, and histology showed medium and small vessel vasculitis within the mesenteric arcade. This rare gastrointestinal manifestation required intensive post-operative immunosuppression and parenteral nutrition.

wegener_granulomatosis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Postpartum Flare of Wegener Granulomatosis
  presenting_complaint: New onset of breathlessness and haematuria three weeks after delivery.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female with previously quiescent Wegener Granulomatosis experienced a severe flare in the postpartum period. Her c-ANCA titre rose sharply, and she developed acute glomerulonephritis. She was treated with steroids and azathioprine (compatible with breastfeeding) but eventually required rituximab due to the severity of the renal decline.

wegener_granulomatosis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic Wegener Granulomatosis (Incidental Finding)
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of lung nodules on CT for trauma.
  summary_of_course: A 47-year-old male underwent a CT scan following a road traffic accident, which showed several asymptomatic cavitating nodules. Despite having no respiratory or renal symptoms, his PR3-ANCA was positive and a lung biopsy confirmed Wegener Granulomatosis. He was started on "early" induction therapy with methotrexate and steroids to prevent end-organ damage.
