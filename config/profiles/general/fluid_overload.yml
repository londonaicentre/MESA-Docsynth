fluid_overload_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Decompensated Congestive Heart Failure
  presenting_complaint: Worsening shortness of breath and orthopnoea over four days.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male with known ischaemic heart disease presented with acute-on-chronic fluid overload. Physical examination revealed a raised JVP, bilateral pitting pedal oedema to the mid-calf, and fine bibasal crackles on auscultation. He was treated with intravenous furosemide boluses and strict fluid restriction, resulting in a 4kg weight loss and symptomatic improvement over 72 hours.

fluid_overload_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Nephrotic Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Periorbital swelling and abdominal distension.
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old girl presented with sudden onset facial puffiness, most prominent in the mornings. Urinalysis showed 4+ proteinuria, and serum albumin was 18g/L, confirming nephrotic syndrome with significant third-spacing. She was managed with oral prednisolone and cautious salt restriction, with gradual resolution of the generalised oedema.

fluid_overload_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Kidney Injury with Oliguric Fluid Overload
  presenting_complaint: Reduced urine output and progressive breathlessness following major surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male developed Stage 3 AKI post-aorto-bifemoral bypass. Despite fluid resuscitation for hypotension, he became oliguric and developed severe pulmonary oedema with oxygen saturations of 88% on room air. He required urgent continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in the ICU for fluid removal and metabolic control.

fluid_overload_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Decompensated Liver Cirrhosis with Ascites
  presenting_complaint: Increasing abdominal girth and discomfort.
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old female with alcoholic cirrhosis presented with tense ascites and mild peripheral oedema. Ultrasound confirmed significant intraperitoneal fluid and portal vein hypertension. She underwent a large-volume paracentesis (LVP) with 6 litres drained and received intravenous human albumin solution to prevent post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction.

fluid_overload_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic Hypervolaemia
  presenting_complaint: New onset cough and mild dyspnoea post-operatively.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old healthy female received 5 litres of 0.9% sodium chloride over 12 hours following an uncomplicated appendicectomy. She developed mild tachypnoea and bibasal crackles; CXR showed prominent upper lobe diversion. The IV fluids were discontinued, and a single dose of oral bumetanide resolved the symptoms within 6 hours.

fluid_overload_006:
  primary_diagnosis: End-Stage Renal Disease with Missed Dialysis
  presenting_complaint: Severe respiratory distress and inability to lie flat.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female on maintenance haemodialysis presented after missing two sessions. She was in extremis with "flash" pulmonary oedema, BP 190/110 mmHg, and profound hypoxia. Immediate management included non-invasive ventilation (CPAP) and emergent haemodialysis for ultrafiltration, which successfully cleared the fluid overload.

fluid_overload_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Preeclampsia with Systemic Oedema
  presenting_complaint: Severe headache, blurred vision, and rapid swelling of hands and face.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old primigravida at 34 weeks gestation presented with a BP of 165/110 mmHg and significant systemic fluid retention. Investigations revealed proteinuria and elevated liver enzymes. Following stabilization with magnesium sulphate and antihypertensives, she underwent an emergency caesarean section; postpartum diuresis was managed carefully to prevent pulmonary complications.

fluid_overload_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Cor Pulmonale secondary to COPD
  presenting_complaint: Persistent bilateral leg swelling and increased fatigue.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male smoker with severe COPD presented with chronic right-sided heart failure. Examination showed a prominent parasternal heave and pitting oedema extending to the thighs. He was started on long-term oxygen therapy and low-dose spironolactone, which provided gradual reduction in systemic fluid volume over several weeks.

fluid_overload_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Flash Pulmonary Oedema secondary to Myocardial Ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, severe breathlessness and pink frothy sputum.
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old male presented with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Within minutes of arrival, he developed hyperacute pulmonary oedema due to acute left ventricular dysfunction. He was intubated, treated with nitrates and diuretics, and underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to restore myocardial perfusion.

fluid_overload_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Ascites in End-Stage Liver Disease
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent abdominal swelling despite high-dose diuretics.
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male with NASH-related cirrhosis presented with persistent ascites despite maximal doses of spironolactone and furosemide. He was deemed to have refractory fluid overload and was referred for a Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) procedure. Post-procedure, his fluid balance became manageable with significantly lower diuretic requirements.

fluid_overload_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Sepsis-Associated Fluid Overload
  presenting_complaint: Hypotension and multi-organ failure.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male in septic shock from urosepsis received 8 litres of crystalloid during initial resuscitation in the ICU. While haemodynamically stable, he developed severe positive fluid balance (10kg above baseline) and ARDS-like respiratory failure. Management shifted to a conservative fluid strategy using furosemide infusions to achieve a net negative balance.

fluid_overload_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Protein-Losing Enteropathy
  presenting_complaint: Generalised swelling (anasarca) and chronic diarrhoea.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female with Crohn's disease presented with profound oedema of the limbs, trunk, and face. Serum albumin was 14g/L despite normal liver and renal function. Diagnosis of protein-losing enteropathy was made via alpha-1-antitrypsin clearance; fluid overload was managed with albumin infusions and treatment of the underlying inflammatory bowel disease.

fluid_overload_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-Renal Transplant Delayed Graft Function
  presenting_complaint: Weight gain and hypertension one week post-transplant.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male underwent a deceased donor renal transplant but remained anuric post-operatively. He accumulated 7kg of fluid over five days, leading to hypertension and peripheral oedema. He required three sessions of haemodialysis for fluid removal until the graft began functioning on day eight, after which he had a significant spontaneous diuresis.

fluid_overload_014:
  primary_diagnosis: High-Output Heart Failure secondary to Chronic Anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations, breathlessness, and ankle swelling.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with a haemoglobin of 52g/L due to occult GI bleeding presented with signs of fluid overload. The high-output state led to secondary hypervolaemia; she was treated with slow blood transfusions under cover of intravenous furosemide to prevent transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO).

fluid_overload_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Thiazide-Induced Hyponatraemia with Mild Hypervolaemia
  presenting_complaint: Confusion and mild peripheral oedema.
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old female recently started on bendroflumethiazide presented with a sodium of 118mmol/L. While appearing slightly fluid overloaded on examination, her primary issue was water retention exceeding salt retention. The thiazide was stopped, and she was managed with fluid restriction (800ml/day), leading to a gradual correction of sodium and resolution of oedema.

fluid_overload_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Right Heart Failure in Adult Congenital Heart Disease
  presenting_complaint: Increasing abdominal fullness and exertional dyspnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male with a history of repaired Tetralogy of Fallot presented with severe pulmonary regurgitation. He had significant hepatomegaly and pulsatile JVP, indicating right-sided fluid overload. He was managed with aggressive diuresis and scheduled for a pulmonary valve replacement to address the underlying haemodynamic cause.

fluid_overload_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Nutritional Hypoalbuminaemic Oedema
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral leg swelling and weakness.
  summary_of_course: An 89-year-old socially isolated male was found with severe bilateral pitting oedema to the groin. Investigations showed a serum albumin of 20g/L and multiple vitamin deficiencies, but normal cardiac and renal markers. He was diagnosed with malnutrition-related fluid shifts and treated with dietetic support and very cautious diuresis to avoid intravascular depletion.

fluid_overload_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Venous Insufficiency mimicking Heart Failure
  presenting_complaint: Chronic, heavy, swollen legs.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old obese female presented to the outpatient clinic with long-standing bilateral leg oedema. Despite initial suspicion of heart failure, her NT-proBNP was normal and echocardiogram showed preserved ejection fraction. The fluid retention was attributed to severe venous insufficiency and dependent oedema; she was managed with compression hosiery and leg elevation rather than diuretics.

fluid_overload_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Chemotherapy-Induced Cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: New onset orthopnoea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 46-year-old female undergoing treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer with Trastuzumab presented with acute breathlessness. Echocardiography revealed a drop in LVEF to 30% with associated pulmonary venous congestion. She was treated for acute fluid overload with IV diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and her chemotherapy was temporarily suspended.

fluid_overload_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Peritoneal Dialysis Ultrafiltration Failure
  presenting_complaint: Inability to achieve target weight and rising blood pressure.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male on CAPD for five years reported that his "drains" were no longer matching his intake. He presented with 5kg of fluid gain and new-onset bibasal crackles. Peritoneal equilibration testing confirmed membrane failure; he was transitioned to haemodialysis to effectively manage his fluid overload and uraemia.
