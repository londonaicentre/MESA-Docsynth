boerhaave_syndrome_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Boerhaave syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Sudden-onset retrosternal chest pain and forceful vomiting
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented to A&E with Mackler’s triad following heavy alcohol consumption. Clinical examination revealed subcutaneous emphysema in the neck and a left-sided pleural effusion on chest X-ray. CT thorax with oral contrast confirmed a distal oesophageal perforation with pneumomediastinum, requiring urgent primary surgical repair and mediastinal debridement.

boerhaave_syndrome_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Boerhaave syndrome with tension pneumothorax
  presenting_complaint: Acute breathlessness and collapse after retching
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female with a history of bulimia nervosa suffered sudden respiratory distress following self-induced vomiting. Initial assessment suggested a tension pneumothorax, but post-decompression CT identified a transmural oesophageal tear and hydropneumothorax. She was stabilised in ICU and underwent oesophageal stenting with bilateral chest drain insertion.

boerhaave_syndrome_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute Boerhaave syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Pleuritic chest pain and persistent pyrexia
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male presented 72 hours after an episode of severe retching, initially misdiagnosed as community-acquired pneumonia. Thoracentesis of a large left-sided effusion revealed foul-smelling fluid with a high amylase level and food particles. Contrast swallow confirmed a late-presenting oesophageal leak, necessitating decortication and a feeding jejunostomy.

boerhaave_syndrome_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Atypical Boerhaave syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Epigastric pain radiating to the back
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old female with dementia presented with vague abdominal distress and tachycardia but no history of vomiting. Bloods showed raised inflammatory markers and a negative troponin, but a CT abdomen/thorax performed for suspected pancreatitis revealed pneumomediastinum and a distal oesophageal rupture. Due to extreme frailty and multiple comorbidities, she was managed palliatively.

boerhaave_syndrome_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Contained Boerhaave syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Retrosternal discomfort and odynophagia
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old male experienced sharp pain after a large meal followed by mild retching. CT imaging showed a small amount of extraluminal air localised to the mediastinum without pleural soilage, suggesting a contained leak. He was managed conservatively with nil by mouth, intravenous antibiotics, and total parenteral nutrition (TPN), showing complete resolution on follow-up Gastrografin swallow.

boerhaave_syndrome_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Boerhaave syndrome with septic shock
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal pain and hypotension
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male was admitted in distributive shock 24 hours after a binge-drinking episode. Aggressive resuscitation was initiated for suspected perforated peptic ulcer, but laparotomy was negative; subsequent intraoperative transoesophageal echocardiography and CT confirmed a distal oesophageal rupture. He underwent emergency oesophagectomy and cervical oesophagostomy due to extensive tissue necrosis.

boerhaave_syndrome_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Boerhaave syndrome mimicking MI
  presenting_complaint: Crushing chest pain and diaphoresis
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male presented with symptoms highly suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome. After a normal ECG and negative serial troponins, a repeat history revealed the pain started immediately after a bout of coughing and retching. A Gastrografin swallow demonstrated a 2cm leak in the left lateral wall of the lower oesophagus, treated with an endoscopic covered metal stent.

boerhaave_syndrome_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Boerhaave syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Acute chest pain and neck swelling
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy with cyclic vomiting syndrome presented with sudden-onset cervical subcutaneous emphysema. Imaging confirmed a barogenic oesophageal perforation, a rare occurrence in this age group. He underwent successful primary suture repair and was discharged after a 14-day hospital stay.

boerhaave_syndrome_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Boerhaave syndrome with bilateral empyema
  presenting_complaint: Productive cough, dyspnoea, and rigors
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male presented with a one-week history of worsening respiratory symptoms initially treated as an exacerbation of COPD. CT revealed bilateral pleural collections and mediastinal gas; a delayed diagnosis of Boerhaave syndrome was made. Despite aggressive surgical drainage and antibiotics, he developed multi-organ failure and died on ICU.

boerhaave_syndrome_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Boerhaave syndrome post-seizure
  presenting_complaint: Post-ictal confusion and respiratory distress
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female with refractory epilepsy suffered a prolonged tonic-clonic seizure followed by forceful vomiting. Upon recovery, she complained of severe retrosternal pain; chest X-ray showed a new left pneumothorax. A diagnosis of Boerhaave syndrome was confirmed by CT, and she was successfully treated with a VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery) repair.

boerhaave_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Boerhaave syndrome with oesophagocutaneous fistula
  presenting_complaint: Persistent wound drainage after thoracic surgery
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male underwent primary repair for Boerhaave syndrome, but his recovery was complicated by a breakdown of the anastomosis. This resulted in a chronic oesophagocutaneous fistula presenting as saliva leaking from the chest drain site. He required long-term conservative management with an oesophageal stent and nutritional support via a RIG (Radiologically Inserted Gastrostomy) tube.

boerhaave_syndrome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Boerhaave syndrome (intramural haematoma)
  presenting_complaint: Mild dysphagia and mid-back pain
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female reported an episode of "something giving way" in her chest during intense retching. Endoscopy and CT showed a large intramural oesophageal haematoma but no frank extravasation of contrast into the mediastinum. She was monitored closely on the surgical ward with intravenous fluids and gradually transitioned to a soft diet over one week.

boerhaave_syndrome_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Boerhaave syndrome in a weightlifter
  presenting_complaint: Sudden neck pain and "crunching" sound when breathing
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male bodybuilder felt a sudden snap in his chest while performing a heavy squat (Valsalva manoeuvre). Examination revealed Hamman’s sign (systolic crunching sound) and palpable crepitus in the supraclavicular fossa. CT confirmed a mid-oesophageal barogenic rupture, which was managed surgically via a right thoracotomy.

boerhaave_syndrome_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Boerhaave syndrome with mediastinal abscess
  presenting_complaint: Odynophagia and swinging pyrexia
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male presented five days after an episode of food bolus obstruction followed by vomiting. Imaging identified a localised mediastinal abscess secondary to a distal oesophageal perforation. He underwent CT-guided percutaneous drainage of the collection and was kept NBM with parenteral nutrition for three weeks until the leak healed.

boerhaave_syndrome_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Boerhaave syndrome complicating hiatus hernia
  presenting_complaint: Severe retrosternal pain and haematemesis
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female with a known large para-oesophageal hernia presented with acute retching and coffee-ground emesis. Emergency CT showed the hernia had predisposed her to a transmural tear at the gastro-oesophageal junction. She underwent an emergency laparotomy, reduction of the hernia, and primary repair of the perforation with a Thal patch.

boerhaave_syndrome_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Necrotising mediastinitis secondary to Boerhaave
  presenting_complaint: Prostration, fever, and severe chest pain
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male presented in extremis 48 hours after an episode of forceful vomiting. CT showed extensive gas tracking throughout the mediastinum into the retroperitoneum. Despite emergency thoracotomy and aggressive debridement of necrotic tissues, the patient remained in refractory septic shock and succumbed to the illness.

boerhaave_syndrome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Boerhaave syndrome with pleural effusion amylase
  presenting_complaint: Left-sided chest pain and dyspnoea
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male with chronic alcohol excess presented with a two-day history of pleural pain. Diagnostic pleurocentesis was performed, showing a pleural fluid pH of 6.0 and an amylase level exceeding 2000 U/L. Contrast studies confirmed a Boerhaave rupture, and he was managed with an endoscopic stent and long-term pleural drainage.

boerhaave_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic-enhanced Boerhaave syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Sharp pain following vomiting and subsequent endoscopy
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male presented with vomiting-induced chest pain; an initial OGD (Oesophago-Gastro-Duodenoscopy) was performed to rule out a Mallory-Weiss tear but worsened the barogenic injury. Post-procedure CT showed a significant increase in pneumomediastinum. The patient required urgent surgical intervention to control the now-extensive distal oesophageal defect.

boerhaave_syndrome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Boerhaave syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Persistent cough and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male presented with a two-month history of coughing after drinking fluids. Imaging revealed an oesophagobronchial fistula that had developed following an unrecognised, self-limiting Boerhaave rupture weeks earlier. He required a complex surgical repair involving an intercostal muscle flap to separate the oesophageal and bronchial defects.

boerhaave_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening Boerhaave syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Agonising chest pain and cyanosis
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male presented within 2 hours of a vomiting episode with haemodynamic instability and surgical emphysema reaching the face. Rapid diagnosis via bedside ultrasound and CT led to immediate theatre for primary repair and wide mediastinal drainage. After a stormy 30-day ICU course involving tracheostomy and dialysis, he made a full recovery.
