fibromyalgia_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Fibromyalgia
  presenting_complaint: Chronic widespread pain and unrefreshing sleep.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female presented to her GP with a 2-year history of diffuse musculoskeletal pain, morning stiffness, and profound fatigue. Physical examination revealed multiple tender points without synovitis, and blood tests including ESR, CRP, and rheumatoid factor were normal. She was diagnosed with moderate fibromyalgia and commenced on low-dose amitriptyline and a graded exercise programme, resulting in a 30% improvement in symptom scores.

fibromyalgia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Juvenile fibromyalgia
  presenting_complaint: Widespread aches and school refusal.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old girl presented to paediatric rheumatology with a 6-month history of generalised pain, headaches, and abdominal discomfort. Investigations ruled out inflammatory arthritis and thyroid dysfunction. She was diagnosed with juvenile fibromyalgia; management focused on sleep hygiene, hydrotherapy, and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), allowing her to return to full-time education.

fibromyalgia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Fibromyalgia secondary to Osteoarthritis
  presenting_complaint: Worsening generalised pain despite joint replacement.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with known bilateral knee osteoarthritis reported that his pain had become "all over" following a successful total knee replacement. Clinical assessment identified central sensitisation features and widespread hyperalgesia inconsistent with his mechanical joint disease. He was diagnosed with secondary fibromyalgia and started on duloxetine, which helped manage both his neuropathic pain components and low mood.

fibromyalgia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic fibromyalgia flare
  presenting_complaint: Severe pain crisis following a minor road traffic accident.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female with pre-existing mild fibromyalgia presented to A&E with an acute exacerbation of pain (10/10) after a low-impact collision. Imaging showed no acute traumatic injury, but the patient was unable to mobilise due to severe allodynia. She was admitted for 48 hours for intensive physiotherapy and titration of pregabalin, eventually returning to her baseline pain levels after three weeks.

fibromyalgia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-viral fibromyalgia
  presenting_complaint: Myalgia and "brain fog" following glandular fever.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male developed persistent widespread muscle pain and cognitive difficulties six months after a laboratory-confirmed Epstein-Barr virus infection. Extensive investigations for post-viral fatigue syndrome and autoimmune markers were unremarkable. A diagnosis of post-viral fibromyalgia was made, and he was managed with a pacing strategy and low-dose naltrexone via a specialist pain clinic.

fibromyalgia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Fibromyalgia with comorbid Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)
  presenting_complaint: Diffuse pain associated with bloating and altered bowel habit.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female presented with a complex history of fibromyalgia, migraines, and IBS. Her symptoms fluctuated in tandem, suggesting a common underlying mechanism of central sensitisation. She was treated with a multidisciplinary approach involving a low FODMAP diet and gabapentin, which provided moderate relief of both gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal symptoms.

fibromyalgia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Treatment-resistant fibromyalgia
  presenting_complaint: Refractory widespread pain and severe functional impairment.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with a 10-year history of severe fibromyalgia failed to respond to amitriptyline, duloxetine, pregabalin, and several courses of CBT. Her symptoms led to medical retirement and significant social isolation. She was referred to a tertiary pain management centre for a multidisciplinary residential programme focusing on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and functional restoration.

fibromyalgia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Fibromyalgia in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Exacerbation of widespread pain in the second trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant female experienced a significant flare of her fibromyalgia symptoms at 24 weeks gestation. Management was challenging due to the need to avoid certain medications; she was managed with paracetamol, TENS machine therapy, and specialist obstetric physiotherapy. Her symptoms remained stable through delivery, though she required additional postnatal support for fatigue management.

fibromyalgia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Fibromyalgia
  presenting_complaint: Chronic back pain evolving into widespread myalgia.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male manual labourer initially presented with chronic low back pain, which over three years evolved into generalised pain affecting the neck, shoulders, and hips. Occupational health assessment confirmed he could no longer perform heavy lifting. He was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and transitioned to a sedentary role, supplemented by a community-based "Living Well with Pain" programme.

fibromyalgia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Fibromyalgia comorbid with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent pain despite biochemical remission of RA.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female with RA had a DAS28 score of 1.8 and normal CRP, yet complained of severe, widespread pain and fatigue. Clinical evaluation confirmed she met the ACR 2016 criteria for fibromyalgia alongside her well-controlled RA. The addition of a low-dose tricyclic antidepressant improved her sleep and reduced her perceived pain levels without changing her biologic DMARD regimen.

fibromyalgia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Fibromyalgia with comorbid PTSD
  presenting_complaint: Widespread pain and night terrors.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male veteran presented with chronic widespread pain and significant psychological distress. His history revealed a diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) following overseas service. A trauma-informed approach was used to treat his fibromyalgia, combining venlafaxine for both pain and anxiety with specialist psychological support, leading to improved functional capacity.

fibromyalgia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Early-stage fibromyalgia
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent diffuse pain and unrefreshing sleep.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old university student reported a 4-month history of "aching all over" during her final exams. Initial screens for anaemia, vitamin D deficiency, and thyroid dysfunction were negative. She was diagnosed with early-stage fibromyalgia and responded well to a structured sleep hygiene protocol and a return to regular swimming, preventing the progression to chronic disability.

fibromyalgia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Fibromyalgia with Small Fibre Neuropathy (SFN) features
  presenting_complaint: Burning skin sensations and widespread muscle aching.
  summary_of_course: A 47-year-old female presented with widespread pain and prominent distal burning sensations. While EMG and nerve conduction studies were normal, a skin punch biopsy showed reduced intraepidermal nerve fibre density, suggesting SFN. However, her overall clinical picture of fatigue and cognitive fog aligned with fibromyalgia, and she was managed with a combination of pregabalin and lifestyle modifications.

fibromyalgia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe fibromyalgia pain crisis
  presenting_complaint: Inability to walk due to intense, generalised pain.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female was admitted to the medical take with a "10/10" pain crisis, unable to tolerate the touch of clothing (severe allodynia). After excluding acute neurological and inflammatory causes, she was managed by the inpatient pain team with a short-term lidocaine infusion and intensive psychological support. She was discharged after 5 days with a revised community management plan.

fibromyalgia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Fibromyalgia with predominant cognitive dysfunction
  presenting_complaint: Severe "fibro-fog" and memory lapses.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old female presented primarily with concerns about her memory and concentration, alongside moderate widespread pain. Neuropsychological testing showed no evidence of dementia, but her symptoms correlated with poor sleep quality and fibromyalgia flares. Improving her sleep architecture with low-dose trazodone significantly enhanced her cognitive clarity and reduced her pain levels.

fibromyalgia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Fibromyalgia comorbid with Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder (HSD)
  presenting_complaint: Joint instability and widespread soft tissue pain.
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old female with a Beighton score of 7/9 presented with chronic widespread pain and frequent joint subluxations. The overlap of HSD and fibromyalgia made physiotherapy challenging; she required a highly specialised programme focusing on proprioception and core stability. Her pain was managed with a combination of myofascial release and low-dose topiramate.

fibromyalgia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Fibromyalgia with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA)
  presenting_complaint: Severe daytime somnolence and diffuse body aches.
  summary_of_course: A 53-year-old male with a BMI of 34 presented with classic fibromyalgia symptoms. A sleep study revealed moderate OSA (AHI of 22), which was exacerbating his fatigue and pain sensitivity. Treatment with CPAP significantly improved his daytime alertness, although he required additional pharmacological management for his persistent fibromyalgia-related widespread pain.

fibromyalgia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-surgical fibromyalgia
  presenting_complaint: Persistent, spreading pain following spinal surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old female underwent a successful lumbar discectomy, but post-operatively developed pain that spread to her upper limbs and torso. Investigations showed no surgical complications or nerve root impingement. She was diagnosed with post-surgical fibromyalgia, likely triggered by the physiological stress of surgery, and responded well to early intervention with a multidisciplinary pain rehabilitation programme.

fibromyalgia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Fibromyalgia mimicking Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR)
  presenting_complaint: Shoulder and hip girdle pain with morning stiffness.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female was initially treated for PMR with prednisolone, but her symptoms failed to improve despite a normal ESR. Further evaluation revealed widespread tender points and significant sleep disturbance, leading to a revised diagnosis of fibromyalgia. Prednisolone was tapered, and she was started on milnacipran, which provided much better symptom control.

fibromyalgia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory severe fibromyalgia
  presenting_complaint: Total functional collapse and bedbound status.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old female with a history of severe childhood trauma presented with a total inability to perform activities of daily living due to excruciating widespread pain. She was at risk of secondary complications including DVT and pressure sores due to immobility. A long-term, integrated psychiatric and pain management approach was required, including the use of ketamine infusions in a specialist setting to break the cycle of severe hyperalgesia.
