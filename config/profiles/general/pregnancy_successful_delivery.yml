  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding at 36 weeks
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old G1P0 presented with a woody-hard uterus and moderate antepartum haemorrhage.

  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic grade IV placenta praevia at 37 weeks
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old G2P1 with known major placenta praevia underwent a planned elective caesarean section. To minimize bleeding risk, a consultant-led multidisciplinary team performed the surgery, delivering a 3.0kg infant.
