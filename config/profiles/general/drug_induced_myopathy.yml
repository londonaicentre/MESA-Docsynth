drug_induced_myopathy_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS)
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral thigh myalgia and mild weakness
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male recently started on Simvastatin 40mg for hypercholesterolaemia presented with a two-week history of dull aching in the quadriceps. Clinical examination was unremarkable with 5/5 power, and serum creatine kinase (CK) was only marginally elevated at 250 IU/L. The statin was discontinued, leading to complete resolution of symptoms within ten days, confirming a mild drug-induced myalgia.

drug_induced_myopathy_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Statin-induced rhabdomyolysis
  presenting_complaint: Severe muscle pain, weakness, and dark-coloured urine
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old female on long-term Atorvastatin was prescribed Clarithromycin for a lower respiratory tract infection. Three days later, she developed profound proximal weakness and tea-coloured urine, with a CK level of 52,000 IU/L and acute kidney injury (creatinine 340 µmol/L). She was admitted to the ICU for aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation and temporary haemodialysis, with a diagnosis of drug-interaction-triggered rhabdomyolysis.

drug_induced_myopathy_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Anti-HMGCR immune-mediated necrotising myopathy
  presenting_complaint: Progressive proximal limb weakness despite stopping statins
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with a history of Rosuvastatin use developed subacute, symmetrical proximal muscle weakness that continued to worsen three months after drug cessation. Investigations revealed a CK of 8,000 IU/L and positive anti-HMG-CoA reductase antibodies. He required high-dose corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) to achieve clinical stabilisation and gradual improvement in power.

drug_induced_myopathy_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Corticosteroid-induced myopathy
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty rising from a chair and climbing stairs
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) had received multiple courses of high-dose Prednisolone over six months. She presented with insidious, painless pelvic girdle weakness and muscle wasting, while CK levels remained within the reference range. Electromyography (EMG) showed low-amplitude, short-duration motor unit potentials, and her symptoms improved following a steroid-sparing regimen and a structured physiotherapy programme.

drug_induced_myopathy_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Colchicine-induced neuromyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Generalised weakness and distal paraesthesia
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with chronic kidney disease (Stage 3b) was taking Colchicine 500mcg twice daily for gout prophylaxis. He presented with subacute proximal weakness and diminished deep tendon reflexes, with a CK elevation of 1,200 IU/L. Muscle biopsy showed vacuolar changes, and the diagnosis of colchicine toxicity was made; symptoms resolved four weeks after the medication was withdrawn.

drug_induced_myopathy_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Zidovudine-induced mitochondrial myopathy
  presenting_complaint: Chronic fatigue and proximal muscle wasting
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male with HIV on long-term Zidovudine (AZT) therapy reported a six-month history of progressive exercise intolerance and thigh thinning. Muscle biopsy demonstrated "ragged-red fibres" and cytochrome c oxidase-negative fibres, characteristic of mitochondrial toxicity. His antiretroviral regimen was switched to a Tenofovir-based protocol, resulting in a slow but steady recovery of muscle bulk and strength.

drug_induced_myopathy_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Amiodarone-induced vacuolar myopathy
  presenting_complaint: Proximal limb weakness and gait instability
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male treated with Amiodarone for refractory atrial fibrillation developed progressive difficulty walking over several months. Neurological examination showed Grade 4/5 proximal weakness and a fine tremor. Muscle biopsy revealed autophagic vacuoles and lysosomal inclusions; the weakness stabilised following a dose reduction and eventual transition to Dronedarone.

drug_induced_myopathy_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Daptomycin-induced myopathy
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic elevation of creatine kinase
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male hospitalised with MRSA endocarditis was commenced on high-dose Daptomycin (10mg/kg). Routine weekly monitoring revealed a sharp rise in CK from 110 IU/L to 2,800 IU/L on day 14, despite the patient being asymptomatic. The drug was immediately discontinued to prevent clinical myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, and CK levels returned to baseline within five days.

drug_induced_myopathy_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Cocaine-induced rhabdomyolysis
  presenting_complaint: Acute muscle pain, agitation, and hyperthermia
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male was brought to the Emergency Department following recreational cocaine use, presenting with severe muscle rigidity and a temperature of 39.5°C. Laboratory tests showed a CK of 115,000 IU/L, metabolic acidosis, and myoglobinuria. He was managed in the ICU with cooling measures, sedative infusions, and continuous veno-venous haemofiltration for life-threatening acute kidney injury.

drug_induced_myopathy_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Hydroxychloroquine-induced myopathy
  presenting_complaint: Slowly progressive weakness in the hip and shoulder girdles
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) on Hydroxychloroquine for eight years presented with a one-year history of worsening mobility. EMG demonstrated myopathic features with irritable discharges, and biopsy confirmed the presence of curvilinear bodies on electron microscopy. The medication was ceased, and she was transitioned to Mycophenolate Mofetil, with gradual improvement in her functional status over the following year.

drug_induced_myopathy_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute alcoholic necrotising myopathy
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of severe calf pain and swelling
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol excess presented after a heavy binge with exquisite tenderness and oedema in the lower limbs. CK was elevated at 18,000 IU/L, and ultrasound ruled out deep vein thrombosis. He was treated with intravenous thiamine and aggressive hydration, with the diagnosis of acute alcoholic "crush syndrome" or necrotising myopathy.

drug_induced_myopathy_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Pembrolizumab-induced myositis
  presenting_complaint: Drooping eyelids and neck weakness
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female receiving Pembrolizumab for metastatic melanoma developed acute ptosis and difficulty holding her head upright after the third cycle. Investigations showed a CK of 4,500 IU/L and positive troponin T, suggesting concurrent myocarditis. This immune-related adverse event (irAE) was treated with high-dose intravenous Methylprednisolone and Plasmapheresis, leading to a gradual recovery of muscle function.

drug_induced_myopathy_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Fibrate-statin interaction myopathy
  presenting_complaint: Diffuse myalgia and profound lethargy
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male on stable Rosuvastatin 20mg was started on Fenofibrate for persistent hypertriglyceridaemia. Within three weeks, he developed significant muscle tenderness and a CK rise to 6,500 IU/L. Both agents were temporarily withheld, and symptoms resolved; he was later successfully restarted on Rosuvastatin monotherapy at a lower dose without recurrence.

drug_induced_myopathy_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Licorice-induced hypokalaemic myopathy
  presenting_complaint: Acute flaccid paralysis of the limbs
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female presented with sudden onset inability to walk and profound weakness (power 2/5 globally). Investigations revealed severe hypokalaemia (K+ 1.7 mmol/L) and metabolic alkalosis; history revealed daily consumption of excessive amounts of natural black licorice. The secondary myopathy was treated with urgent potassium replacement, leading to a full recovery of motor function within 48 hours.

drug_induced_myopathy_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Omeprazole-induced subacute myopathy
  presenting_complaint: Proximal muscle aching and mild weakness
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male started on high-dose Omeprazole for GORD developed bilateral shoulder and hip girdle aching over four weeks. CK was moderately elevated at 1,400 IU/L, and an MRI of the thighs showed mild muscular oedema. Upon switching the proton pump inhibitor to Famotidine (an H2 antagonist), his symptoms and biochemical markers normalised within six weeks.

drug_induced_myopathy_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Penicillamine-induced polymyositis
  presenting_complaint: Symmetrical proximal weakness and dysphagia
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female with rheumatoid arthritis treated with D-Penicillamine developed a new-onset inflammatory myopathy. Clinical features included Grade 3/5 power in the deltoids and iliopsoas, elevated CK (3,200 IU/L), and biopsy findings indistinguishable from idiopathic polymyositis. The drug was discontinued, and a course of steroids was required to induce remission of the drug-induced inflammatory state.

drug_induced_myopathy_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Phenytoin-induced osteomalacic myopathy
  presenting_complaint: Waddling gait and bone pain
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male with long-term epilepsy on Phenytoin presented with chronic proximal leg weakness and a waddling gait. Laboratory results showed low calcium, low phosphate, and a very low Vitamin D level (12 nmol/L), with elevated alkaline phosphatase. The myopathy was attributed to Phenytoin-induced Vitamin D deficiency and subsequent osteomalacia; high-dose cholecalciferol supplementation resulted in complete resolution of the gait abnormality.

drug_induced_myopathy_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Quetiapine-induced rhabdomyolysis
  presenting_complaint: Muscle rigidity and collapse
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female was admitted following an intentional overdose of Quetiapine and Venlafaxine. She was found in a confused state with generalised muscle rigidity and a CK of 22,000 IU/L. Despite the absence of full neuroleptic malignant syndrome features, she was treated for drug-induced rhabdomyolysis with intensive fluid therapy and urinary alkalinisation, avoiding permanent renal damage.

drug_induced_myopathy_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Statin-unmasked McArdle disease
  presenting_complaint: Severe exercise-induced cramps and recurrent dark urine
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male with a history of mild exercise intolerance was started on Atorvastatin for familial hypercholesterolaemia, which triggered an episode of severe rhabdomyolysis (CK 45,000 IU/L). Subsequent genetic testing confirmed a homozygous mutation in the PYGM gene, diagnosing McArdle disease (GSD V). The statin acted as a metabolic stressor that unmasked the underlying genetic myopathy, and he was advised to avoid statins in the future.

drug_induced_myopathy_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic Cushingoid steroid myopathy
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty running and frequent falls
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy being treated with high-dose Dexamethasone for a posterior fossa tumour presented with significant proximal muscle wasting and a "Cushingoid" appearance. He struggled to jump or climb stairs, and physical therapy confirmed Grade 4/5 proximal power with normal CK. As the steroid dose was gradually tapered post-radiotherapy, his muscle strength and motor skills returned to age-appropriate levels.
