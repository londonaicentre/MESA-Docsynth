  primary_diagnosis: Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie’s syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal distension in a hospitalised patient
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old male recovering from a fractured neck of femur developed massive colonic distension. AXR showed dilatation of the caecum to 12cm with no mechanical obstruction on Gastrografin enema. He was successfully treated with intravenous neostigmine under cardiac monitoring.

intestinal_obstruction_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Faecal impaction causing large bowel obstruction
  presenting_complaint: Overflow diarrhoea and tenesmus
  summary_of_course: A 90-year-old bedbound female presented with paradoxical diarrhoea and lower abdominal discomfort. Digital rectal examination revealed hard, impacted stool in the rectum, and AXR showed a significant faecal burden throughout the colon. The obstruction was cleared through manual evacuation and a series of phosphate enemas.

intestinal_obstruction_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Internal hernia (Petersen’s space)
  presenting_complaint: Paroxysmal, severe epigastric pain and vomiting
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female with a previous Roux-en-Y gastric bypass presented with intermittent "boring" pain. CT showed a 'whirl sign' suggestive of mesenteric twisting. Emergency laparoscopy confirmed an internal hernia through the Petersen’s defect, which was reduced and the mesenteric gap closed.

intestinal_obstruction_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Meckel’s diverticulum with volvulus
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset periumbilical pain and haematochezia
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male presented with features of small bowel obstruction and minor lower GI bleeding. Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed a Meckel’s diverticulum acting as a lead point for a localized small bowel volvulus. He underwent a segmental small bowel resection and made an uncomplicated recovery.

intestinal_obstruction_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Trichobezoar causing gastric outlet obstruction
  presenting_complaint: Early satiety, foul-smelling breath, and epigastric mass
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old female with a history of trichotillomania presented with chronic upper abdominal pain. Imaging and endoscopy revealed a large hairball (trichobezoar) extending from the stomach into the duodenum (Rapunzel syndrome). The obstruction required removal via an open gastrotomy.

  primary_diagnosis: Chronic radiation enteritis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic bloating, malabsorption, and intermittent obstruction
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female who received pelvic radiotherapy for cervical cancer ten years prior presented with recurrent subacute obstruction. CT showed thickened, matted loops of small bowel within the pelvis. She was managed with a low-residue diet and occasional hospital admissions for conservative management of 'flare-ups'.

intestinal_obstruction_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Endometriosis-induced bowel obstruction
  presenting_complaint: Cyclical abdominal pain and constipation coinciding with menses
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old female with known endometriosis presented with symptoms of distal large bowel obstruction. MRI showed a deeply infiltrating endometriotic nodule involving the muscularis propria of the rectosigmoid colon. She underwent a joint gynaecological and colorectal resection of the affected segment.

  primary_diagnosis: Phytobezoar obstruction
  presenting_complaint: Acute small bowel obstruction after eating high-fibre fruit
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with a previous truncal vagotomy and pyloroplasty presented with sudden abdominal pain. CT identified an intraluminal mass in the distal ileum causing proximal dilatation. At surgery, a large phytobezoar composed of persimmon fibres was found and fragmented manually into the caecum.

intestinal_obstruction_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary small bowel volvulus
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, catastrophic abdominal pain and rapid clinical deterioration
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male with no prior surgical history presented in hypovolaemic shock with a rigid abdomen. CT showed a 'whirlpool' sign of the entire small bowel mesentery. Emergency laparotomy revealed a 360-degree primary volvulus; the bowel was detorsed and found to be viable after warm reperfusion.

intestinal_obstruction_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent adhesive obstruction failing conservative management
  presenting_complaint: Vomiting and inability to tolerate oral intake for 72 hours
