  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic bacteriuria detected at routine booking.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old pregnant female (14 weeks gestation) was found to have significant bacteriuria on routine screening despite being asymptomatic. To prevent progression to pyelonephritis, she was treated with a 7-day course of amoxicillin. Follow-up MSU at two weeks was clear, and she remained under surveillance throughout her pregnancy.

cystitis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Radiation cystitis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent haematuria and dysuria two years post-radiotherapy.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male previously treated with pelvic radiotherapy for prostate adenocarcinoma presented with chronic bladder irritation. Cystoscopy showed telangiectatic vessels and friable mucosa consistent with late radiation effects. He was managed with hyperbaric oxygen therapy and bladder instillations of alum to control bleeding.

cystitis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Cystitis with secondary pyelonephritis
  presenting_complaint: Dysuria followed by acute onset of loin pain and vomiting.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female initially ignored mild cystitis symptoms for four days before developing a fever of 38.8°C and right-sided costovertebral angle tenderness. Bloods showed a CRP of 145 mg/L and leucocytosis. She was admitted for IV fluids and IV cefuroxime for 48 hours before stepping down to oral ciprofloxacin to complete 10 days.

cystitis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) cystitis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent dysuria despite two courses of standard antibiotics.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female with a history of frequent travel to South Asia presented with ongoing UTI symptoms. Initial treatment with nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim failed; MSU culture eventually identified an ESBL-producing E. coli. Based on sensitivities, she was successfully treated with a 7-day course of oral pivmecillinam.

cystitis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Fungal cystitis
  presenting_complaint: Cloudy urine and mild suprapubic discomfort in an immunocompromised patient.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male on long-term corticosteroids for SLE presented with persistent urinary symptoms. Urine microscopy revealed yeast cells and culture grew Candida albicans. He was treated with oral fluconazole 200mg daily for 14 days, and his pre-existing catheter was removed to eliminate the nidus of infection.

cystitis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Cystitis in an elderly patient (Atypical presentation)
  presenting_complaint: New-onset confusion, falls, and loss of appetite.
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old female was brought to A&E following a fall; she had no localising urinary symptoms but was acutely confused (delirium). Urine dipstick was positive for nitrites, and MSU grew E. coli. Her delirium resolved within 72 hours of starting oral co-amoxiclav, confirming the urinary tract as the source of sepsis.

  primary_diagnosis: Cystitis due to Staphylococcus saprophyticus
  presenting_complaint: Severe dysuria and haematuria shortly after becoming sexually active.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female presented with "honeymoon cystitis" symptoms. Culture grew S. saprophyticus, a common pathogen in this demographic. She responded rapidly to a 3-day course of nitrofurantoin and was advised on post-coital voiding to prevent recurrence.

cystitis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Cystitis in a renal transplant recipient
  presenting_complaint: Low-grade fever and graft tenderness.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male, two years post-renal transplant, presented with mild urinary symptoms and a rise in serum creatinine. Ultrasound of the graft was unremarkable, but urine culture grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa. He required hospital admission for IV ceftazidime to protect the graft and ensure clearance of the infection.

cystitis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Schistosomal cystitis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic terminal haematuria and pelvic pain.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male who recently emigrated from Malawi presented with long-standing urinary discomfort.
