testicular_hypofunction_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Klinefelter Syndrome (47,XXY)
  presenting_complaint: Delayed puberty and tall stature.
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old male presented to the paediatric endocrine clinic with lack of secondary sexual characteristics and disproportionately long limbs. Physical examination revealed small, firm testes (2ml volume) and gynaecomastia. Karyotype confirmed 47,XXY, and biochemistry showed low serum testosterone with markedly elevated LH and FSH, necessitating the initiation of testosterone enanthate injections.

testicular_hypofunction_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Late-onset Hypogonadism
  presenting_complaint: Low libido, erectile dysfunction, and fatigue.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with Type 2 diabetes and hypertension reported a progressive decline in sexual function and persistent lethargy over 18 months. Morning fasted testosterone levels were consistently low (7.2 nmol/L) with a mildly elevated LH. Following lifestyle modifications and optimisation of glycaemic control, he was started on topical testosterone gel, resulting in significant improvement in mood and energy levels.

testicular_hypofunction_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary Hypogonadism due to Pituitary Adenoma
  presenting_complaint: Persistent headaches and bitemporal hemianopia.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented with visual disturbances and loss of morning erections. MRI brain identified a 2.5cm pituitary macroadenoma compressing the optic chiasm. Biochemical screening confirmed panhypopituitarism including secondary testicular hypofunction (low testosterone with inappropriately low LH/FSH), requiring urgent transsphenoidal resection and subsequent hormone replacement therapy.

testicular_hypofunction_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Anabolic-Androgenic Steroid (AAS) Induced Hypogonadism
  presenting_complaint: Infertility and testicular shrinkage.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male bodybuilder presented to the fertility clinic after failing to conceive with his partner for two years. He admitted to long-term misuse of parenteral testosterone and trenbolone. Semen analysis showed azoospermia, and bloods revealed profound suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis; he was managed with AAS cessation and a course of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to stimulate endogenous production.

testicular_hypofunction_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-mumps Orchitis Atrophy
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral testicular smallness and infertility.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male presented with a history of severe bilateral mumps orchitis during his early twenties. Clinical examination noted significant bilateral testicular atrophy (5ml bilaterally). Endocrine profiling confirmed hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, and he was referred for sperm retrieval techniques and testosterone replacement to prevent osteoporosis.

testicular_hypofunction_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Kallmann Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Absence of puberty and inability to smell (anosmia).
  summary_of_course: An 18-year-old male was referred for investigation of delayed puberty. He reported never having developed a sense of smell. Investigations showed prepubertal testosterone levels and low gonadotropins, while MRI confirmed absent olfactory bulbs, leading to a diagnosis of Kallmann syndrome and the initiation of pulsatile GnRH therapy to induce puberty and future fertility.

testicular_hypofunction_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Hereditary Haemochromatosis
  presenting_complaint: Joint pain, skin bronzing, and loss of libido.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented with features of iron overload. Investigations revealed a high transferrin saturation and ferritin >2000 ng/mL, with genetic testing positive for HFE mutations. His secondary testicular hypofunction was attributed to iron deposition in the anterior pituitary, managed with regular venesection and testosterone supplementation.

testicular_hypofunction_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Chemotherapy-induced Testicular Failure
  presenting_complaint: Hot flushes and low mood following cancer treatment.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male, six months post-BEP chemotherapy for a non-seminomatous germ cell tumour, reported symptoms of androgen deficiency. Serum testosterone was 5.8 nmol/L with elevated FSH, indicating irreversible damage to the germinal epithelium and Leydig cells. He was commenced on long-acting testosterone undecanoate injections.

testicular_hypofunction_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Opioid-Induced Androgen Deficiency (OPIAD)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic fatigue and sexual dysfunction.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male on high-dose oral morphine for chronic back pain following a spinal injury presented with symptoms of hypogonadism. Laboratory tests showed suppressed LH and low testosterone (6.1 nmol/L). After a multidisciplinary review, his opioid dose was tapered where possible, and he was started on transdermal testosterone to alleviate symptoms.

testicular_hypofunction_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Bilateral Testicular Torsion (Anorchism)
  presenting_complaint: Prepubertal status at age 15.
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old male with a history of neonatal bilateral testicular torsion resulting in orchidectomy presented for pubertal induction. He had no palpable testicular tissue. Baseline biochemistry confirmed hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (FSH 85 IU/L), and he was successfully transitioned through puberty using a graduated testosterone replacement protocol.

testicular_hypofunction_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Obesity-Related Secondary Hypogonadism
  presenting_complaint: Excessive tiredness and low sex drive.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male with a BMI of 46 kg/m2 and obstructive sleep apnoea presented with symptoms of low testosterone. Initial bloods showed a total testosterone of 8.2 nmol/L but a normal LH, suggesting functional hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Management focused on intensive weight loss and CPAP therapy, which resulted in a partial recovery of endogenous testosterone levels.

testicular_hypofunction_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (PAIS)
  presenting_complaint: Gynaecomastia and hypospadias.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male with a history of childhood hypospadias repair presented with significant breast development and poor virilisation. Despite elevated serum testosterone levels, he exhibited signs of androgen deficiency due to receptor resistance. Genetic testing confirmed an AR gene mutation, and management involved surgical correction of gynaecomastia and high-dose androgen therapy to overcome partial resistance.

testicular_hypofunction_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Noonan Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Short stature and undescended testes.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy with characteristic facial features and a history of pulmonary valve stenosis was evaluated for cryptorchidism. Despite orchidopexy, his testes remained small and dysgenetic. Endocrine monitoring during adolescence revealed rising FSH and failing testosterone production, consistent with primary testicular hypofunction associated with Noonan syndrome.

testicular_hypofunction_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Traumatic Testicular Atrophy
  presenting_complaint: Scrotal emptiness and androgen deficiency symptoms.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old veteran who sustained a blast injury resulting in severe pelvic trauma and bilateral testicular rupture ten years prior. He presented with worsening osteoporosis on DXA scan and low energy. Having previously declined hormone therapy, he was now started on testosterone replacement to manage bone density and metabolic health.

testicular_hypofunction_015:
  primary_diagnosis: HIV-Associated Hypogonadism
  presenting_complaint: Unexplained weight loss and muscle wasting.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male with long-standing HIV on stable ART presented with significant sarcopenia. Investigations ruled out opportunistic infections but identified secondary hypogonadism (testosterone 7.5 nmol/L, low-normal LH). He was treated with testosterone replacement as part of a comprehensive metabolic rehabilitation programme, showing improvement in lean body mass.

testicular_hypofunction_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Cirrhosis-induced Testicular Hypofunction
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal swelling and loss of body hair.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B) presented with ascites and gynaecomastia. Clinical examination revealed small, soft testes. Biochemistry showed low total testosterone and elevated oestradiol due to peripheral aromatisation and reduced hepatic clearance, requiring cautious management of his liver disease alongside endocrine support.

testicular_hypofunction_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Hyperprolactinaemia-induced Hypogonadism
  presenting_complaint: Galactorrhoea (rare in males) and erectile dysfunction.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male on Risperidone for schizophrenia presented with sexual dysfunction and milky nipple discharge. Prolactin was significantly elevated (2500 mIU/L), which suppressed the HPG axis leading to low testosterone. In consultation with psychiatry, his medication was switched to Aripiprazole, which normalised prolactin and restored gonadal function.

testicular_hypofunction_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Prader-Willi Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Morbid obesity and hypogonadism.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy with Prader-Willi syndrome was monitored for cryptorchidism and delayed development. His condition is characterised by hypothalamic dysfunction leading to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. He was scheduled for human chorionic gonadotropin treatment to assist with testicular descent and planned for testosterone therapy at the appropriate pubertal age.

testicular_hypofunction_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Sertoli-Cell-Only Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Primary infertility.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male presented with azoospermia. Physical examination showed normal secondary sexual characteristics but slightly reduced testicular volume. While his testosterone levels were within the low-normal range, his FSH was markedly elevated (22 IU/L), and testicular biopsy confirmed the absence of germ cells, diagnostic of Sertoli-cell-only syndrome.

testicular_hypofunction_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Critical Illness-Induced Hypogonadism
  presenting_complaint: Severe sepsis and multi-organ failure.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with urosepsis and septic shock. During his prolonged stay, endocrine profiling performed due to persistent anaemia showed a profound drop in testosterone (2.1 nmol/L) with low LH. This was interpreted as transient secondary hypofunction due to critical illness; his levels spontaneously recovered three months post-discharge without specific hormonal intervention.
