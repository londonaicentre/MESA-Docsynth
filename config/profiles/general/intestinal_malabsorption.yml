She commenced a strict gluten-free diet with significant improvement in haemoglobin levels and energy within six months.

intestinal_malabsorption_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Short bowel syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Profuse watery diarrhoea and rapid weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male underwent extensive small bowel resection (leaving 60cm) following a superior mesenteric artery infarct. He developed severe malabsorption and electrolyte imbalances requiring long-term parenteral nutrition. Management involves high-dose proton pump inhibitors, antimotility agents, and careful monitoring of micronutrient levels.

intestinal_malabsorption_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Tropical sprue
  presenting_complaint: Chronic diarrhoea and megaloblastic anaemia
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male returned from a year-long trip to Southeast Asia with persistent fatty stools and 10kg weight loss. Investigations revealed low B12 and folate levels with partial villous atrophy on biopsy. He was treated with a long course of tetracycline and folic acid, resulting in complete resolution of symptoms.

intestinal_malabsorption_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal bloating and steatorrhoea
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female with a history of scleroderma presented with worsening post-prandial bloating and greasy stools. A glucose hydrogen breath test was positive for SIBO. She was treated with a rotating course of Rifaximin and Metronidazole, which successfully reduced her symptoms and improved her Vitamin D status.

intestinal_malabsorption_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Crohn's disease of the small bowel
  presenting_complaint: Right lower quadrant pain and Vitamin B12 deficiency
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female presented with subacute intestinal obstruction and macrocytic anaemia. MRI enterography showed terminal ileal thickening and stricturing over 15cm. She was diagnosed with fistulating Crohn's disease and commenced on adalimumab, requiring regular B12 injections due to ileal malabsorption.

intestinal_malabsorption_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory coeliac disease type II
  presenting_complaint: Persistent malabsorption despite gluten-free diet
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with known coeliac disease failed to improve after two years on a strict gluten-free diet. Repeat biopsy showed persistent villous atrophy with an aberrant T-cell population (clonal TCR rearrangement). He was started on prednisolone and azathioprine to manage the high risk of progression to enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma.

intestinal_malabsorption_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Radiation enteritis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic diarrhoea and pelvic pain
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female who received pelvic radiotherapy for cervical cancer five years ago presented with chronic malabsorptive diarrhoea. Investigations confirmed chronic radiation enteritis with bile acid malabsorption. She was managed with Sequestrants (Colestyramine) and low-fat dietary modifications to control her symptoms.

intestinal_malabsorption_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Giardiasis
  presenting_complaint: Foul-smelling flatulence and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old hiker presented with three weeks of explosive, greasy diarrhoea after drinking stream water. Stool microscopy and antigen testing confirmed Giardia lamblia infection. A single dose of tinidazole resolved the infection, and her nutritional markers returned to baseline within weeks.

intestinal_malabsorption_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) enteropathy
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent respiratory infections and chronic diarrhoea
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male with a history of recurrent pneumonia presented with weight loss and protein-losing enteropathy. Blood tests showed profound hypogammaglobulinaemia, and biopsy showed villous atrophy lacking plasma cells. He was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) replacement, which improved both his immune status and gastrointestinal symptoms.

intestinal_malabsorption_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Bile acid malabsorption (Type 2 - Idiopathic)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic watery diarrhoea for several years
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female presented with lifelong urgency and watery diarrhoea, often misdiagnosed as IBS-D. A SeHCAT scan showed 4% retention at seven days, confirming severe bile acid malabsorption. She experienced a dramatic improvement in stool consistency and frequency after starting colesevelam.

intestinal_malabsorption_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Abetalipoproteinaemia
  presenting_complaint: Steatorrhoea and failure to thrive in infancy
  summary_of_course: An 18-month-old boy presented with severe fat malabsorption and developmental delay. Blood film showed acanthocytosis and very low serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels. He was started on a low-fat diet supplemented with high-dose fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) to prevent neurological and retinal complications.

intestinal_malabsorption_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Eosinophilic enteritis
  presenting_complaint: Post-prandial abdominal pain and peripheral eosinophilia
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with a history of asthma presented with intermittent vomiting and weight loss. Full blood count showed significant eosinophilia, and biopsy of the small intestine showed >50 eosinophils per high-power field. He responded well to an elemental diet followed by a tapered course of oral budesonide.

intestinal_malabsorption_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Amyloidosis (Systemic AL)
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss and pseudo-obstruction
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with plasma cell dyscrasia presented with severe weight loss and symptoms of intestinal dysmotility. Endoscopic biopsies with Congo red staining confirmed amyloid deposition in the submucosa. Management was palliative, focusing on nutritional support and treating the underlying haematological malignancy.

intestinal_malabsorption_015:
  primary_diagnosis: HIV enteropathy
  presenting_complaint: Chronic wasting and diarrhoea
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male with poorly controlled HIV (CD4 count <100) presented with severe cachexia and non-specific chronic diarrhoea. Extensive testing for opportunistic infections was negative, suggesting direct HIV-mediated mucosal damage. Initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) led to gradual weight gain and resolution of diarrhoea.

intestinal_malabsorption_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Mesenteric ischaemia (Chronic)
  presenting_complaint: Post-prandial "abdominal angina" and food fear
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old smoker presented with 15kg weight loss because eating caused severe epigastric pain. CT angiography revealed significant stenosis of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries. Following mesenteric artery stenting, his pain resolved, and he was able to resume a normal diet and regain weight.

intestinal_malabsorption_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Lymphangiectasia (Primary)
  presenting_complaint: Lower limb oedema and chronic diarrhoea
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old girl presented with bilateral leg swelling and low serum albumin. Lymphoscintigraphy and endoscopy revealed dilated intestinal lymphatics and protein-losing enteropathy. She was placed on a high-protein, very low-fat diet with medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) supplementation to bypass the lymphatic system.

intestinal_malabsorption_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Multiple peptic ulcers and steatorrhoea
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male presented with recurrent duodenal ulcers and large-volume diarrhoea. High gastrin levels and a positive secretin stimulation test confirmed a gastrinoma. The malabsorption was caused by low intestinal pH inactivating pancreatic enzymes; symptoms improved significantly with high-dose omeprazole and surgical resection of the tumour.

intestinal_malabsorption_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Dermatitis herpetiformis with occult coeliac disease
  presenting_complaint: Extremely itchy, blistering rash on elbows and knees
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male presented to dermatology with a chronic pruritic rash. Skin biopsy showed granular IgA deposits, and subsequent duodenal biopsy confirmed subtotal villous atrophy despite minimal GI symptoms. Both the rash and the underlying intestinal malabsorption resolved on a lifelong gluten-free diet and a short course of dapsone.

intestinal_malabsorption_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Hartnup disease
  presenting_complaint: Pellagra-like skin rash and cerebellar ataxia
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old boy presented with a photosensitive rash and intermittent unsteadiness. Investigations revealed neutral aminoaciduria due to defective intestinal and renal transport of tryptophan. He was treated with high-protein diet and nicotinamide supplementation, which led to a significant improvement in his skin and neurological symptoms.
