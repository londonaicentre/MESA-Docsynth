  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male with 30% Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) flame burns developed sudden pyrexia and graft loss on day 12. Wound swabs and blood cultures grew multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Treatment required aggressive surgical debridement and a combination of IV colistin and amikacin based on sensitivities.

  presenting_complaint: Persistent cough, high fever, and reduced breath sounds.
  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old girl presented one week after a viral prodrome with worsening respiratory distress and a CRP of 310 mg/L. Ultrasound confirmed a large loculated pleural effusion, which was drained, yielding pus positive for Staphylococcus aureus. She required a chest drain and a three-week course of IV antibiotics before transitioning to oral therapy.
