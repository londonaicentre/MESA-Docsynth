erythema_multiforme_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Erythema multiforme minor
  presenting_complaint: Target-like rash on hands and forearms
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male presented with a 2-day history of symmetrical, itchy, targetoid lesions on the dorsal hands following a labial herpes simplex outbreak. Clinical examination confirmed classic three-zoned iris lesions with no mucosal involvement. He was treated with topical clobetasol butyrate and oral cetirizine, with complete resolution within 10 days.

erythema_multiforme_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Erythema multiforme major
  presenting_complaint: Widespread rash and painful mouth ulcers
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old girl was admitted with a high fever, cough, and progressive blistering of the lips and oral mucosa. Investigations revealed Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM positivity and chest X-ray changes consistent with atypical pneumonia. She was managed with intravenous fluids, clarithromycin, and supportive mouth care, showing significant improvement over one week.

erythema_multiforme_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent erythema multiforme
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of circular skin lesions
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old female reported five episodes of acral target lesions over the past year, each occurring 10 days after a genital herpes flare. Despite episodic aciclovir, the EM persisted, necessitating a transition to long-term suppressive valaciclovir 500mg daily. This regimen successfully reduced the frequency and severity of the cutaneous eruptions.

erythema_multiforme_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Drug-induced erythema multiforme
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of blistering rash after starting new medication
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male developed atypical targetoid plaques and haemorrhagic crusting of the lips 5 days after commencing naproxen for osteoarthritis. Skin biopsy demonstrated interface dermatitis with necrotic keratinocytes consistent with EM. The NSAID was discontinued, and he was treated with a tapering dose of oral prednisolone, leading to gradual healing.

erythema_multiforme_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Erythema multiforme in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Pruritic target lesions during second trimester
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old pregnant woman (24 weeks gestation) presented with a sudden eruption of target lesions on her palms and soles. Extensive screening for HSV and Mycoplasma was negative, suggesting an idiopathic trigger. Management was conservative with mild topical corticosteroids and antihistamines, ensuring no adverse impact on the foetal growth or maternal health.

erythema_multiforme_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe erythema multiforme major
  presenting_complaint: Extensive skin sloughing and multi-mucosal involvement
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old male was admitted to the HDU with EM major involving the oral, ocular, and urogenital mucosa, covering 8% of his body surface area. Differentiating from Stevens-Johnson Syndrome was challenging, but the presence of distinct targetoid morphology supported EM. He required nasogastric feeding and intensive ophthalmology review for pseudomembranous conjunctivitis, eventually recovering with systemic steroids.

erythema_multiforme_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-vaccination erythema multiforme
  presenting_complaint: Red rings on limbs following immunisation
  summary_of_course: A 14-month-old boy developed multiple erythematous "bullseye" lesions on his legs 4 days after receiving his MMR vaccine. The child remained systemically well and afebrile, with the rash remaining confined to the extremities. The GP diagnosed post-vaccination EM minor, and the lesions spontaneously regressed over two weeks without intervention.

erythema_multiforme_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic persistent erythema multiforme
  presenting_complaint: Non-resolving targetoid plaques for six months
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented with a rare chronic variant of EM, exhibiting continuous targetoid lesions for over 180 days without a clear trigger. Extensive workup for malignancy, connective tissue disease, and occult infection was unremarkable. She failed to respond to dapsone but achieved partial control with azathioprine 100mg daily as a steroid-sparing agent.

erythema_multiforme_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Erythema multiforme major with ocular complications
  presenting_complaint: Red, painful eyes and skin targets
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with EM major secondary to HSV-2 developed severe bilateral conjunctival injection and corneal erosions. Despite resolving skin lesions, he suffered from persistent photophobia and decreased visual acuity. Aggressive treatment with topical ciclosporin and lubricants was required to prevent the formation of symblepharon.

erythema_multiforme_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Atypical bullous erythema multiforme
  presenting_complaint: Large blisters on a background of target lesions
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old HIV-positive male presented with extensive bullae formation on his extremities, initially mimicking bullous pemphigoid. Histopathology and direct immunofluorescence confirmed a diagnosis of bullous EM, likely triggered by a recent upper respiratory tract infection. He was treated with a short course of oral steroids and optimisation of his antiretroviral therapy.

erythema_multiforme_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Erythema multiforme mimicking SJS
  presenting_complaint: Fever and widespread dusky red patches
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old woman taking phenobarbital presented with confluent dusky macules and focal epidermal detachment. While clinically suspicious for SJS, the presence of typical targets on the acral sites and biopsy findings of dense lymphocytic infiltrate favoured a diagnosis of severe EM. The offending drug was ceased, and she was managed in the regional burns unit for wound care.

erythema_multiforme_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent erythema multiforme (treatment failure)
  presenting_complaint: Breakthrough skin lesions despite antiviral prophylaxis
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female with a 5-year history of EM continued to experience monthly flares despite 1g of valaciclovir daily. Viral swabs of the prodromal oral lesions confirmed aciclovir-resistant HSV-1. Treatment was switched to foscarnet for the acute flare, and mycophenolate mofetil was introduced for long-term immunomodulation.

erythema_multiforme_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Orf-induced erythema multiforme
  presenting_complaint: Large nodule on finger and widespread target rash
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old sheep farmer presented with a haemorrhagic nodule on his right index finger (Orf) followed 10 days later by a classic EM minor eruption. The EM was a secondary immunological reaction to the parapoxvirus infection. Both the primary Orf lesion and the EM rash resolved spontaneously with simple dressings and reassurance.

erythema_multiforme_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-radiotherapy erythema multiforme
  presenting_complaint: Target lesions localised to radiation field
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old woman undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer developed EM lesions specifically confined to the irradiated skin (isomorphic response). The rash later generalised to the contralateral breast and limbs. Radiotherapy was briefly paused, and topical steroids were applied, allowing for the completion of her oncological treatment once the skin stabilised.

erythema_multiforme_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Erythema multiforme major with neurological involvement
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, headache, and blistering rash
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old boy presented with EM major and signs of encephalitis, including altered consciousness. PCR of the cerebrospinal fluid and throat swabs were positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. He received intravenous azithromycin and high-dose methylprednisolone, resulting in a full neurological recovery and gradual clearing of the cutaneous and mucosal lesions.

erythema_multiforme_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Drug-induced erythema multiforme in the elderly
  presenting_complaint: Widespread targets in a patient with polypharmacy
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with heart failure and CKD stage 4 developed EM after the introduction of allopurinol. Due to his renal impairment, systemic steroid use was cautious, and he was monitored closely for fluid overload. The allopurinol was identified as the culprit and withdrawn, with the rash resolving over three weeks.

erythema_multiforme_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic erythema multiforme minor
  presenting_complaint: Sudden appearance of "spots" on palms and ears
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female university student presented with a 3-day history of asymptomatic targetoid lesions on her palms and helix of the ears. No viral prodrome or new medications were identified. The diagnosis of idiopathic EM minor was made, and the patient was managed expectantly with the rash fading without scarring.

erythema_multiforme_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe oral erythema multiforme
  presenting_complaint: Inability to swallow due to mouth pain
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old girl presented with isolated, severe oral and labial ulceration with characteristic haemorrhagic crusting, but no skin lesions. Initially misdiagnosed as primary herpetic gingivostomatitis, the lack of response to aciclovir and subsequent appearance of two target lesions on the knees confirmed EM major. She required IV rehydration and topical lidocaine for pain management.

erythema_multiforme_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Erythema multiforme with secondary infection
  presenting_complaint: Infected, weeping skin lesions and fever
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male with EM minor secondary to HSV-1 developed secondary Staphylococcus aureus infection of the targetoid plaques. He presented with increased pain, purulent discharge, and spreading erythema (cellulitis). He required a course of oral flucloxacillin alongside his EM treatment to resolve the superimposed bacterial infection.

erythema_multiforme_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild erythema multiforme minor
  presenting_complaint: Faint rings on the back of the hands
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old male presented to his GP with a few mildly itchy, concentric rings on his knuckles following a mild "cold." He was otherwise systemicially well with no mucosal involvement. The GP diagnosed mild EM minor and prescribed aqueous cream with 1% menthol for symptomatic relief; the lesions disappeared within a week.
