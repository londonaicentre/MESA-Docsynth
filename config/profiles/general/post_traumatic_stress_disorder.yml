  primary_diagnosis: "Acute-on-chronic PTSD with Hospital-Triggered Flashbacks"
  presenting_complaint: "Extreme agitation, disorientation, and shouting about 'the Blitz' during ward admission."
  summary_of_course: "An 88-year-old female, hospitalised for a fractured neck of femur, experienced severe acute distress triggered by the sound of hospital sirens. History revealed repressed trauma from the London Blitz, exacerbated by the clinical environment and post-operative delirium. Low-dose Quetiapine was used for acute agitation alongside psychological bridging work. She was eventually stabilised and discharged to a quiet residential care setting."

post_traumatic_stress_disorder_004:
  primary_diagnosis: "Post-Intensive Care Syndrome with PTSD"
  presenting_complaint: "Flashbacks of 'being tortured' and panic attacks when entering the hospital grounds."
  summary_of_course: "A 45-year-old male presented to the ICU follow-up clinic six months after surviving septic shock and a 20-day intubation period. He described vivid, distorted memories of medical procedures as intentional assaults. Screening tools indicated moderate PTSD and comorbid depression. He was enrolled in an ICU recovery programme involving gradual exposure and EMDR, showing moderate improvement in six months."

  primary_diagnosis: "Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD)"
  presenting_complaint: "Severe emotional dysregulation, persistent feelings of worthlessness, and interpersonal instability."
  summary_of_course: "A 29-year-old female with a history of prolonged childhood domestic neglect presented to community mental health services. She met ICD-11 criteria for C-PTSD, exhibiting the core PTSD triad plus disturbances in self-organisation. Treatment involved a multi-phase stabilisation approach including Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) skills before commencing trauma processing. Progress has been slow, with frequent crises requiring home treatment team involvement."

  presenting_complaint: "Anxiety while driving and occasional intrusive thoughts about a minor collision."
  summary_of_course: "A 22-year-old female student sought help four months after a low-speed RTA. While she maintained daily functioning, she experienced heightened startle responses and avoided the motorway where the accident occurred. She was referred to NHS Talking Therapies for guided self-help and four sessions of CBT. Her symptoms resolved completely within three months, and she resumed normal driving habits."

post_traumatic_stress_disorder_007:
  primary_diagnosis: "Severe PTSD with High Suicide Risk"
  presenting_complaint: "Intense suicidal ideation, total insomnia, and 'reliving' a violent assault."
  summary_of_course: "A 40-year-old male was admitted to an acute psychiatric ward following a near-lethal overdose. He had witnessed a stabbing three weeks prior and developed rapid-onset, life-threatening PTSD symptoms. He was started on Mirtazapine for sleep and Venlafaxine for mood, alongside intensive 1-to-1 nursing observations. After four weeks of inpatient stabilisation, he transitioned to a day hospital trauma programme."

post_traumatic_stress_disorder_008:
  primary_diagnosis: "Occupational PTSD in First Responders"
  presenting_complaint: "Emotional numbing, burnout, and irritability at work."
  summary_of_course: "A 50-year-old male paramedic with 25 years of service presented with cumulative trauma. He reported a 'shutter going down' on his emotions and significant strain in his marriage. Occupational health assessment confirmed chronic PTSD related to multiple fatalities witnessed over his career. He was granted a period of sick leave and commenced Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR), leading to a phased return to non-frontline duties."

  presenting_complaint: "Fear of holding her baby and intrusive images of the delivery room."
  summary_of_course: "A 34-year-old primiparous woman experienced a traumatic grade 1 emergency Caesarean section due to foetal distress. Postnatally, she exhibited avoidance of the infant and panic attacks when passing the maternity unit. The perinatal mental health team diagnosed PTSD and provided specialist TF-CBT. Her bonding with the infant improved significantly as her re-experiencing symptoms diminished over 16 weeks."

post_traumatic_stress_disorder_010:
  primary_diagnosis: "PTSD presenting with Somatisation"
  presenting_complaint: "Chronic non-cardiac chest pain, palpitations, and unexplained gastrointestinal distress."
  summary_of_course: "A 55-year-old male underwent extensive cardiac and GI investigations, all of which were unremarkable. A detailed psychiatric history eventually revealed a dormant history of physical assault ten years prior, recently triggered by a local news report. His physical symptoms were identified as somatic manifestations of PTSD-related autonomic arousal. Treatment with Propranolol and trauma-focused therapy led to a 70% reduction in physical complaints."

post_traumatic_stress_disorder_011:
  primary_diagnosis: "PTSD with Comorbid Alcohol Dependence"
  presenting_complaint: "Heavy daily drinking to 'drown out' memories of a sexual assault."
  summary_of_course: "A 26-year-old female presented to addiction services with escalating alcohol use (40 units/week). She disclosed a history of sexual violence and used alcohol as a maladaptive coping mechanism for nightmares. A dual-diagnosis approach was utilised, combining medically supervised detoxification with subsequent trauma therapy. She has maintained six months of sobriety while continuing outpatient psychological support."

With the aid of an interpreter, he received culturally adapted CBT and social support for housing. His hypervigilance decreased, though his recovery is complicated by ongoing uncertainty regarding his immigration status."

post_traumatic_stress_disorder_013:
  primary_diagnosis: "Treatment-Resistant Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder"
  presenting_complaint: "Persistent flashbacks and total social isolation despite multiple previous therapies."
  summary_of_course: "A 38-year-old female remained severely symptomatic after full courses of both TF-CBT and EMDR, and trials of three different SSRIs. Her history involved multiple childhood traumas and adult domestic violence. A tertiary referral centre recommended a combination of Venlafaxine and low-dose Risperidone as an adjunct. While she remains unable to work, her 'flashback frequency' has reduced from daily to twice weekly."

post_traumatic_stress_disorder_014:
  primary_diagnosis: "Late-Onset PTSD"
  presenting_complaint: "New-onset anxiety and vivid memories of a 50-year-old industrial accident."
  summary_of_course: "An 82-year-old male presented with distressing memories of a mine collapse from his youth, triggered by the recent death of his wife. Initially mistaken for early-stage dementia due to his preoccupation with the past, a specialist elderly mental health assessment confirmed PTSD. He responded well to reminiscence therapy and low-dose Sertraline. His cognitive scores remained stable, confirming the symptoms were psychiatric rather than neurodegenerative."

post_traumatic_stress_disorder_015:
  primary_diagnosis: "Moderate PTSD following Workplace Accident"
  presenting_complaint: "Inability to return to the construction site and fear of heights."
  summary_of_course: "A 44-year-old male fell from scaffolding, sustaining minor physical injuries but significant psychological trauma.

He successfully returned to work on light duties after four months."

post_traumatic_stress_disorder_016:
  primary_diagnosis: "Acute Stress Disorder progressing to PTSD"
  presenting_complaint: "Dissociation and intense distress six weeks after a physical mugging."
  summary_of_course: "A 30-year-old female was seen in A&E immediately after a mugging and followed up in primary care. Her symptoms of depersonalisation and anxiety persisted beyond the one-month threshold required for a PTSD diagnosis. Early intervention with TF-CBT was initiated to prevent chronicity. By the three-month follow-up, her PCL-5 score had dropped from 55 to 22, indicating a positive response."

post_traumatic_stress_disorder_017:
  primary_diagnosis: "PTSD with Comorbid Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)"
  presenting_complaint: "Severe irritability, memory lapses, and sensitivity to light and sound."
  summary_of_course: "A 28-year-old male survived an IED blast while working as a private security contractor. The clinical picture was complicated by a mild TBI, making it difficult to distinguish between post-concussive syndrome and PTSD. Neuropsychological testing and psychiatric evaluation confirmed overlapping pathologies. A multidisciplinary approach involving neurology and trauma psychiatry was required to manage his complex cognitive and emotional needs."

post_traumatic_stress_disorder_018:
  primary_diagnosis: "Mild-Moderate PTSD (Secondary Traumatisation)"
  presenting_complaint: "Distressing images of a family member's traumatic death in hospital."
  summary_of_course: "A 48-year-old female witnessed the sudden, traumatic cardiac arrest and unsuccessful resuscitation of her husband. She subsequently developed intrusive 'internal loops' of the resuscitation attempts and avoided the hospital where it occurred. She was diagnosed with PTSD and received brief, targeted bereavement-focused trauma therapy. Her symptoms improved as she was able to process the grief separately from the trauma of the event."

post_traumatic_stress_disorder_019:
  primary_diagnosis: "PTSD, Dissociative Subtype"
  presenting_complaint: "Episodes of 'blanking out' and feeling like the world is 'not real' (derealisation)."
  summary_of_course: "A 35-year-old female with a history of childhood physical abuse presented with severe dissociative symptoms alongside standard PTSD criteria. During therapy, she would frequently 'zone out' or report feeling detached from her body. Treatment required a heavy focus on grounding techniques and 'window of tolerance' work before any trauma processing could occur. She was eventually transitioned to a specialist personality disorder and complex trauma service."

post_traumatic_stress_disorder_020:
  primary_diagnosis: "Chronic PTSD with Comorbid Chronic Pain"
  presenting_complaint: "Flashbacks of a house fire triggered by the smell of smoke and persistent neuropathic pain."
  summary_of_course: "A 60-year-old female suffered 20% burns in a house fire three years ago. Her recovery was hindered by the bidirectional relationship between her chronic pain and PTSD symptoms; pain flares triggered flashbacks, and flashbacks increased pain perception. A combined approach using Amitriptyline for pain/sleep and EMDR for the trauma was implemented. She reported significant improvements in quality of life and a reduction in both pain intensity and trauma frequency."
