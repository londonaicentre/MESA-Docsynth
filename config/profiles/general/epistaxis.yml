epistaxis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Environmental desiccated mucosa epistaxis
  presenting_complaint: Minor spotting of blood on tissues every morning
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female presented during winter with complaints of dry, painful nasal passages and minor bleeding. Examination showed dry, cracked mucosa over the anterior septum with no active bleeding point. Symptoms resolved completely with the use of a humidifier and twice-daily application of white soft paraffin.

epistaxis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Epistaxis of pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent moderate nosebleeds during the third trimester
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant female (34 weeks gestation) reported increased frequency of epistaxis. This was attributed to gestational hyperaemia and increased mucosal vascularity. She was managed conservatively with topical lubricants and reassurance, with symptoms resolving spontaneously post-partum.

epistaxis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Traumatic epistaxis with nasal fracture
  presenting_complaint: Profuse bleeding and deformity following facial trauma
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male sustained a blow to the nose during a rugby match, resulting in immediate haemorrhage and a lateral deviation of the nasal bridge. The bleeding was controlled with anterior packing in A&E. He was scheduled for closed reduction of the nasal fracture under general anaesthesia five days later once swelling subsided.

epistaxis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Epistaxis secondary to Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic crusting, epistaxis, and "saddle nose" deformity
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old male presented with persistent nasal crusting, intermittent bleeding, and new-onset shortness of breath.

  primary_diagnosis: Topical steroid-induced septal ulceration
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent epistaxis and nasal stinging
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female using long-term fluticasone spray for allergic rhinitis presented with recurrent minor bleeds. Examination showed a 5mm ulcer on the anterior septum caused by poor spray technique. She was instructed on the "opposite hand to opposite nostril" technique and prescribed a short course of antiseptic ointment.

epistaxis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Epistaxis secondary to Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent nosebleeds and worsening asthma
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male on high-dose aspirin for chronic pain presented with frequent epistaxis and nasal polyposis. His bleeding was exacerbated by the antiplatelet effect of aspirin. He underwent endoscopic sinus surgery for polyp removal, and his aspirin was switched to an alternative analgesic, leading to a reduction in epistaxis frequency.

epistaxis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Von Willebrand Disease (vWD) presenting as epistaxis
  presenting_complaint: Prolonged nosebleeds since early childhood and heavy menses
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old girl presented with an epistaxis episode lasting over two hours. A detailed history revealed easy bruising and menorrhagia.
