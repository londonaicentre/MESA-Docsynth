  primary_diagnosis: Uncomplicated indirect inguinal hernia
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent right-sided groin swelling and dull ache
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male labourer presented with a reducible lump in the right groin that appears during heavy lifting. Physical examination confirmed a cough impulse and the lump was easily reduced manually. He underwent elective Lichtenstein tension-free mesh repair under general anaesthetic and was discharged the same day with no complications.

inguinal_or_femoral_hernia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Strangulated femoral hernia
  presenting_complaint: Severe, constant pain in the left groin with nausea and vomiting
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation presented acutely with a small, hard, exquisitely tender lump below and lateral to the pubic tubercle. CT imaging revealed a femoral hernia containing ischaemic small bowel. She underwent emergency surgery involving bowel resection and primary repair of the femoral canal, followed by a 5-day hospital stay for post-operative monitoring.

inguinal_or_femoral_hernia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric inguinal hernia
  presenting_complaint: Bulge in the scrotum noticed by parents during nappy changes
  summary_of_course: A 4-month-old male infant was referred by his GP after parents noticed a transient swelling in the right scrotum when he cried. Examination revealed a patent processus vaginalis and a reducible indirect inguinal hernia. He underwent an elective herniotomy as a day case, with an unremarkable recovery and no recurrence at the 6-week follow-up.

inguinal_or_femoral_hernia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Incarcerated inguinal hernia
  presenting_complaint: Irreducible left groin lump and abdominal bloating
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with COPD presented with a long-standing hernia that had become irreducible over the last 12 hours. While he remained haemodynamically stable and without signs of peritonitis, bedside attempts at reduction failed. He was taken for urgent surgical exploration which found viable omentum within the sac, treated with mesh repair and smoking cessation advice.

inguinal_or_femoral_hernia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Direct inguinal hernia
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral groin discomfort and visible bulges
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with chronic prostatic hypertrophy presented with bilateral swellings medial to the inferior epigastric vessels. The bulges were more prominent when standing and disappeared when supine, characteristic of direct hernias. Management involved watchful waiting and optimization of his urinary symptoms before considering laparoscopic TEP (Totally Extraperitoneal) repair.

inguinal_or_femoral_hernia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: De Garengeot hernia
  presenting_complaint: Tender right groin lump and low-grade fever
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female presented with what appeared to be an incarcerated femoral hernia. Intra-operative findings revealed the vermiform appendix within the femoral hernia sac showing signs of acute inflammation. An appendicectomy was performed through the hernia sac followed by a Cooper’s ligament repair, with a successful recovery.

inguinal_or_femoral_hernia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent inguinal hernia
  presenting_complaint: Recurrence of a lump at the site of a previous surgical repair
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male who had an open mesh repair five years ago presented with a new swelling in the same region. Ultrasound confirmed a recurrent indirect hernia at the internal ring. He was managed via a laparoscopic TAPP (Transabdominal Preperitoneal) approach to avoid the scarred tissue from the previous open surgery.

inguinal_or_femoral_hernia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Pantaloon hernia
  presenting_complaint: Large, persistent right-sided groin bulge
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male was found to have both direct and indirect hernia components on the same side during surgical exploration. The "pantaloon" defect straddled the inferior epigastric vessels. Both sacs were reduced and a large prolene mesh was used to reinforce the entire myopectineal orifice.

inguinal_or_femoral_hernia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Sliding inguinal hernia
  presenting_complaint: Groin lump associated with urinary frequency
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male presented with a large left-sided inguinoscrotal hernia. During surgery, the wall of the urinary bladder was found to form part of the hernia sac wall (a sliding hernia). Careful dissection was required to avoid cystotomy, and the bladder was returned to the extraperitoneal space before mesh reinforcement.

inguinal_or_femoral_hernia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Richter's hernia (femoral)
  presenting_complaint: Localised groin pain but no signs of bowel obstruction
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old female presented with a painful, firm lump in the right femoral canal but continued to pass flatus and stool. Surgical exploration revealed a Richter’s hernia where only part of the bowel wall circumference was entrapped and gangrenous. Localised resection of the necrotic segment and femoral canal repair were performed.

inguinal_or_femoral_hernia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Amyand's hernia
  presenting_complaint: Painful right scrotal swelling and redness
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented with clinical signs of an incarcerated inguinal hernia. Surgery revealed a non-inflamed appendix within the inguinal hernia sac. The appendix was reduced into the abdominal cavity and a standard Lichtenstein mesh repair was completed without appendicectomy.

inguinal_or_femoral_hernia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic inguinoscrotal hernia
  presenting_complaint: Massive scrotal swelling reaching mid-thigh level
  summary_of_course: An 84-year-old male presented with a "loss of domain" hernia that he had neglected for twenty years. Due to multiple comorbidities including heart failure and the risk of abdominal compartment syndrome upon reduction, he was managed conservatively with a scrotal support garment and optimization of fluid status.

inguinal_or_femoral_hernia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Obstructed femoral hernia
  presenting_complaint: Colicky abdominal pain, absolute constipation, and groin lump
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female presented to the ED with classical mechanical bowel obstruction. Examination revealed a non-reducible, non-tender lump in the left groin, often missed on initial assessment. CT confirmed a femoral hernia causing proximal dilatation; she underwent emergency Lockwood’s infra-inguinal repair.

inguinal_or_femoral_hernia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Inguinal hernia with mesh infection
  presenting_complaint: Chronic discharging sinus in the groin following hernia repair
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented six months after an open hernia repair with persistent purulent drainage from the surgical scar. Conservative management with antibiotics failed, and imaging showed a deep fluid collection around the mesh. He required total mesh excision and delayed primary closure, with the hernia eventually managed via a non-mesh Shouldice technique.

inguinal_or_femoral_hernia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Inguinal hernia in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: New groin lump at 24 weeks gestation
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old primigravida noticed a reducible swelling in her right labia majora and groin. Clinical examination suggested an indirect inguinal hernia, likely exacerbated by increased intra-abdominal pressure and ligamentous laxity. She was managed conservatively with a support belt and scheduled for post-partum surgical review, as the hernia was easily reducible.

inguinal_or_femoral_hernia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic post-surgical inguinal neuralgia
  presenting_complaint: Burning pain in the groin and inner thigh post-hernia repair
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male reported debilitating neuropathic pain following an uneventful mesh repair one year prior. Examination showed hyperaesthesia in the distribution of the ilioinguinal nerve. After failing conservative measures like nerve blocks and gabapentin, he underwent surgical neurectomy and mesh exploration to alleviate the nerve entrapment.

inguinal_or_femoral_hernia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Inguinal hernia presenting as hydrocele
  presenting_complaint: Gradual enlargement of the right scrotum
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male was initially diagnosed with a simple hydrocele due to positive transillumination. However, the swelling changed in size throughout the day, and subsequent ultrasound revealed a small indirect hernia sac associated with a vaginal hydrocele. He underwent a combined inguinal herniotomy and Jaboulay's procedure for the hydrocele.

inguinal_or_femoral_hernia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Femoral hernia mimicking lymphadenopathy
  presenting_complaint: Small, painless lump in the right groin
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female was referred for suspected Cloquet’s lymph node enlargement. The lump was non-reducible and lacked a cough impulse, but ultrasound demonstrated a femoral hernia sac containing omentum. Given the high risk of strangulation in females, she was fast-tracked for elective repair.

inguinal_or_femoral_hernia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Incarcerated inguinal hernia in a patient with ascites
  presenting_complaint: Tense, painful groin swelling in a patient with liver cirrhosis
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis and gross ascites presented with an acutely tender inguinal hernia. The increased intra-abdominal pressure had forced ascitic fluid and omentum into the sac, causing incarceration. He required urgent paracentesis to reduce pressure followed by a cautious surgical repair with meticulous haemostasis due to coagulopathy.

inguinal_or_femoral_hernia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Strangulated inguinal hernia with systemic sepsis
  presenting_complaint: Altered mental status, hypotension, and gangrenous skin over the groin
  summary_of_course: A 90-year-old male from a nursing home was admitted in septic shock. Examination revealed a black, necrotic-appearing skin patch over a large right inguinal mass. Emergency surgery confirmed a gangrenous loop of ileum within the sac with associated abscess formation; he was transferred to ICU post-operatively for vasopressor support but unfortunately succumbed to multi-organ failure.
