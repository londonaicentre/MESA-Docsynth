polymyalgia_rheumatica_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Classical Polymyalgia Rheumatica
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral shoulder and hip girdle pain with profound morning stiffness.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female presented to her GP with a 4-week history of symmetrical proximal limb girdle pain and stiffness lasting 2 hours each morning. Bloods revealed an ESR of 65 mm/hr and CRP of 48 mg/L, with negative RF and anti-CCP. She commenced 15mg Prednisolone daily with a dramatic resolution of symptoms within 48 hours, confirming the diagnosis.

polymyalgia_rheumatica_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Polymyalgia Rheumatica with Giant Cell Arteritis overlap
  presenting_complaint: Shoulder stiffness associated with new-onset temporal headache and jaw claudication.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with known PMR symptoms for two months developed acute right-sided headache and pain when chewing. Urgent temporal artery biopsy confirmed GCA; he was treated with high-dose IV methylprednisolone followed by a slow oral taper. His PMR symptoms resolved concurrently with the GCA treatment, though he remains on long-term steroid-sparing agents.

polymyalgia_rheumatica_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Atypical Polymyalgia Rheumatica (Normal Inflammatory Markers)
  presenting_complaint: Severe pelvic girdle pain and difficulty rising from a chair.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female presented with classic proximal stiffness but persistently normal ESR (12 mm/hr) and CRP (4 mg/L). Despite the normal markers, clinical suspicion remained high, and a trial of 15mg Prednisolone resulted in complete symptom relief. This case highlights that 10-20% of PMR patients may present with normal inflammatory markers.

polymyalgia_rheumatica_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Steroid-Refractory Polymyalgia Rheumatica
  presenting_complaint: Persistent shoulder pain despite three weeks of 15mg Prednisolone.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female failed to improve on standard-dose steroids, raising concerns for alternative diagnoses. After excluding occult malignancy and myeloma via CT CAP and electrophoresis, her Prednisolone was increased to 20mg and Methotrexate was added as a steroid-sparing agent. She eventually achieved remission after four months of dual therapy.

polymyalgia_rheumatica_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Relapsing Polymyalgia Rheumatica
  presenting_complaint: Return of hip stiffness during Prednisolone taper.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male, successfully treated for PMR for six months, experienced a flare of symptoms when his Prednisolone dose was reduced from 7.5mg to 5mg. His CRP rose from 3 mg/L to 25 mg/L. The dose was increased back to 10mg for one month before attempting a more gradual "Adler" tapering regimen.

polymyalgia_rheumatica_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Polymyalgia Rheumatica with RS3PE Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Proximal stiffness accompanied by marked swelling of the dorsum of both hands.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male presented with bilateral shoulder pain and "pitting" oedema of the hands (Remitting Seronegative Symmetrical Synovitis with Pitting Oedema). Investigations showed high inflammatory markers and negative serology. He responded excellently to low-dose Prednisolone, which resolved both the proximal stiffness and the peripheral oedema within one week.

polymyalgia_rheumatica_007:
  primary_diagnosis: PMR-like presentation of Late-Onset Rheumatoid Arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Symmetrical shoulder pain and stiffness followed by small joint swelling.
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old female initially diagnosed with PMR based on proximal symptoms and high CRP. However, after three months, she developed swelling in the MCP and PIP joints of both hands. Anti-CCP antibodies were strongly positive, leading to a revised diagnosis of LORA, and she was transitioned from Prednisolone to Sulfasalazine and Methotrexate.

polymyalgia_rheumatica_008:
  primary_diagnosis: PMR with Steroid-Induced Hyperglycaemia
  presenting_complaint: Acute proximal stiffness in a patient with Type 2 Diabetes.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with well-controlled T2DM started 15mg Prednisolone for PMR. Within days, his capillary blood glucose levels rose to 22 mmol/L, requiring an urgent review of his diabetes medications. His PMR symptoms were well-controlled, but he required the introduction of Gliclazide to manage the steroid-induced hyperglycaemia during the initial high-dose phase.

polymyalgia_rheumatica_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute Polymyalgia Rheumatica in a Frail Elderly Patient
  presenting_complaint: Sudden loss of mobility and inability to perform activities of daily living.
  summary_of_course: A 92-year-old female in a residential care home became bedbound due to severe pain in her shoulders and thighs. Initially triaged as a "failure to thrive," her CRP was found to be 110 mg/L. A diagnosis of PMR was made, and after starting Prednisolone, she regained her baseline mobility within five days, avoiding permanent institutionalisation.

polymyalgia_rheumatica_010:
  primary_diagnosis: PMR Masquerading as Paraneoplastic Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss, night sweats, and proximal muscle stiffness.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male presented with PMR-like symptoms but also significant systemic features and a 10kg weight loss. Initial Prednisolone 15mg provided only partial relief. Subsequent CT imaging revealed a renal cell carcinoma; his "PMR" was determined to be a paraneoplastic manifestation, which resolved only after nephrectomy.

polymyalgia_rheumatica_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Polymyalgia Rheumatica with Steroid-Induced Osteoporosis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset back pain in a patient on long-term steroids for PMR.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old female had been on Prednisolone for PMR for over two years due to multiple relapses. She presented with acute mid-thoracic pain; an X-ray confirmed a wedge fracture at T8. Despite being on Alendronic acid, her bone mineral density had significantly declined, necessitating a switch to Denosumab and a more aggressive steroid-tapering strategy using Leflunomide.

polymyalgia_rheumatica_012:
  primary_diagnosis: PMR with Co-existing Fibromyalgia
  presenting_complaint: Widespread pain and fatigue that only partially responds to steroids.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old female with a history of fibromyalgia developed new, distinct bilateral shoulder stiffness and elevated ESR (50 mm/hr). While Prednisolone 15mg improved the morning stiffness and lowered her ESR, her baseline widespread musculoskeletal pain persisted. Management required distinguishing between the inflammatory PMR component and the non-inflammatory fibromyalgia.

polymyalgia_rheumatica_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Polymyalgia Rheumatica post-influenza vaccination
  presenting_complaint: Rapid onset of shoulder and pelvic girdle pain 48 hours after immunisation.
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male developed severe stiffness shortly after his annual flu jab. CRP was 76 mg/L. While rare, a temporal link between vaccination and PMR onset has been documented; he responded typically to 15mg Prednisolone and followed a standard 18-month tapering course without further complications.

polymyalgia_rheumatica_014:
  primary_diagnosis: PMR in a patient with Chronic Kidney Disease (Stage 4)
  presenting_complaint: Severe proximal stiffness and limited mobility.
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old male with an eGFR of 22 ml/min presented with classic PMR. Management was complicated by his renal impairment, limiting the use of NSAIDs for breakthrough pain. He was started on a cautious dose of Prednisolone 12.5mg, with close monitoring of fluid balance and blood pressure, achieving good symptomatic control.

polymyalgia_rheumatica_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Polymyalgia Rheumatica
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent shoulder aching and morning stiffness of 45 minutes.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female presented with mild but persistent symptoms and a CRP of 18 mg/L. Given the mildness of the presentation, she was started on a lower initial dose of 10mg Prednisolone. This was sufficient to achieve complete remission, and she was able to taper off steroids completely within 12 months.

polymyalgia_rheumatica_016:
  primary_diagnosis: PMR presenting as Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent low-grade fevers, night sweats, and lethargy.
  summary_of_course: A 76-year-old female underwent extensive investigations for FUO, including negative blood cultures and a normal PET-CT. On further questioning, she admitted to significant hip stiffness. Her ESR was 90 mm/hr. A trial of steroids resolved the fevers within 24 hours and the stiffness shortly after, confirming PMR as the underlying cause of her systemic symptoms.

polymyalgia_rheumatica_017:
  primary_diagnosis: PMR with Statin-Induced Myopathy Mimicry
  presenting_complaint: Muscle pain and weakness in the upper arms and thighs.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male on Atorvastatin 40mg presented with proximal pain. Creatine kinase (CK) was normal, but CRP was 40 mg/L. Statin was briefly paused with no improvement, but the introduction of Prednisolone 15mg led to immediate relief, confirming PMR rather than statin-induced myotoxicity.

polymyalgia_rheumatica_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe PMR with Depression and Cognitive Impairment
  presenting_complaint: Withdrawal from social activities and inability to dress independently.
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old male was brought in by family for suspected dementia and low mood. Clinical examination revealed significant pain-limited range of motion in the shoulders. High inflammatory markers and a rapid response to Prednisolone revealed that his "cognitive decline" and "depression" were secondary to the chronic pain and physical limitations of undiagnosed PMR.

polymyalgia_rheumatica_019:
  primary_diagnosis: PMR requiring Biologic Therapy (Tocilizumab)
  presenting_complaint: Multiple relapses of proximal stiffness despite Methotrexate.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old female with refractory PMR experienced severe steroid side effects, including cushingoid features and gastric ulceration. After failing Methotrexate as a steroid-sparing agent, she was started on Tocilizumab (anti-IL6) according to specialist guidelines. This allowed for a successful and rapid steroid taper while maintaining clinical remission.

polymyalgia_rheumatica_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute PMR with Bilateral Subacromial Bursitis
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral shoulder pain and inability to abduct arms.
  summary_of_course: A 71-year-old female presented with severe shoulder pain. Ultrasound imaging confirmed bilateral subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis and long head of biceps tenosynovitis, which are characteristic sonographic findings in PMR. Her systemic inflammatory markers were elevated, and she responded well to the standard oral Prednisolone regimen.
