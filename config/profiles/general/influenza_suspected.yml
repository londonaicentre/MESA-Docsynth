  primary_diagnosis: Delirium secondary to suspected influenza
  presenting_complaint: Acute confusion and reduced mobility
  summary_of_course: An 89-year-old resident of a nursing home was brought to A&E after becoming acutely disoriented and "off her legs." She had no respiratory symptoms but was febrile at 38.4C and tachycardic. A respiratory viral screen was positive for Influenza A, and her delirium resolved as her temperature was controlled.

influenza_suspected_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute severe asthma triggered by influenza
  presenting_complaint: Severe wheezing and inability to complete sentences
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old boy with known asthma presented with a 24-hour history of cough and fever followed by acute respiratory distress. Despite multiple doses of his salbutamol inhaler, his peak flow was only 40% of predicted. He was admitted for back-to-back nebulisers and IV magnesium sulphate, with influenza confirmed as the precipitating factor.

influenza_suspected_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Influenza-associated ARDS
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly worsening hypoxia and dry cough
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male with no significant PMH presented with a one-week history of worsening flu symptoms. Within 12 hours of admission, he developed severe hypoxaemia (PaO2/FiO2 ratio <150) and bilateral "white-out" on CXR. He required intubation, prone positioning, and was referred to a regional centre for potential ECMO support.

influenza_suspected_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Suspected influenza bronchiolitis
  presenting_complaint: Poor feeding, grunting, and intercostal recession
  summary_of_course: A 7-month-old infant presented with a two-day history of coryza and a worsening cough that interfered with feeding. Clinical exam showed widespread fine inspiratory crackles and expiratory wheeze with oxygen saturations of 91%. He was admitted for nasogastric feeding support and humidified oxygen via nasal cannulae.

influenza_suspected_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Suspected influenza in a healthcare worker
  presenting_complaint: Sore throat, mild myalgia, and low-grade pyrexia
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old nurse presented to occupational health after developing symptoms 48 hours after treating a patient with confirmed Influenza A. Due to her high-risk exposure and direct patient contact, she was swabbed and started on prophylactic oseltamivir. She remained off work for five days until her symptoms resolved and PCR results were reviewed.

He was afebrile but had a new-onset cough and crackles to the mid-zones bilaterally. BNP was significantly elevated, and viral PCR confirmed influenza, which had precipitated the acute fluid overload.

  primary_diagnosis: Influenza-associated myositis
  presenting_complaint: Severe calf pain and inability to walk
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old boy presented three days after the onset of flu-like symptoms with intense pain in both calves. His parents noted his urine appeared very dark, "like cola." Laboratory tests revealed a CK of 15,000 U/L, and he was admitted for aggressive IV hydration to prevent acute kidney injury from rhabdomyolysis.

influenza_suspected_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Suspected influenza encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Altered consciousness and visual hallucinations
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old girl was admitted with a high fever and unusual behaviour, including failing to recognise her parents. Lumbar puncture showed no growth and normal biochemistry, but EEG showed generalised slowing. Influenza A was detected on a nasopharyngeal swab, and she was treated with high-dose oseltamivir and supportive neuro-intensive care.

influenza_suspected_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-viral fatigue following suspected influenza
  presenting_complaint: Persistent exhaustion and brain fog
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female returned to her GP three weeks after an acute bout of suspected influenza. Although her fever and cough had resolved, she remained unable to return to work due to profound lethargy and difficulty concentrating. Blood tests for anaemia and thyroid function were normal, and she was managed with a phased return to activity.

  primary_diagnosis: Severe influenza in morbid obesity
  presenting_complaint: Hypoxia and productive cough
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male with a BMI of 46 presented with a five-day history of severe flu symptoms. He was found to be significantly hypoxic (SpO2 84%) and required immediate CPAP therapy. His recovery was prolonged, requiring a 10-day hospital stay and extended antiviral treatment due to his high risk of complications.

influenza_suspected_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Suspected oseltamivir-resistant influenza
  presenting_complaint: Persistent high fevers despite antiviral therapy
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old haematology patient undergoing chemotherapy was started on oseltamivir for confirmed Influenza A. After six days of treatment, his fevers and respiratory symptoms showed no improvement. Samples were sent for H275Y mutation analysis, and his treatment was switched to intravenous zanamivir.

influenza_suspected_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Viral co-infection (Influenza and SARS-CoV-2)
  presenting_complaint: Anosmia, high fever, and severe breathlessness
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male presented during the winter period with a complex respiratory picture. Dual viral PCR testing was positive for both Influenza A and SARS-CoV-2. He required dexamethasone for COVID-19 and oseltamivir for influenza, demonstrating the clinical challenge of managing multiple concurrent respiratory pathogens.
