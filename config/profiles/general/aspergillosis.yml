  presenting_complaint: Chronic productive cough, weight loss, and occasional haemoptysis over six months.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with a history of treated pulmonary tuberculosis ten years ago presented with constitutional symptoms. Imaging showed a stable cavity in the left apex containing a mobile fungal ball (aspergilloma) and pleural thickening. Positive Aspergillus precipitins confirmed CPA, and he was started on long-term oral itraconazole therapy with regular monitoring of liver function.

aspergillosis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Simple Aspergilloma
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic incidental finding on routine chest radiograph.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female undergoing preoperative screening for elective cholecystectomy was found to have a well-defined opacity within a pre-existing emphysematous bulla. A follow-up CT confirmed a classic 'Monod sign' suggestive of a simple aspergilloma. As she remained entirely asymptomatic with no haemoptysis, a strategy of watchful waiting with six-monthly imaging was adopted.

aspergillosis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Disseminated Aspergillosis
  presenting_complaint: New-onset seizures and necrotic skin lesions in a transplant recipient.
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old female, three months post-haematopoietic stem cell transplant for thalassaemia, presented with acute neurological decline. MRI brain showed multiple ring-enhancing lesions, and skin biopsy of an erythematous macule confirmed septate hyphae invading blood vessels. Despite aggressive treatment with liposomal amphotericin B and neurosurgery, the patient succumbed to multi-organ failure.

aspergillosis_006:

Sputum cultures were repeatedly positive for Aspergillus, and he was treated for CNPA with a prolonged course of oral voriconazole.

aspergillosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Aspergillus Tracheobronchitis
  presenting_complaint: Unexplained dyspnoea and inspiratory wheeze post-lung transplant.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male, six months post-bilateral lung transplant, presented with worsening exercise tolerance. Bronchoscopy revealed extensive pseudomembranous plaques covering the bronchial mucosa, which grew Aspergillus flavus on culture. Treatment involved a combination of systemic voriconazole and nebulised amphotericin B, alongside a reduction in immunosuppression.

aspergillosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary Cutaneous Aspergillosis
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly enlarging necrotic ulcer at the site of an intravenous cannula.
  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old male child in a paediatric burns unit developed a painful, black, necrotic lesion around a peripheral venous access site. Histopathology of the wound edge showed fungal hyphae invading the dermis, and cultures grew Aspergillus terreus. He was treated with systemic voriconazole and surgical excision of the infected tissue, with successful wound healing.

aspergillosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Aspergillus Endocarditis
  presenting_complaint: Fever, malaise, and a new cardiac murmur in a prosthetic valve patient.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female with a previous mitral valve replacement presented with signs of systemic embolisation and persistent pyrexia. Multiple blood cultures were negative, but transoesophageal echocardiography revealed large, friable vegetations. Following urgent valve replacement, histopathology of the explanted valve confirmed Aspergillus endocarditis, requiring life-long antifungal suppression.

aspergillosis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Extrinsic Allergic Alveolitis (Malt Worker's Lung)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of breathlessness, shivering, and dry cough.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male working in a malting granary reported symptoms that worsened during the working week and improved on weekends. High-resolution CT showed diffuse centrilobular ground-glass nodules, and serum precipitating antibodies to Aspergillus clavatus were detected. He was diagnosed with occupational hypersensitivity pneumonitis and recovered fully after changing his work environment and a short course of corticosteroids.

  primary_diagnosis: Aspergillus Keratitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe eye pain, redness, and blurred vision following minor trauma.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female gardener presented with a corneal ulcer after being struck in the eye by a tree branch. Slit-lamp examination showed a feathery infiltrate and satellite lesions characteristic of fungal infection. Corneal scrapings confirmed Aspergillus fumigatus, and she was treated with intensive topical natamycin 5% drops and systemic antifungals to prevent globe perforation.

aspergillosis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Asthma with Fungal Sensitisation (SAFS)
  presenting_complaint: Brittle asthma with frequent hospital admissions despite maximal inhaler therapy.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with refractory asthma did not meet the full criteria for ABPA (normal total IgE) but showed strong skin prick reactivity to Aspergillus antigens. He was diagnosed with SAFS and commenced on a trial of oral itraconazole for six months. This resulted in a significant reduction in exacerbation frequency and improved peak flow measurements.

aspergillosis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Renal Aspergillosis
  presenting_complaint: Unilateral flank pain and visible 'tissue-like' material in the urine.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female, two years post-renal transplant, presented with symptoms mimicking nephrolithiasis. Imaging revealed filling defects in the renal pelvis, and ureteroscopy identified fungal balls obstructing the ureter. Cultures from the debris grew Aspergillus, and she was managed with percutaneous antifungal irrigation and systemic voriconazole.

aspergillosis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Aspergillus Osteomyelitis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic back pain and localised tenderness over the thoracic spine.
  summary_of_pkourse: A 20-year-old male with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) presented with progressive spinal pain and an elevated ESR. MRI showed T8-T9 discitis and osteomyelitis with a paraspinal abscess. Fine-needle aspiration confirmed Aspergillus nidulans, an organism frequently seen in CGD patients, necessitating long-term antifungal therapy and surgical stabilisation.

aspergillosis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: COVID-19 Associated Pulmonary Aspergillosis (CAPA)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden respiratory deterioration in a ventilated ICU patient.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with severe COVID-19 pneumonitis on dexamethasone therapy showed clinical worsening on day 10 of mechanical ventilation. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed, showing a galactomannan index of 4.5 and positive Aspergillus PCR. He was diagnosed with CAPA and started on isavuconazole, but despite intensive support, he developed a pneumothorax and died.

aspergillosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Gastrointestinal Aspergillosis
  presenting_complaint: Acute abdominal pain and haematochezia during chemotherapy.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female undergoing intensive chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia developed sudden-onset peritonitis. Emergency laparotomy revealed a perforated ileal ulcer, and histopathology of the resected segment showed angioinvasive hyphae consistent with Aspergillus. This rare presentation required aggressive antifungal therapy and a prolonged pause in her haematological treatment.

aspergillosis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Cerebral Aspergilloma
  presenting_complaint: Progressive headache and focal neurological deficits in an HIV-positive patient.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with HIV and a CD4 count of 45 cells/uL presented with right-sided weakness. Brain imaging identified a large, solid, ring-enhancing mass in the left parietal lobe, initially suspected to be toxoplasmosis or lymphoma. Stereotactic biopsy revealed a dense mass of Aspergillus hyphae, and he was treated with voriconazole and optimization of his antiretroviral therapy.

aspergillosis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Multi-azole Resistant Invasive Aspergillosis
  presenting_complaint: Failure to improve on standard antifungal therapy for IPA.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with neutropenic sepsis and pulmonary infiltrates was initially started on voriconazole. Despite therapeutic drug levels, her inflammatory markers rose and repeat CT showed lesion progression. Environmental screening and susceptibility testing of a BAL isolate confirmed a TR34/L98H mutation conferring azole resistance, necessitating a switch to liposomal amphotericin B.
