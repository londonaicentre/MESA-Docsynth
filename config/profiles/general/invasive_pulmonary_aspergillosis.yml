invasive_pulmonary_aspergillosis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: COVID-19 Associated Pulmonary Aspergillosis (CAPA)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden respiratory deterioration in the ICU
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male hospitalised with severe COVID-19 pneumonia required mechanical ventilation and dexamethasone. On day 12, his oxygenation requirements increased sharply alongside new fever and rising inflammatory markers. BAL galactomannan was highly elevated (index 4.8), confirming CAPA, but despite treatment with Liposomal Amphotericin B, the patient succumbed to multi-organ failure.

invasive_pulmonary_aspergillosis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Necrotising Pulmonary Aspergillosis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic cough and intermittent haemoptysis
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with a history of treated pulmonary tuberculosis presented with a six-month history of lethargy and coughing up small amounts of blood. CT imaging demonstrated a stable cavity in the left apex with new-onset tissue invasion and pleural thickening. Positive Aspergillus precipitin tests and elevated Aspergillus-specific IgG confirmed the diagnosis, requiring long-term antifungal therapy.

invasive_pulmonary_aspergillosis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis with CNS Dissemination
  presenting_complaint: Fever, headache, and focal neurological deficits
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female following an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant for ALL developed sudden-onset right-sided weakness. Chest CT showed typical invasive fungal nodules, while brain MRI confirmed multiple ring-enhancing lesions. Serum galactomannan was positive, and despite aggressive dual therapy with Voriconazole and Caspofungin, the clinical course was rapidly fatal.

invasive_pulmonary_aspergillosis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Influenza-Associated Pulmonary Aspergillosis (IAPA)
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive respiratory failure following viral prodrome
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old previously healthy female was admitted with severe Influenza A. Within 48 hours of ICU admission, she developed necrotising tracheobronchitis seen on bronchoscopy, with biopsies showing septate hyphae. Diagnosis of IAPA was made, and she required Veno-venous ECMO and prolonged antifungal therapy for recovery.

invasive_pulmonary_aspergillosis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis in Liver Cirrhosis
  presenting_complaint: Fever and jaundice in a non-neutropenic patient
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with Child-Pugh C alcoholic cirrhosis was admitted with decompensated liver failure and suspected sepsis. Despite no classic immunosuppression, CT chest showed dense consolidation and BAL galactomannan was positive. The patient’s condition was complicated by hepatorenal syndrome, making antifungal dosing challenging before he was transitioned to palliative care.

invasive_pulmonary_aspergillosis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis
  presenting_complaint: Fever and dry cough in a child with leukaemia
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy undergoing chemotherapy for relapsed AML developed a persistent fever during a period of profound neutropenia. High-resolution CT showed a solitary nodule with an air-crescent sign in the left lower lobe. He was treated with Liposomal Amphotericin B followed by oral Voriconazole, with complete radiological resolution after three months.

invasive_pulmonary_aspergillosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis with Massive Haemoptysis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, large-volume coughing of blood
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with known invasive aspergillosis involving the pulmonary artery branches suffered a catastrophic haemoptysis event (approx. 500ml). Emergent bronchial artery embolisation was performed by interventional radiology to stabilise the patient. He remained in ICU for two weeks on antifungal therapy and was eventually discharged on Isavuconazole.

invasive_pulmonary_aspergillosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis in a Renal Transplant Recipient
  presenting_complaint: Subacute dyspnoea and pleuritic pain
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male, six months post-renal transplant and on triple immunosuppression, presented with a dry cough. CT imaging revealed peripheral wedge-shaped infarcts, and Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated from a CT-guided fine-needle aspirate. Immunosuppression was cautiously reduced, and he completed a successful course of Voriconazole without graft rejection.

invasive_pulmonary_aspergillosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Azole-Resistant Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis
  presenting_complaint: Non-resolving pneumonia despite antifungal treatment
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old gardener with underlying bronchiectasis was treated for IPA with Voriconazole, but repeat CT showed lesion progression. Environmental resistance was suspected, and susceptibility testing of the BAL isolate confirmed a TR34/L98H mutation in the CYP51A gene. Treatment was switched to Liposomal Amphotericin B, which led to subsequent clinical improvement.

invasive_pulmonary_aspergillosis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis complicating Sarcoidosis
  presenting_complaint: Worsening shortness of breath and new infiltrates
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female with stage IV pulmonary sarcoidosis on high-dose steroids and Infliximab presented with acute respiratory decline. Initial suspicion was a sarcoid flare, but BAL galactomannan was 3.2, and fungal PCR was positive for Aspergillus. She required a prolonged ICU stay and careful management of her underlying sarcoidosis while receiving antifungal therapy.

invasive_pulmonary_aspergillosis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis (Early Detection)
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic patient with high-risk neutropenia
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male undergoing induction for AML was monitored with twice-weekly serum galactomannan screening. An asymptomatic rise in galactomannan index to 0.8 prompted a CT chest, which showed a tiny 5mm halo-sign nodule. Early pre-emptive treatment with Voriconazole prevented clinical progression and allowed for the continuation of chemotherapy.

invasive_pulmonary_aspergillosis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis with Bronchopleural Fistula
  presenting_complaint: Severe chest pain and persistent pneumothorax
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with necrotising IPA developed a spontaneous pneumothorax that failed to resolve with a chest drain. Thoracoscopy revealed a bronchopleural fistula caused by fungal erosion of the lung parenchyma into the pleural space. He required surgical debridement and a prolonged course of intravenous antifungals.

invasive_pulmonary_aspergillosis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis in HIV/AIDS
  presenting_complaint: Fever, weight loss, and dyspnoea
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male with newly diagnosed HIV and a CD4 count of 12 cells/uL presented with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Initial investigations for PCP were negative, but BAL was positive for Aspergillus hyphae. He was started on Voriconazole and antiretroviral therapy, though he experienced significant drug-drug interactions requiring intensive pharmacological monitoring.

invasive_pulmonary_aspergillosis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis (Diagnostic Challenge)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent cough and low-grade fever
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female with rheumatoid arthritis on Methotrexate presented with non-specific respiratory symptoms. Multiple serum galactomannan tests were negative, and sputum cultures were inconclusive. Diagnosis was eventually confirmed via a VATS lung biopsy which showed invasive septate hyphae, highlighting the limitations of non-invasive markers in non-neutropenic hosts.

invasive_pulmonary_aspergillosis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis in Heart Transplant
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of fever and cough
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male, three weeks post-orthotopic heart transplant, developed acute respiratory distress. CT chest showed rapidly progressive consolidation in the right middle lobe. BAL confirmed Aspergillus fumigatus, and he was treated with Isavuconazole to avoid the significant Tacrolimus interactions associated with Voriconazole.

invasive_pulmonary_aspergillosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis with Chest Wall Invasion
  presenting_complaint: Localised pleuritic pain and a palpable chest wall mass
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) presented with a painful swelling on his right thorax. Imaging showed a large peripheral pulmonary fungal ball invading through the intercostal space into the soft tissue. Due to his age and comorbidities, he was managed with long-term suppressive oral antifungal therapy rather than radical surgery.

invasive_pulmonary_aspergillosis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of chronic respiratory symptoms
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old female with a known aspergilloma and underlying bronchiectasis developed acute fever and new cavitary lesions on CT. Serum galactomannan was positive, suggesting the transition from chronic to invasive disease following a course of high-dose steroids for an asthma exacerbation. She was hospitalised for intravenous Voriconazole.

invasive_pulmonary_aspergillosis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis with Multi-organ Failure
  presenting_complaint: Septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with severe aplastic anaemia was admitted to the ICU with profound shock and hypoxia. Chest X-ray showed "white-out" lungs, and Aspergillus was identified in tracheal aspirates within 24 hours. Despite maximal supportive care including vasopressors and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, the patient died shortly after the diagnosis of disseminated IPA.
