unstable_angina_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Unstable Angina
  presenting_complaint: Crescendo chest pain and exertional dyspnoea
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male smoker with known hypertension presented with retrosternal chest pressure occurring at decreasing levels of exertion over the past week. ECG demonstrated horizontal ST depression in leads V4-V6 during episodes, which resolved with sublingual GTN. Serial high-sensitivity Troponin T levels remained below the 99th percentile myocardial infarction threshold. He was commenced on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and fondaparinux, with subsequent coronary angiography revealing a 90% stenosis in the mid-LAD.

unstable_angina_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Atypical Unstable Angina
  presenting_complaint: Epigastric discomfort and nausea
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with Type 2 diabetes presented to A&E with a 4-hour history of vague epigastric burning and nausea, initially mistaken for dyspepsia. Clinical suspicion remained high due to her cardiovascular risk profile; an ECG showed new deep T-wave inversions in the inferior leads. Serial troponins were negative, but the persistence of symptoms at rest led to a diagnosis of unstable angina. She was stabilised with medical management and scheduled for urgent inpatient coronary intervention.

unstable_angina_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-PCI Unstable Angina
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent rest pain following recent stenting
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male, who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the Right Coronary Artery (RCA) three weeks prior, presented with recurrent episodes of heavy chest pain at rest. ECG showed no new ST-segment changes, and biomarkers for myocardial necrosis were negative. Urgent angiography was performed due to the high risk of subacute stent thrombosis, which confirmed 85% in-stent restenosis. He was treated with balloon angioplasty and an adjustment to his antiplatelet regimen.

unstable_angina_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary Unstable Angina
  presenting_complaint: Chest pain precipitated by acute anaemia
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with a history of stable angina presented with melaena and new-onset chest pain at rest. Investigations revealed a haemoglobin of 72 g/L due to a bleeding peptic ulcer, causing a supply-demand mismatch. ECG showed transient ST depression during the pain, which resolved following a blood transfusion and proton pump inhibitor therapy. The unstable angina was classified as secondary to acute anaemia, and she was managed conservatively once her haemoglobin stabilised.

unstable_angina_005:
  primary_diagnosis: High-risk Unstable Angina (Wellens' Syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent severe retrosternal heaviness
  summary_of_course: A 46-year-old male presented to the GP with intermittent episodes of severe chest heaviness that had started two days ago. Although he was pain-free during the consultation, his ECG showed characteristic biphasic T-waves in leads V2 and V3. He was admitted urgently to the CCU for suspected Wellens' syndrome; serial troponins were negative, but angiography confirmed a critical 95% proximal LAD stenosis. He underwent successful drug-eluting stent (DES) insertion.

unstable_angina_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Unstable Angina with Acute Heart Failure
  presenting_complaint: Chest pain and sudden onset breathlessness
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male with a history of ischaemic cardiomyopathy presented with rest pain followed by acute orthopnoea. Clinical examination revealed bilateral basal crackles and a third heart sound, consistent with pulmonary oedema. While troponins remained negative, dynamic ECG changes and clinical instability confirmed a diagnosis of unstable angina complicated by acute left ventricular failure. He was managed with IV nitrates, furosemide, and urgent revascularisation.

unstable_angina_007:
  primary_diagnosis: New-onset Severe Angina
  presenting_complaint: Severe chest pain on minimal exertion
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old previously healthy female presented with a three-day history of "tightness" in her chest when walking short distances, which had progressed to pain while dressing. She had no prior cardiac history but a strong family history of premature coronary artery disease. ECG showed non-specific ST-T changes, and serial troponins were negative. She was diagnosed with new-onset severe unstable angina and started on a beta-blocker, statin, and DAPT, with a plan for early invasive strategy.

unstable_angina_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Unstable Angina (Cocaine-induced)
  presenting_complaint: Acute pleuritic-type chest pain
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male presented with sharp chest pain following the use of intranasal cocaine. ECG demonstrated transient ST-segment elevation in the lateral leads which resolved within 30 minutes of administration of intravenous benzodiazepines. Serial troponins were negative, excluding myocardial infarction. The presentation was consistent with cocaine-induced coronary vasospasm presenting as unstable angina, and he was discharged after 24 hours of observation with drug cessation counselling.

unstable_angina_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Unstable Angina in Chronic Kidney Disease
  presenting_complaint: Uraemic symptoms and exertional chest pain
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with Stage 4 CKD presented with worsening exertional angina and fluid overload. His baseline troponin was chronically elevated (45 ng/L) but did not show a significant rise-and-fall pattern (delta < 20%). ECG showed chronic LBBB, making ischaemia detection difficult. Due to the increasing frequency of symptoms at low-level activity, he was treated for unstable angina with cautious medical management, avoiding nephrotoxic contrast where possible until clinical stabilisation.

unstable_angina_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Unstable Angina
  presenting_complaint: Persistent chest pain despite medical therapy
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female was admitted with unstable angina and started on standard medical therapy including aspirin, ticagrelor, and intravenous nitrates. Despite maximal medical management, she continued to experience recurrent episodes of rest pain and dynamic ST-segment depression. She was transferred to the ICU for an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) to provide haemodynamic support and bridge her to urgent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

unstable_angina_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Unstable Angina (Post-CABG)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent angina 10 years after bypass
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male with a history of triple vessel CABG in 2014 presented with a two-week history of increasing GTN use for rest pain. ECG showed old Q-waves but no new ischaemic changes; troponins were negative. Angiography via the radial artery demonstrated occlusion of the saphenous vein graft to the RCA, while the LIMA to LAD remained patent. He was managed by optimising medical therapy as he was deemed high-risk for redo-surgery.

unstable_angina_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Unstable Angina (Tachycardia-mediated)
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations and retrosternal pressure
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old female presented with a rapid heart rate and associated chest pressure. ECG confirmed atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 160 bpm and associated ST depression in the lateral leads. Once the heart rate was controlled with intravenous metoprolol, the chest pain and ST changes resolved. Serial troponins were negative, and the episode was diagnosed as unstable angina precipitated by rapid atrial fibrillation in the context of underlying coronary artery disease.

unstable_angina_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute Unstable Angina
  presenting_complaint: Increasing frequency of nocturnal chest pain
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male reported waking up three times a week with chest tightness that was relieved by sitting up and using GTN spray. He had a history of stable angina but noted this change over the last month. Outpatient review and a negative troponin test at the local clinic led to an urgent referral to the Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinic (RACPC). He was diagnosed with subacute unstable angina and his medication was up-titrated while awaiting an urgent stress echocardiogram.

unstable_angina_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Unstable Angina (Prinzmetal Variant)
  presenting_complaint: Early morning chest pain at rest
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female presented with severe retrosternal pain occurring at 4 AM daily. ECG during an episode showed transient ST elevation in the inferior leads, which rapidly normalised after sublingual GTN. Serial troponins were negative. Coronary angiography showed no fixed obstructive lesions, but provocative testing confirmed coronary vasospasm. She was diagnosed with Prinzmetal (variant) angina presenting as an unstable pattern and was successfully treated with calcium channel blockers.

unstable_angina_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Unstable Angina (Diagnostic Challenge)
  presenting_complaint: Left arm ache and shortness of breath
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female with a history of osteoarthritis presented with persistent left arm aching and mild dyspnoea. She denied "chest pain" but admitted the ache worsened when walking. Initial ECG was unremarkable and troponins were negative. Due to her age and risk factors, a CT coronary angiogram was performed, revealing a heavily calcified and significantly stenosed circumflex artery. Her symptoms were re-classified as an anginal equivalent, specifically unstable angina due to the rest symptoms.

unstable_angina_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Unstable Angina (Post-operative)
  presenting_complaint: Post-operative chest tightness
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old male developed chest tightness and diaphoresis on the second day following an elective hip arthroplasty. ECG showed new-onset T-wave inversion in the precordial leads. Serial troponins remained negative, but the clinical picture and ECG changes were consistent with unstable angina triggered by the physiological stress of surgery. He was managed with cautious anticoagulation and beta-blockade, avoiding aggressive DAPT due to recent major surgery.

unstable_angina_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Unstable Angina (Triple Vessel Disease)
  presenting_complaint: Syncope and chest pressure
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old male presented following a syncopal episode preceded by chest pressure. ECG showed widespread ST depression and ST elevation in aVR, suggesting left main or triple vessel disease. Troponins were marginally elevated but did not meet the MI criteria for his age and gender. He was stabilised on an infusion of glyceryl trinitrate and underwent urgent angiography, which confirmed severe triple vessel disease; he was subsequently referred for urgent CABG.

unstable_angina_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Unstable Angina (Treatment Failure)
  presenting_complaint: Worsening pain despite optimal medical therapy
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old male with known CAD was admitted with unstable angina. Despite being on aspirin, clopidogrel, bisoprolol, and isosorbide mononitrate, he continued to have daily episodes of rest pain. Troponins remained negative. A repeat angiogram showed a new 90% lesion in the proximal RCA that had progressed rapidly from a 30% lesion six months prior. He underwent successful PCI with a drug-eluting stent.

unstable_angina_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Unstable Angina (Silent Ischaemia)
  presenting_complaint: Profound fatigue and jaw discomfort
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old diabetic male presented with sudden onset of profound fatigue and intermittent jaw ache over 48 hours. He denied any chest pain. ECG showed dynamic ST-segment changes during an episode of jaw pain in the A&E department. Serial troponins were negative. He was diagnosed with unstable angina presenting with atypical "anginal equivalents," common in diabetic patients, and was started on aggressive medical therapy.

unstable_angina_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Unstable Angina (Acute-on-chronic)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden decrease in exercise tolerance
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female with long-standing stable angina (CCS Class II) presented with a sudden transition to CCS Class IV symptoms, experiencing pain while walking to the bathroom. ECG showed no acute changes, and troponins were negative. This acute-on-chronic presentation was managed as unstable angina. She was admitted for inpatient stabilisation and underwent an elective-turned-urgent PCI to a culprit lesion in the obtuse marginal branch.
