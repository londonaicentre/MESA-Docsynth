  primary_diagnosis: Compartment syndrome of the foot secondary to crush injury
  presenting_complaint: Excruciating pain out of proportion to clinical findings and paraesthesia in the toes.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old warehouse worker had his foot crushed by a forklift, resulting in multiple metatarsal fractures. Despite analgesia, pain worsened, and compartment pressures were elevated (>30mmHg). He underwent emergency fasciotomies of the foot compartments to prevent ischaemic necrosis, followed by delayed primary closure.

fracture_of_foot_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Non-union of a Jones fracture
  presenting_complaint: Persistent lateral foot pain and "clicking" sensation four months after initial injury.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old semi-professional footballer was previously treated conservatively for a fifth metatarsal base fracture (Zone 2).

fracture_of_foot_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Talar neck fracture (Hawkins Type II)
  presenting_complaint: Severe ankle and midfoot pain following a fall from height.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old male presented with a displaced talar neck fracture with subluxation of the subtalar joint. Due to the high risk of avascular necrosis (AVN), he underwent urgent ORIF. Serial MRI scans at 6 and 12 months showed no signs of Hawkins sign, confirming the development of AVN, which required subsequent arthrodesis.

fracture_of_foot_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Navicular stress fracture
  presenting_complaint: Vague, aching midfoot pain in a professional sprinter.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male athlete complained of "N-spot" tenderness over the dorsal navicular. CT imaging confirmed a non-displaced sagittal stress fracture. He was treated with six weeks of non-weight-bearing in a cast, as conservative weight-bearing management carries a high risk of non-union for this vascularly compromised bone.

fracture_of_foot_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Malunion of a proximal phalanx fracture
  presenting_complaint: Deformity of the fourth toe and difficulty fitting into shoes.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female sustained a "nightwalker" fracture (stubbed toe) three months prior, which was not medically assessed. The fracture healed with significant rotational deformity. She underwent a corrective osteotomy and K-wire fixation to restore alignment and relieve symptomatic pressure.

fracture_of_foot_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Pathological fracture of the calcaneus
  presenting_complaint: Sudden heel pain during normal walking without preceding trauma.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer presented with acute heel pain. Imaging revealed a lytic lesion occupying 60% of the calcaneal body with a pathological fracture line. He was managed with a walking boot for stability and referred for palliative radiotherapy and bisphosphonate therapy.

fracture_of_foot_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Avulsion fracture of the calcaneal tuberosity
  presenting_complaint: Sharp pain in the posterior heel and inability to perform a heel-rise.
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old female with long-standing Achilles tendinopathy felt a "pop" while stepping up a kerb. X-ray showed a "beak" fracture of the posterior calcaneus where the Achilles tendon inserts. Due to the risk of skin necrosis from the displaced fragment, she underwent urgent surgical reduction and lag screw fixation.

fracture_of_foot_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Cuboid "nutcracker" fracture
  presenting_complaint: Lateral midfoot pain and swelling after a horse-riding accident where the foot was caught in a stirrup.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female sustained a forced abduction injury of the forefoot. Radiographs and CT showed a comminuted compression fracture of the cuboid with shortening of the lateral column. She required an external fixator and bone grafting to restore the length of the lateral column and prevent late flatfoot deformity.

fracture_of_foot_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic osteomyelitis following an open foot fracture
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent sinus tract drainage and persistent pain over the first metatarsal.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male had sustained an open fracture 12 months prior. Despite initial healing, he developed a discharging sinus. MRI showed sequestrum formation within the metatarsal head. He required surgical debridement, removal of hardware, and a six-week course of culture-specific intravenous antibiotics.

  primary_diagnosis: Bilateral calcaneal fractures with associated lumbar burst fracture
  presenting_complaint: Severe bilateral heel pain and lower back pain after a suicide attempt (jump from height).
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male was admitted via the trauma pathway. Imaging confirmed bilateral comminuted calcaneal fractures and an L2 burst fracture (Don Juan syndrome). He was managed in the ICU for polytrauma before undergoing staged spinal stabilisation and bilateral calcaneal ORIF once soft tissue swelling subsided.

fracture_of_foot_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Sesamoid fracture (medial sesamoid)
  presenting_complaint: Sharp pain under the ball of the great toe, exacerbated by walking barefoot.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old ballet dancer presented with localised tenderness over the hallucal sesamoids. Radiographs showed a fragmented medial sesamoid; a bone scan was used to differentiate a true fracture from a bipartite sesamoid. She was treated with a dancer's pad, orthotics, and a period of reduced activity.

fracture_of_foot_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) Type 1 post-fracture
  presenting_complaint: Burning pain, skin colour changes, and extreme sensitivity to touch following a simple metatarsal fracture.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female's second metatarsal fracture healed well radiographically by 8 weeks, but she developed progressive allodynia and vasomotor instability. She was diagnosed with CRPS based on Budapest criteria. Management involved multidisciplinary input from the pain clinic, intensive desensitisation physiotherapy, and neuropathic analgesia.

fracture_of_foot_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Multiple tarsal fractures in a polytrauma patient
  presenting_complaint: Gross deformity and instability of the midfoot following an industrial crush injury.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male was brought to the ED after a heavy crate fell on his foot. Imaging revealed fractures of the navicular, cuneiforms, and cuboid. He was initially stabilised with an external fixator to allow for soft tissue recovery ("span-then-scan" protocol) before definitive internal fixation was performed 14 days later.
