hepatic_encephalopathy_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic hepatic encephalopathy (Grade 2)
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, reversal of sleep-wake cycle, and flapping tremor.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with known alcoholic cirrhosis presented to A&E with progressive disorientation and drowsiness. Physical examination revealed jaundice, ascites, and a prominent asterixis. Bloods showed an ammonia level of 110 µmol/L and a raised INR; he was treated with regular lactulose and phosphate enemas, leading to a significant improvement in mental state within 48 hours.

hepatic_encephalopathy_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Fulminant hepatic encephalopathy (Grade 4)
  presenting_complaint: Comatose state following paracetamol overdose.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female was admitted to ICU 72 hours post-ingestion of 30g paracetamol with a GCS of 6. She required immediate intubation and ventilation for airway protection and management of suspected cerebral oedema. Despite N-acetylcysteine therapy, she progressed to multi-organ failure and was urgently listed for a super-urgent liver transplant.

hepatic_encephalopathy_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Minimal hepatic encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty concentrating and subtle coordination issues while driving.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with NAFLD-associated cirrhosis complained of "brain fog" and a recent minor car wing-mirror clip. While his standard neurological exam was unremarkable, formal psychometric testing (PHES) confirmed impaired cognitive processing speed. He was commenced on low-dose lactulose as an outpatient, which resolved his symptoms and improved his quality of life.

hepatic_encephalopathy_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-TIPS hepatic encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of stupor following shunt procedure.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male underwent a Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) for refractory ascites. Within three weeks, he experienced three hospital admissions for Grade 3 encephalopathy despite adherence to rifaximin and lactulose. Following a multidisciplinary review, the TIPS diameter was reduced via a parallel stent, resulting in successful resolution of the neurocognitive episodes.

hepatic_encephalopathy_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Hepatic encephalopathy precipitated by infection
  presenting_complaint: Acute delirium and agitation in an elderly patient.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with compensated NASH cirrhosis was brought to the hospital with sudden onset confusion and urinary incontinence. Initial suspicion was dementia, but the presence of asterixis and a positive urine culture for E. coli pointed to a metabolic cause. Treatment of the urinary tract infection and temporary aperients led to a full recovery of her baseline mental function.

hepatic_encephalopathy_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric hepatic encephalopathy secondary to Wilson's disease
  presenting_complaint: Irritability, deteriorating school performance, and jaundice.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old girl presented with a two-week history of behavioural changes and yellowing of the sclera. Investigations revealed low caeruloplasmin, Kayser-Fleischer rings, and elevated transaminases. She developed Grade 2 encephalopathy during her admission, necessitating chelation therapy and careful protein titration in her diet.

hepatic_encephalopathy_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic persistent hepatic encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Constant mild cognitive impairment and lethargy.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with chronic Hepatitis C and advanced cirrhosis remained persistently confused despite maximal medical therapy. He was unable to maintain employment due to slowed speech and poor memory. He was managed in the community with a combination of lactulose, rifaximin 550mg BD, and branched-chain amino acid supplements while awaiting transplant assessment.

hepatic_encephalopathy_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Hepatic encephalopathy precipitated by constipation
  presenting_complaint: Increasing drowsiness and three days of no bowel movements.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) on a background of cirrhosis presented with worsening lethargy. She had been taking codeine for back pain, which led to severe constipation. Encephalopathy resolved rapidly after the administration of high-dose macrogol and the cessation of opiate analgesia.

hepatic_encephalopathy_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Non-cirrhotic hepatic encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent confusion with normal liver function tests.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented with episodic disorientation and a high serum ammonia level. CT imaging revealed a large spontaneous splenorenal shunt in the absence of significant hepatic fibrosis or portal hypertension. The encephalopathy was successfully treated by radiological embolisation of the shunt, after which his symptoms disappeared entirely.

hepatic_encephalopathy_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Hepatic encephalopathy with cerebral oedema
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressing coma and extensor posturing.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male with acute Hepatitis A infection deteriorated from Grade 2 to Grade 4 encephalopathy within six hours. Head CT showed evidence of raised intracranial pressure and effacement of sulci. He was managed in the ICU with hypertonic saline boluses, targeted temperature management, and continuous veno-venous haemofiltration to lower ammonia levels.

hepatic_encephalopathy_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Sedative-induced hepatic encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Unresponsiveness after taking sleep medication.
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male with known cirrhosis took 10mg of diazepam for insomnia. He was found the next morning in a state of stupor with a GCS of 9. He required flumazenil reversal and supportive care; the case highlighted the danger of benzodiazepine use in patients with impaired hepatic clearance.

hepatic_encephalopathy_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Hepatic encephalopathy secondary to Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP)
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal pain, distension, and mild confusion.
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old female with ascites presented with Grade 1 encephalopathy and diffuse abdominal tenderness. Diagnostic paracentesis confirmed SBP with a neutrophilic count >250 cells/mm³. She was treated with intravenous cefotaxime and albumin infusions (1.5g/kg), which prevented hepatorenal syndrome and resolved the encephalopathic state.

hepatic_encephalopathy_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Late-onset Urea Cycle Disorder mimicking HE
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of bizarre behaviour after high-protein meals.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old female was repeatedly admitted with "hepatic encephalopathy" despite having no evidence of liver disease on biopsy or fibroscan. Advanced metabolic screening revealed a partial Ornithine Transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency. This diagnostic challenge was managed with a low-protein diet and nitrogen-scavenging agents, rather than standard cirrhosis treatments.

hepatic_encephalopathy_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Hepatic encephalopathy in Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy (AFLP)
  presenting_complaint: Nausea, vomiting, and confusion in the third trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old primigravida at 36 weeks gestation presented with acute liver failure and Grade 2 encephalopathy. Urgent delivery by Caesarean section was performed to stabilise both mother and neonate. Her hepatic function and mental state improved rapidly postpartum, confirming the diagnosis of AFLP.

hepatic_encephalopathy_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Hepatic encephalopathy masked by Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Tremor, tachycardia, and hallucinations.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male with heavy daily alcohol intake presented in an agitated state. While initially treated for Delirium Tremens, the failure to respond to high-dose benzodiazepines and a rising ammonia level suggested a component of HE. Once Chlordiazepoxide was reduced and lactulose started, his agitation subsided, revealing an underlying Grade 2 encephalopathy.

hepatic_encephalopathy_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Hepatic encephalopathy presenting as focal neurological deficit
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset right-sided weakness and dysphasia.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with MASLD-cirrhosis was brought in as a "stroke alert." CT brain and MRI were negative for ischaemia, but blood tests showed significant hyperammonaemia and deranged LFTs. The focal signs, known as "hepatic hemiplegia," resolved completely following aggressive treatment for hepatic encephalopathy with bowel cleansing.

hepatic_encephalopathy_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Hepatic encephalopathy precipitated by GI Haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Melaena and profound lethargy.
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male with known varices presented with black, tarry stools and Grade 3 encephalopathy. The protein load from digested blood in the gastrointestinal tract acted as a major precipitant. Following endoscopic band ligation of oesophageal varices and gut decontamination, his cognitive status returned to baseline.

hepatic_encephalopathy_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-operative hepatic encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Confusion and drowsiness following elective hip surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female with stable, compensated cirrhosis underwent a total hip replacement. Post-operatively, she developed acute confusion secondary to the combined effects of dehydration, starvation, and anaesthetic agents. Rehydration and re-introduction of her regular lactulose regimen via nasogastric tube resolved the HE.

hepatic_encephalopathy_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Hepatic encephalopathy in Hereditary Haemochromatosis
  presenting_complaint: Slurred speech and personality changes.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with iron-overload induced cirrhosis presented with Grade 2 HE. He had been non-compliant with venesection and had developed a chest infection. He was treated with IV antibiotics and rifaximin, with a focus on long-term management of his underlying haemochromatosis to prevent further decompensation.

hepatic_encephalopathy_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory hepatic encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Monthly hospital admissions for overt confusion.
  summary_of_course: A 57-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis-related cirrhosis experienced "breakthrough" encephalopathy despite lactulose and rifaximin. Addition of oral branched-chain amino acids and a late-night protein snack were implemented to reduce muscle wasting and ammonia production. This modified nutritional approach significantly reduced her hospitalisation frequency over the following six months.
