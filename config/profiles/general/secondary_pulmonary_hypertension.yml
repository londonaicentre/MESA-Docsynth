secondary_pulmonary_hypertension_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease (Group 2 PH)
  presenting_complaint: Worsening exertional dyspnoea, orthopnoea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female with long-standing HFpEF and severe mitral regurgitation presented with NYHA Class III symptoms. Echocardiography revealed a dilated left atrium and an estimated PASP of 65 mmHg, while right heart catheterisation (RHC) confirmed a PCWP of 22 mmHg and a mean PAP of 48 mmHg. Management focused on aggressive diuresis and mitral valve repair, resulting in moderate symptomatic improvement.

secondary_pulmonary_hypertension_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Pulmonary hypertension due to COPD (Group 3 PH)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic productive cough and severe breathlessness on minimal exertion.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male smoker with GOLD Stage IV COPD presented with peripheral oedema and a prominent P2 heart sound. Investigations showed FEV1 of 32% predicted and chronic hypoxia (PaO2 7.2 kPa on room air), with echo suggesting moderate PH. He was started on long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) and optimised bronchodilators, which stabilised his pulmonary pressures.

secondary_pulmonary_hypertension_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent shortness of breath six months following a provoked pulmonary embolism.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female reported progressive exercise intolerance despite three months of anticoagulation. A V/Q scan demonstrated multiple segmental perfusion defects, and RHC confirmed pre-capillary PH (mPAP 42 mmHg, PVR 6 Wood units). She was referred to a specialist centre for successful pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA).

secondary_pulmonary_hypertension_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Eisenmenger syndrome (Group 1 PH)
  presenting_complaint: Central cyanosis, digital clubbing, and exertional syncope.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy with an unrepaired large ventricular septal defect (VSD) presented with a reversed shunt (right-to-left). Clinical examination noted an oxygen saturation of 82% at rest and polycythaemia (haemoglobin 195 g/L). He was commenced on sildenafil and bosentan to improve exercise capacity, as the defect was deemed no longer amenable to surgical closure.

secondary_pulmonary_hypertension_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Pulmonary hypertension secondary to Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA)
  presenting_complaint: Excessive daytime somnolence and loud snoring reported by partner.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with a BMI of 42 kg/m² and severe OSA (AHI 45) was found to have mild PH on screening echocardiography (PASP 40 mmHg). Nocturnal oximetry showed significant desaturations below 80% for 30% of the night. Following six months of compliant CPAP therapy and weight loss, a follow-up echo showed normalisation of right ventricular pressures.

secondary_pulmonary_hypertension_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Systemic sclerosis-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Raynaud’s phenomenon, sclerodactyly, and new-onset breathlessness.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female with limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis underwent annual screening, revealing a DLCO of 45% predicted. RHC confirmed pre-capillary PH with a mean PAP of 35 mmHg and normal PCWP. She was initiated on dual oral therapy with macitentan and tadalafil, maintaining stable NYHA Class II status.

secondary_pulmonary_hypertension_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic PH due to decompensated HFrEF
  presenting_complaint: Acute respiratory distress, bilateral leg swelling, and abdominal bloating.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with ischaemic cardiomyopathy (LVEF 25%) was admitted to the ICU with cardiogenic shock and severe secondary PH. Right-sided heart failure was prominent, with a PASP of 85 mmHg on echo and significant tricuspid regurgitation. He required IV inotropes and continuous furosemide infusion, gradually transitioning to oral sacubitril/valsartan.

secondary_pulmonary_hypertension_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Portopulmonary hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Increasing abdominal girth and dyspnoea during pre-transplant workup.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male with biopsy-proven alcoholic cirrhosis and portal hypertension was undergoing evaluation for a liver transplant. Screening echo showed a PASP of 55 mmHg, and RHC confirmed an mPAP of 38 mmHg with elevated PVR. He was started on ambrisentan to lower pulmonary pressures below the threshold required for safe transplantation.

secondary_pulmonary_hypertension_009:
  primary_diagnosis: HIV-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Progressive exertional dyspnoea and fatigue over four months.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male, HIV positive for 10 years (CD4 count 250 cells/uL, suppressed viral load), presented with signs of right heart strain. RHC demonstrated pre-capillary PH with no evidence of lung disease or left heart dysfunction. He was treated with sildenafil in addition to his antiretroviral therapy, showing a 50-metre improvement in his 6-minute walk test.

secondary_pulmonary_hypertension_010:
  primary_diagnosis: PH secondary to Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)
  presenting_complaint: Dry cough and severe oxygen desaturation on walking.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with IPF (FVC 55% predicted) developed severe PH "out of proportion" to his restrictive defect. High-resolution CT showed extensive honeycombing, and echo suggested a PASP of 70 mmHg. Given the poor prognosis and lack of response to nintedanib, he was referred for palliative symptom management and ambulatory oxygen.

secondary_pulmonary_hypertension_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Schistosomiasis-associated pulmonary hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Breathlessness and hepatosplenomegaly in a recent migrant.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male from the Nile Delta region presented with progressive dyspnoea and signs of portal hypertension. Serology was positive for Schistosoma mansoni, and RHC confirmed pre-capillary PH, likely due to vascular remodelling from egg deposition. He received praziquantel and was started on sildenafil, showing partial haemodynamic recovery.

secondary_pulmonary_hypertension_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Sickle cell disease-associated pulmonary hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent chest pain and worsening exercise tolerance.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female with HbSS genotype and frequent vaso-occlusive crises was found to have a tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity of 3.2 m/s. Investigations revealed chronic haemolysis and mild PH on RHC (mPAP 28 mmHg). Management was escalated to include hydroxycarbamide and regular exchange transfusions to reduce the risk of further vascular damage.

secondary_pulmonary_hypertension_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Sarcoidosis-associated pulmonary hypertension (Group 5 PH)
  presenting_complaint: Exertional dyspnoea and persistent dry cough.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with Stage IV pulmonary sarcoidosis and extensive hilar lymphadenopathy developed secondary PH. The mechanism was multifactorial, involving extrinsic compression of pulmonary arteries and parenchymal destruction. Despite high-dose prednisolone and methotrexate, her PH progressed, requiring the addition of inhaled iloprost.

secondary_pulmonary_hypertension_014:
  primary_diagnosis: PH secondary to Rheumatic Mitral Stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations, haemoptysis, and NYHA Class IV dyspnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female with a history of childhood rheumatic fever presented in atrial fibrillation with severe mitral stenosis (valve area 0.8 cm²). Echocardiography showed a PASP of 80 mmHg and a heavily calcified valve. Following a successful mechanical mitral valve replacement, her PASP decreased to 35 mmHg within three months.

secondary_pulmonary_hypertension_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Drug-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension (Aminorex)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of exertional syncope and chest tightness.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female who had used the appetite suppressant aminorex in the 1990s presented with late-onset severe PH. RHC showed an mPAP of 52 mmHg and a cardiac index of 1.8 L/min/m². She was managed with triple therapy (macitentan, tadalafil, and subcutaneous treprostinil) due to the severity of her presentation.

secondary_pulmonary_hypertension_016:
  primary_diagnosis: PH associated with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath during and after haemodialysis sessions.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male on haemodialysis via a high-flow left arm arteriovenous (AV) fistula presented with unexplained PH. Investigations ruled out LHD and lung disease; the PH was attributed to high cardiac output and uraemia-induced vascular changes. Revision of the AV fistula to reduce flow resulted in a significant reduction in mPAP.

secondary_pulmonary_hypertension_017:
  primary_diagnosis: PH secondary to Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD)
  presenting_complaint: Failure to thrive and persistent oxygen requirement in an infant.
  summary_of_course: A 6-month-old infant, born at 26 weeks' gestation, remained oxygen-dependent with significant lung markings on chest X-ray. Echocardiography revealed right ventricular hypertrophy and a PASP estimated at 75% of systemic pressure. He was treated with liquid sildenafil and optimised nutrition, showing gradual improvement in pulmonary pressures over several months.

secondary_pulmonary_hypertension_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Gaucher disease-associated pulmonary hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue, bone pain, and breathlessness on exertion.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old female with Type 1 Gaucher disease and massive splenomegaly was diagnosed with PH during a routine review. The PH was thought to be due to pulmonary capillary plugging by Gaucher cells and chronic inflammation. Escalation of enzyme replacement therapy (imiglucerase) and the addition of an endothelin receptor antagonist improved her haemodynamics.

secondary_pulmonary_hypertension_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Pulmonary Veno-Occlusive Disease (PVOD)
  presenting_complaint: Severe dyspnoea and haemoptysis; worsening with sildenafil.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male presented with severe pre-capillary PH and characteristic CT findings of centrilobular ground-glass opacities and septal lines. Initiation of a PDE5 inhibitor caused acute pulmonary oedema, confirming the suspicion of PVOD. He was urgently listed for a bilateral lung transplant as the only definitive treatment.

secondary_pulmonary_hypertension_020:
  primary_diagnosis: PH secondary to Essential Thrombocythaemia
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of pleuritic chest pain and breathlessness.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male with essential thrombocythaemia (JAK2 positive) presented with chronic PH. Investigations suggested a combination of chronic microvascular thrombosis and direct vascular remodelling. He was managed with cytoreductive therapy (hydroxycarbamide), aspirin, and riociguat, which led to a stabilised PVR and improved exercise tolerance.
