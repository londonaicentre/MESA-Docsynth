Examination showed granulation tissue in the external auditory canal; CT demonstrated erosion of the temporal bone. He required 12 weeks of IV ceftazidime for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and intensive glycaemic control.

osteomyelitis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Pelvic osteomyelitis secondary to pressure sores
  presenting_complaint: Foul-smelling discharge from a deep sacral ulcer.
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old bedbound female with advanced dementia presented with a Grade IV sacral pressure sore. MRI confirmed extension of infection into the coccyx and sacrum with associated marrow oedema. Management was palliative, focusing on wound care and oral suppressive antibiotics due to her significant surgical risks.
