aortic_aneurysm_without_rupture_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Large descending thoracic aortic aneurysm
  presenting_complaint: New onset of hoarseness and dry cough
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old female presented with a three-week history of hoarseness. Laryngoscopy confirmed left vocal cord palsy, and a CT chest revealed a 7.2 cm descending thoracic aortic aneurysm compressing the recurrent laryngeal nerve.

aortic_aneurysm_without_rupture_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric aortic root aneurysm
  presenting_complaint: Routine follow-up for Loeys-Dietz syndrome
  summary_of_course: A 9-year-old boy with known Loeys-Dietz syndrome underwent annual cardiac surveillance.

  presenting_complaint: Routine post-EVAR surveillance scan
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old male, five years post-EVAR for a 5.5 cm AAA, underwent a routine surveillance CT. The scan showed the aneurysm sac had increased from 5.8 cm to 6.4 cm since the previous year, with evidence of retrograde flow from the inferior mesenteric artery. He was admitted for mesenteric artery embolisation to halt the progressive sac expansion.

He received a course of intramuscular penicillin and was referred for elective aortic root and arch replacement.

aortic_aneurysm_without_rupture_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Saccular aortic arch aneurysm
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding on CT pulmonary angiogram
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old female underwent a CTPA to rule out pulmonary embolism. The scan was negative for PE but identified a 5.2 cm saccular aneurysm of the aortic arch, distal to the left subclavian artery. Given the saccular morphology and high risk of rupture despite the size, she was referred for Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair (TEVAR).

  primary_diagnosis: Takayasu arteritis with aortic involvement
  presenting_complaint: Arm claudication and absent radial pulses
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old female presented with bilateral arm fatigue and syncopal episodes. Clinical examination noted absent radial pulses and a bruit over the abdominal aorta; MRA revealed multiple stenotic segments and a 4.2 cm fusiform aneurysm of the suprarenal abdominal aorta.

  primary_diagnosis: Chronic aortic dissection with aneurysmal degeneration
  presenting_complaint: Routine follow-up for Type B dissection
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with a history of a Type B aortic dissection managed medically three years ago presented for follow-up. CTA showed the false lumen in the descending aorta had expanded to 6.1 cm, meeting the threshold for intervention. He underwent successful TEVAR to cover the primary entry tear and promote false lumen thrombosis.

aortic_aneurysm_without_rupture_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Rapidly expanding abdominal aortic aneurysm
  presenting_complaint: No symptoms, but rapid growth on surveillance
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male on a 6-monthly surveillance programme for a 4.5 cm AAA was found to have a growth of 1.2 cm in six months, with the aneurysm now measuring 5.7 cm. Due to the rapid expansion rate (>1 cm/year), he was fast-tracked for elective surgical assessment. He successfully underwent an open repair with a bifurcated Dacron graft.

aortic_aneurysm_without_rupture_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Aneurysm of the Sinus of Valsalva
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations and mild chest discomfort
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male presented with intermittent palpitations; a cardiac MRI identified a 4.0 cm aneurysm of the right sinus of Valsalva. The aneurysm was not ruptured and there was no evidence of a shunt into the right heart chambers. He was scheduled for elective surgical repair to prevent future rupture or interference with the conduction system.

aortic_aneurysm_without_rupture_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Infected (mycotic) thoracic aortic aneurysm
  presenting_complaint: Back pain, rigors, and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old female with a recent history of Salmonella gastroenteritis presented with persistent mid-back pain and night sweats. CTA showed a 3.5 cm lobulated aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta with peri-aortic fluid. She was treated with targeted IV antibiotics for six weeks followed by a TEVAR procedure to stabilise the weakened aortic wall.

  primary_diagnosis: Huge abdominal aortic aneurysm in a frail patient
  presenting_complaint: Pulsatile abdominal mass found by patient
  summary_of_course: An 89-year-old male with severe COPD and NYHA Class IV heart failure noticed a "thumping" sensation in his abdomen. Examination revealed a large pulsatile mass, and ultrasound confirmed a 9.5 cm AAA. Following a multidisciplinary team discussion and consultation with the patient regarding the extreme risks of surgery, a decision was made for conservative, palliative management.
