pancreatic_pseudocyst_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-acute pancreatic pseudocyst
  presenting_complaint: Persistent epigastric pain and early satiety
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented six weeks after an episode of severe gallstone pancreatitis. CT abdomen revealed a 7cm well-circumscribed fluid collection in the pancreatic body. Given the persistence of symptoms, he underwent successful EUS-guided cystogastrostomy with resolution of the cyst on follow-up imaging at three months.

pancreatic_pseudocyst_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic alcoholic pancreatic pseudocyst
  presenting_complaint: Chronic dull abdominal pain and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with a long history of alcohol excess and chronic calcific pancreatitis presented with worsening mid-abdominal pain. Imaging identified a 5cm pseudocyst in the tail of the pancreas and splenic vein thrombosis. He was managed conservatively with alcohol cessation support and enzyme replacement, showing gradual cyst involution.

pancreatic_pseudocyst_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Traumatic pancreatic pseudocyst
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal distension and vomiting following blunt trauma
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old boy presented four weeks after a bicycle handlebar injury to the epigastrium. Ultrasound confirmed a large 10cm pseudocyst compressing the stomach. Due to persistent gastric outlet obstruction, he underwent surgical cystojejunostomy, leading to a full recovery and return to normal diet.

pancreatic_pseudocyst_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Haemorrhagic pancreatic pseudocyst
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset severe abdominal pain and syncope
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female with known chronic pancreatitis presented in haemorrhagic shock. Urgent CT angiography revealed a pseudoaneurysm of the splenic artery that had ruptured into a pre-existing pseudocyst. She was treated with emergency coil embolisation by interventional radiology and required four units of packed red cells.

pancreatic_pseudocyst_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Infected pancreatic pseudocyst
  presenting_complaint: Fever, rigors, and worsening epigastric tenderness
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male, eight weeks post-necrotising pancreatitis, developed systemic inflammatory response syndrome. CT showed gas bubbles within a 12cm pancreatic collection, suggesting secondary infection. He was treated with intravenous meropenem and percutaneous catheter drainage, resulting in clinical stabilisation and eventual cyst resolution.

pancreatic_pseudocyst_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Pancreatic pseudocyst causing biliary obstruction
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice, dark urine, and pruritus
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female presented with obstructive jaundice and a palpable epigastric mass. MRCP demonstrated a large pseudocyst in the pancreatic head causing extrinsic compression of the common bile duct. She underwent EUS-guided drainage of the cyst, which immediately relieved the biliary obstruction and normalised her bilirubin levels.

pancreatic_pseudocyst_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Pancreaticopleural fistula with pseudocyst
  presenting_complaint: Progressive dyspnoea and left-sided pleuritic chest pain
  summary_of_course: A 49-year-old male with chronic pancreatitis presented with a large left-sided pleural effusion. Thoracentesis revealed an amylase level >20,000 U/L, and CT showed a small mediastinal pseudocyst communicating with the pleural space. He was managed with octreotide, ERCP with pancreatic duct stenting, and chest tube drainage.

pancreatic_pseudocyst_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic pancreatic pseudocyst
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding on staging CT for prostate cancer
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male was found to have a 3.5cm fluid collection in the pancreatic tail on routine imaging. He had no prior history of pancreatitis or abdominal symptoms. Following EUS-FNA which showed high amylase but low CEA levels, a diagnosis of a simple pseudocyst was made, and a 'watch and wait' approach was adopted.

pancreatic_pseudocyst_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Ruptured pancreatic pseudocyst
  presenting_complaint: Sudden relief of pain followed by increasing abdominal girth
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female with a known 8cm pseudocyst experienced sudden abdominal "popping" followed by diffuse swelling. Clinical examination and paracentesis confirmed pancreatic ascites due to intraperitoneal rupture of the cyst. She was managed with total parenteral nutrition and ERCP to bridge the underlying ductal leak.

pancreatic_pseudocyst_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent pancreatic pseudocyst
  presenting_complaint: Recurrence of epigastric pain after previous drainage
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented with return of symptoms three months after percutaneous drainage of a pseudocyst. Repeat imaging showed the cyst had re-accumulated to 9cm. He was diagnosed with disconnected duct syndrome and required permanent transmural drainage using a lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS).

pancreatic_pseudocyst_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Pancreatic pseudocyst with gastric outlet obstruction
  presenting_complaint: Projectile vomiting and profound dehydration
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis presented with inability to tolerate oral intake. A 15cm giant pseudocyst was found to be completely occluding the gastric antrum. Following fluid resuscitation, he underwent urgent EUS-guided cystogastrostomy, allowing for rapid symptomatic relief and resumption of enteral feeding.

pancreatic_pseudocyst_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Mediastinal pancreatic pseudocyst
  presenting_complaint: Dysphagia and retrosternal chest pain
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male presented with difficulty swallowing and atypical chest pain. Imaging revealed a pseudocyst originating from the pancreatic body tracking through the oesophageal hiatus into the posterior mediastinum. The patient was successfully treated with trans-papillary stenting of the pancreatic duct via ERCP.

pancreatic_pseudocyst_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Pancreatic pseudocyst in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Severe upper abdominal pain at 26 weeks gestation
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old pregnant female with a history of hypertriglyceridaemia-induced pancreatitis presented with a symptomatic 6cm pseudocyst. To avoid foetal radiation and surgical risks, she was managed conservatively with parenteral nutrition and analgesia. The cyst remained stable, allowing for a successful term delivery before definitive endoscopic intervention was performed postpartum.

pancreatic_pseudocyst_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Pancreatic pseudocyst with splenic infarction
  presenting_complaint: Left upper quadrant pain radiating to the shoulder
  summary_of_course: A 51-year-old male with chronic pancreatitis presented with acute left-sided pain. CT showed a pseudocyst in the pancreatic tail that had eroded into the splenic hilum, causing segmental splenic infarction. He was treated with anticoagulation for associated venous thrombosis and underwent a distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy.

pancreatic_pseudocyst_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Multiple pancreatic pseudocysts
  presenting_complaint: Diffuse abdominal discomfort and bloating
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old female survivor of severe idiopathic pancreatitis presented with multiple fluid collections (4cm, 5cm, and 8cm) throughout the gland. Due to the multi-loculated nature and varying locations, she required a combination of EUS-guided drainage of the largest cyst and expectant management of the smaller, asymptomatic ones.

pancreatic_pseudocyst_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Pancreatic pseudocyst mimicking cystic neoplasm
  presenting_complaint: Vague abdominal discomfort and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female with no history of pancreatitis was found to have a 5cm cystic lesion in the pancreatic neck. Initial suspicion of a mucinous cystic neoplasm was high; however, EUS-FNA fluid analysis showed very high amylase and absence of mucin or malignant cells. Retrospective history suggested a forgotten episode of "heavy flu" with abdominal pain, confirming a pseudocyst.

pancreatic_pseudocyst_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Disconnected duct syndrome with pseudocyst
  presenting_complaint: Persistent drainage from a percutaneous site
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male had a percutaneous drain placed for a pseudocyst following necrotising pancreatitis. The drain continued to output high volumes of amylase-rich fluid for over six weeks. MRCP confirmed a complete transection of the pancreatic duct, necessitating internal drainage via EUS-guided cystogastrostomy to allow the external fistula to heal.

pancreatic_pseudocyst_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Pancreatic pseudocyst with colonic fistula
  presenting_complaint: Diarrhoea containing undigested food and fever
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male with chronic pancreatitis presented with features of a colo-pancreatic fistula. Imaging showed a pseudocyst had eroded into the splenic flexure of the colon. He required a staged approach with an initial diverting colostomy followed by distal pancreatectomy and colonic resection once the inflammatory process had subsided.

pancreatic_pseudocyst_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Pancreatic pseudocyst in a paediatric patient (idiopathic)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic abdominal pain and poor weight gain
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old girl with no history of trauma or known pancreatitis presented with failure to thrive. Investigations revealed a 7cm pseudocyst in the pancreatic body and evidence of hereditary pancreatitis (PRSS1 mutation). She was managed with EUS-guided internal drainage and started on long-term pancreatic enzyme supplementation.

pancreatic_pseudocyst_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Large pseudocyst in the setting of autoimmune pancreatitis
  presenting_complaint: Epigastric fullness and obstructive jaundice
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male with Type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis (IgG4-related disease) developed a 9cm pseudocyst during a disease flare. Unlike typical pseudocysts, this showed partial regression following high-dose corticosteroid therapy, although EUS-guided drainage was eventually required due to persistent biliary compression.
