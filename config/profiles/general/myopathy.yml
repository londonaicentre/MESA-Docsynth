  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented with subacute weakness in her shoulders and hips, accompanied by a heliotrope rash and Gottron papules on her knuckles. MRI of the thighs showed extensive muscle oedema, and muscle biopsy confirmed inflammatory infiltrates. She responded well to high-dose oral prednisolone and methotrexate.

myopathy_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Statin-induced myopathy
  presenting_complaint: Diffuse muscle aches and weakness
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male, recently started on atorvastatin 40mg, reported severe myalgia and difficulty climbing stairs. Laboratory tests showed a CK of 4,500 IU/L and mild renal impairment. Symptoms and biochemical markers resolved within three weeks of discontinuing the statin therapy.

  primary_diagnosis: Pompe disease (Late-onset)
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath and pelvic girdle weakness
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female presented with progressive difficulty rising from chairs and new-onset nocturnal dyspnoea.

  presenting_complaint: Inability to whistle and prominent shoulder blades
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male noted difficulty closing his eyes fully and asymmetric weakness in his upper arms. Examination revealed marked scapular winging and horizontal clavicles. Genetic testing confirmed a D4Z4 contraction on chromosome 4, and he was managed conservatively with physical therapy.

myopathy_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Steroid-induced myopathy
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty standing up from a seated position
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female with rheumatoid arthritis on long-term high-dose prednisolone (20mg daily) developed progressive proximal leg weakness without myalgia. CK levels were normal, and EMG showed low-amplitude, short-duration MUAPs. Her weakness improved significantly following a slow steroid taper and transition to steroid-sparing agents.

myopathy_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypokalaemic periodic paralysis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of generalised paralysis
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male was admitted to the emergency department after waking up unable to move his limbs following a high-carbohydrate meal. Serum potassium was 2.1 mmol/L during the attack. His strength returned to normal within hours of potassium supplementation, and genetic testing identified a mutation in the CACNA1S gene.

myopathy_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Mitochondrial myopathy
  presenting_complaint: Exercise intolerance and drooping eyelids
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old female presented with chronic fatigue, bilateral ptosis, and limited eye movements (CPEO). Resting lactate was elevated, and a muscle biopsy showed "ragged red fibres" on Gomori trichrome stain. Genetic analysis identified a large-scale mitochondrial DNA deletion.

myopathy_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Immune-mediated necrotising myopathy
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive, severe limb weakness
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male presented with acute-onset inability to walk and severe dysphagia. Serum CK was 15,000 IU/L, and serology was positive for anti-HMGCR antibodies despite no recent statin use. He required aggressive immunosuppression with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and rituximab to achieve remission.

  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic myopathy (Acute)
  presenting_complaint: Severe muscle pain and dark urine
  summary_of_course: A 46-year-old male with chronic alcohol dependence presented following a heavy binge with muscle tenderness and tea-coloured urine. CK was 42,000 IU/L, and he was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis and acute tubular necrosis. He was treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation and required temporary haemodialysis.

myopathy_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Becker muscular dystrophy

  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old male was referred due to persistent toe-walking and exercise-induced muscle cramps. Examination showed pseudohypertrophy of the calves and mild proximal weakness. A muscle biopsy showed reduced but present dystrophin staining, and genetic testing confirmed an in-frame deletion in the DMD gene.

myopathy_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type R1
  presenting_complaint: Progressive hip weakness
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female presented with a three-year history of difficulty running and climbing stairs. CK was moderately elevated at 2,500 IU/L. Genetic sequencing identified biallelic mutations in the CAPN3 gene (Calpain-3), and she was enrolled in a specialist neuromuscular monitoring programme.

myopathy_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Viral myositis
  presenting_complaint: Severe calf pain and refusal to walk
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old female developed acute, intense pain in both calves three days after the onset of influenza B symptoms. Laboratory tests showed a CK of 3,800 IU/L. The condition was diagnosed as benign acute childhood myositis, and symptoms resolved completely within a week with simple analgesia and hydration.

myopathy_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Polymyositis
  presenting_complaint: Weakness and dry cough
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female presented with proximal muscle weakness and exertional dyspnoea. Investigations confirmed elevated CK and positive anti-Jo-1 antibodies; HRCT of the chest showed interstitial lung disease. She was treated with a combination of prednisolone and azathioprine to manage both the myopathy and the pulmonary involvement.

myopathy_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Cocaine-induced rhabdomyolysis

  primary_diagnosis: Paraneoplastic dermatomyositis
  presenting_complaint: New-onset weakness and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old female presented with classic dermatomyositis skin features and proximal weakness. Given her age and smoking history, a malignancy screen was performed, which identified an underlying stage II ovarian adenocarcinoma. Treatment of the primary tumour led to a significant improvement in her myopathic symptoms.
