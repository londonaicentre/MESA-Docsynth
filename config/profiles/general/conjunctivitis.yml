The diagnosis of medicamentosa was made; symptoms resolved after withdrawing the offending drop and substituting it with a preservative-free alternative.

conjunctivitis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Trachoma (Active)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic mild irritation and blurred vision in a migrant patient.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male recently arrived from an endemic region presented with conjunctival scarring (Arlt's line) and trichiasis. Examination of the upper lid showed active follicular inflammation (TF stage). He received a single dose of oral azithromycin and was listed for lid surgery to prevent corneal opacification from inward-turning lashes.

conjunctivitis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) ocular involvement
  presenting_complaint: Sloughing of the conjunctiva and severe ocular surface pain.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female in ICU with SJS following sulfonamide use developed haemorrhagic crusting of the lids and diffuse conjunctival membranes. Daily bedside ophthalmic debridement and amniotic membrane grafting were required to prevent total ocular surface failure. This life-threatening systemic condition resulted in permanent dry eye and corneal scarring.

conjunctivitis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid (OCP)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive redness, grittiness, and "shrinking" of the eye surface.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female presented with chronic bilateral conjunctivitis unresponsive to antibiotics. Slit-lamp exam revealed foreshortening of the inferior fornices and early symblepharon. Conjunctival biopsy confirmed basement membrane zone antibodies; she was commenced on systemic immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil to halt progression.
