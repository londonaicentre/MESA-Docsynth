anosmia_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-viral olfactory dysfunction (COVID-19)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden total loss of smell and taste for three weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female presented to her GP following a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. Physical examination of the nasal cavity was unremarkable with no obstruction. She was diagnosed with post-viral anosmia and commenced on olfactory training and a short course of intranasal corticosteroids, with partial recovery noted at six months.

anosmia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Traumatic anosmia
  presenting_complaint: Permanent loss of smell following a road traffic accident.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male sustained a significant head injury with a frontal bone fracture. CT imaging confirmed shearing of the olfactory filia at the cribriform plate. Despite neurosurgical stabilisation, the anosmia remained permanent, and he was counselled on domestic safety regarding gas leaks and food spoilage.

anosmia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis
  presenting_complaint: Progressive nasal congestion and hyposmia over two years.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with a history of asthma reported bilateral nasal obstruction and a complete inability to smell. Nasal endoscopy revealed Grade 3 polyps obstructing the olfactory cleft. He underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS), which successfully restored his sense of smell post-operatively.

anosmia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Kallmann syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Congenital absence of smell and delayed onset of puberty.
  summary_of_course: An 18-year-old male was referred to endocrinology for primary hypogonadism. MRI brain demonstrated absent olfactory bulbs and sulci, confirming a diagnosis of Kallmann syndrome. He commenced testosterone replacement therapy, though the anosmia is considered a permanent developmental feature.

anosmia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Early-stage Parkinson’s disease
  presenting_complaint: Gradual loss of smell and mild resting tremor.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female reported a five-year history of progressive hyposmia before developing a unilateral pill-rolling tremor. UPSIT (University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test) confirmed severe microsmia. She was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, with anosmia identified as a significant prodromal symptom.

anosmia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Olfactory groove meningioma
  presenting_complaint: Unilateral loss of smell and worsening headaches.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female presented with a six-month history of right-sided anosmia and subtle personality changes. Contrast-enhanced MRI revealed a large meningioma at the olfactory groove compressing the frontal lobes. She underwent a bifrontal craniotomy for tumour resection, but the ipsilateral anosmia persisted.

anosmia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Occupational toxic anosmia
  presenting_complaint: Loss of smell following chronic chemical exposure.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male factory worker involved in cadmium plating reported a subacute decline in olfactory function over twelve months. Occupational health assessment confirmed high levels of airborne cadmium exposure. Despite relocation to a different department, his anosmia remained static due to irreversible mucosal damage.

anosmia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic post-surgical anosmia
  presenting_complaint: Total loss of smell following septoplasty and turbinate reduction.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male underwent elective nasal surgery for a deviated septum. Post-operatively, he reported a total lack of smell despite the resolution of nasal obstruction. It was suspected that the olfactory neuroepithelium was damaged during high septal dissection, and the patient's symptoms failed to improve at one-year follow-up.

anosmia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Esthesioneuroblastoma
  presenting_complaint: Unilateral anosmia and occasional epistaxis.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female presented with persistent left-sided nasal blockage and loss of smell. Endoscopy identified a friable mass in the superior nasal vault, and biopsy confirmed a Kadish Stage B esthesioneuroblastoma. She was treated with craniofacial resection and adjuvant radiotherapy, resulting in permanent unilateral anosmia.

anosmia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Nutritional deficiency (Zinc)
  presenting_complaint: Altered taste and reduced smell following gastric bypass.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with a history of malabsorption following bariatric surgery presented with chronic hyposmia and dysgeusia. Serum biochemistry revealed significant zinc deficiency (6.2 µmol/L). Following three months of oral zinc gluconate supplementation, his olfactory thresholds significantly improved.

anosmia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Nasal Sarcoidosis
  presenting_complaint: Nasal crusting, epistaxis, and loss of smell.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female with known pulmonary sarcoidosis developed subacute anosmia. Nasal endoscopy showed characteristic "strawberry" appearance of the mucosa and significant crusting in the olfactory cleft. Biopsy confirmed non-caseating granulomas, and symptoms partially responded to systemic methotrexate and topical steroid irrigations.

anosmia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute thermal injury (Smoke inhalation)
  presenting_complaint: Immediate loss of smell following a house fire.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female was admitted to the ICU with severe smoke inhalation and facial burns. After extubation, she reported total anosmia, which was attributed to direct thermal damage to the olfactory neuroepithelium. While her respiratory status recovered, her sense of smell remained severely impaired at one year.

anosmia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Allergic Rhinitis
  presenting_complaint: Seasonal sneezing, rhinorrhoea, and intermittent anosmia.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy presented with chronic nasal congestion that peaked during the pollen season, leading to periods of complete anosmia. Skin prick testing showed strong reactivity to grass and tree pollen. He was managed with high-dose intranasal mometasone and antihistamines, which restored his smell during the symptomatic periods.

anosmia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA)
  presenting_complaint: Saddle nose deformity and chronic anosmia.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male presented with progressive nasal bridge collapse and a total loss of smell. Investigations showed c-ANCA positivity and renal impairment. He was diagnosed with GPA and started on rituximab and cyclophosphamide; while systemic disease stabilised, the extensive nasal destruction resulted in permanent anosmia.

anosmia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Spontaneous CSF Rhinorrhoea
  presenting_complaint: Clear fluid dripping from the nose and loss of smell.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old obese female presented with a "salty" unilateral nasal discharge and hyposmia. Beta-2 transferrin testing confirmed the fluid was cerebrospinal fluid, and imaging identified a defect in the ethmoid roof. The anosmia was likely due to the underlying skull base defect and subsequent surgical repair using a mucosal flap.

anosmia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Presbyosmia (Age-related anosmia)
  presenting_complaint: Gradual decline in the ability to smell food and flowers.
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old female was brought to the clinic by her daughter after failing to smell a gas leak in the kitchen. Clinical examination and MRI were unremarkable for pathology. She was diagnosed with presbyosmia, an age-related physiological decline, and was advised on installing additional smoke and gas detectors.

anosmia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Refsum disease
  presenting_complaint: Night blindness, ataxia, and loss of smell since childhood.
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old girl was investigated for progressive neurological symptoms and retinitis pigmentosa. Biochemical screening revealed highly elevated phytanic acid levels, confirming Refsum disease. Anosmia was identified as a characteristic early feature of this metabolic disorder, requiring a strict low-phytanic acid diet.

anosmia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Medication-induced hyposmia (Nifedipine)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden change in smell after starting new blood pressure medication.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male reported a "metallic" smell and subsequent loss of normal olfactory function two weeks after commencing Nifedipine for hypertension. No other causes were identified on ENT examination. The medication was switched to an ACE inhibitor, and his sense of smell returned to baseline within four weeks.

anosmia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Cocaine-induced midline destructive lesion (CIMDL)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic nasal pain, septal perforation, and anosmia.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old male with a history of long-term intranasal cocaine abuse presented with a large septal perforation and total anosmia. Endoscopy showed extensive necrosis of the turbinates and olfactory mucosa. Despite cessation of drug use and debridement, the anosmia remained permanent due to widespread ischaemic damage.

anosmia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-meningitic anosmia
  presenting_complaint: Loss of smell following recovery from bacterial meningitis.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy recovered from Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis but was noted by his parents to no longer respond to strong odours. Neurological assessment confirmed bilateral anosmia as a sequela of the infection, likely due to inflammatory damage to the olfactory bulbs. He was enrolled in a support program for sensory loss.
