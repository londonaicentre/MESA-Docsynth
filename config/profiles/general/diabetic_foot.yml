diabetic_foot_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Neuropathic foot ulcer
  presenting_complaint: Painless 2cm ulcer on the plantar surface of the first metatarsal head.
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old male with T2DM and known peripheral neuropathy presented to the community podiatry clinic. Examination revealed a Wagner Grade 1 ulcer with heavy callus formation but no signs of infection or ischaemia. Management involved sharp debridement, pressure offloading using a felt-and-foam dressing, and a referral for therapeutic footwear, resulting in complete healing over 8 weeks.

diabetic_foot_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Infected diabetic foot ulcer with cellulitis
  presenting_complaint: Redness, swelling, and purulent discharge from a right toe wound.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with poorly controlled T2DM (HbA1c 94 mmol/mol) presented with acute spreading erythema and a foul-smelling ulcer on the third digit. Bloods showed a CRP of 145 mg/L and leucocytosis; X-ray was negative for osteomyelitis. She was admitted for IV flucloxacillin and metronidazole, underwent bedside debridement, and was discharged on oral antibiotics once the cellulitis resolved.

diabetic_foot_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Charcot neuroarthropathy
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of a hot, swollen, and erythematous left foot without an open wound.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with long-standing T1DM and dense neuropathy presented with a foot temperature 4 degrees higher than the contralateral side. Initial X-rays were normal, but an MRI confirmed Eichenholtz Stage 0 Charcot changes in the midfoot. He was treated with immediate non-weight bearing in a total contact cast (TCC) for six months to prevent permanent "rocker-bottom" deformity.

diabetic_foot_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Necrotising fasciitis of the foot
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressing foot pain, skin discolouration, and systemic malaise.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with T2DM and obesity presented in septic shock with "dishwater" discharge and crepitus over the dorsal foot. CT imaging showed extensive gas in the soft tissue planes. She was transferred to the ICU, underwent emergency radical surgical debridement of the fascia and necrotic muscle, and required multiple skin grafts following stabilisation.

diabetic_foot_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Critical limb ischaemia with wet gangrene
  presenting_complaint: Blackening of the fourth and fifth toes with severe rest pain.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with T2DM and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) presented with necrotic digits and absent pedal pulses. An urgent CT angiogram revealed multi-level arterial occlusion in the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries. Despite an attempted fem-distal bypass, the gangrene progressed, necessitating a below-knee amputation (BKA) to prevent further systemic sepsis.

diabetic_foot_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic osteomyelitis of the hallux
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent ulceration on the tip of the great toe that "probes to bone."
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male with a 6-month history of a non-healing neuropathic ulcer underwent a "probe-to-bone" test which was positive. Plain films showed cortical erosion of the distal phalanx. He completed a 6-week course of culture-guided oral ciprofloxacin and clindamycin, which successfully resolved the infection without the need for amputation.

diabetic_foot_007:
  primary_diagnosis: MRSA-infected diabetic foot ulcer
  presenting_complaint: Non-healing ulcer on the heel with persistent yellow slough.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old resident of a nursing home with T2DM and previous MRSA colonisation presented with a Grade 3 ulcer. Deep tissue swabs grew Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. He was treated with linezolid and specialised silver-impregnated dressings, but healing was delayed by underlying venous insufficiency and poor nutritional status.

diabetic_foot_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Plantar space abscess
  presenting_complaint: Deep-seated throbbing pain and swelling in the arch of the foot.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old female with T2DM presented with a "silent" abscess that had tracked from a small interdigital fissure. Clinical examination showed significant fluctuance in the mid-plantar region despite minimal skin changes. She underwent urgent incision and drainage (I&D) in theatre, followed by negative pressure wound therapy (VAC) to facilitate granulation.

diabetic_foot_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Neuropathic burn injury
  presenting_complaint: Large blisters and skin loss on the soles of both feet.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male with T1DM and severe sensory neuropathy unknowingly walked barefoot on hot pavement during a heatwave. He presented 48 hours later with full-thickness burns that had become secondarily infected. Due to his diabetes, the wounds were slow to heal and required management in a specialist burns unit with meticulous glycaemic control.

diabetic_foot_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Ischaemic heel ulcer in ESRD
  presenting_complaint: Painful, punched-out ulcer on the posterior heel.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male on haemodialysis for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and T2DM presented with a necrotic heel lesion. Vascular assessment showed calcified "pipe-stem" arteries and an Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) of 1.4 (non-compressible). Management was focused on conservative dry gangrene care and palliative symptom control as he was not a candidate for revascularisation.

diabetic_foot_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Pseudomonas aeruginosa foot infection
  presenting_complaint: Ulcer with characteristic blue-green discharge and fruity odour.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female presented after stepping on a nail while wearing trainers. The puncture wound developed into a deep infection; cultures confirmed Pseudomonas aeruginosa. She required surgical exploration to remove a retained piece of rubber sole and was treated with IV ceftazidime, highlighting the risk of specific pathogens in puncture injuries.

diabetic_foot_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent neuropathic ulceration
  presenting_complaint: Chronic breakdown of skin over the metatarsal heads.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with T2DM and significant "claw toe" deformities experienced recurrent ulceration despite multiple successful healing episodes. Biomechanical assessment identified high peak plantar pressures. He was successfully managed long-term through a combination of digital flexor tenotomies to straighten the toes and bespoke orthotic insoles.

diabetic_foot_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Interdigital tinea pedis with secondary bacterial infection
  presenting_complaint: Itching and maceration between the toes followed by sudden swelling.
  summary_of_course: A 49-year-old female with T2DM presented with acute lymphangitis originating from the fourth web space. The primary cause was fungal maceration (athlete's foot) which provided a portal for Group A Streptococcus. Treatment involved IV benzylpenicillin for the cellulitis and topical terbinafine to address the underlying fungal infection.

diabetic_foot_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Osteomyelitis of the calcaneus
  presenting_complaint: Deep, non-healing sinus tract on the posterior aspect of the heel.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with a history of a pressure-related heel sore presented with persistent drainage. MRI confirmed extensive marrow oedema and sequestration within the calcaneus. He underwent a partial calcanectomy to remove the infected bone while preserving the Achilles tendon attachment, followed by a prolonged course of IV vancomycin.

diabetic_foot_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic foot sepsis precipitating DKA
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, vomiting, and a neglected, malodorous foot wound.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female was brought to A&E in diabetic ketoacidosis (pH 7.1, ketones 5.2 mmol/L). Physical exam revealed a severe, neglected diabetic foot infection with extensive necrosis. She was treated with the standard DKA protocol alongside aggressive fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum IV antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam) before undergoing urgent debridement.

diabetic_foot_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Palliative management of ischaemic foot gangrene
  presenting_complaint: Extensive dry gangrene of the forefoot in a frail patient.
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old female with advanced dementia and T2DM presented with bilateral forefoot gangrene. Following a multidisciplinary review involving the patient's family, it was decided that surgical intervention (amputation) would not be in her best interest due to her frailty. Care focused on pain relief, odour control with charcoal dressings, and preventing secondary infection.

diabetic_foot_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Gas gangrene (Clostridial myonecrosis)
  presenting_complaint: Extreme pain out of proportion to clinical signs, followed by rapid skin darkening.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male with poorly controlled T2DM presented with acute foot pain. Within hours, the skin became bronze and developed haemorrhagic bullae with palpable crepitus. X-ray showed "feathering" gas patterns in the muscles. He underwent an emergency guillotine amputation at the mid-calf level and received high-dose IV penicillin and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

diabetic_foot_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Mixed aetiology (Venous-Diabetic) ulcer
  presenting_complaint: Large, shallow ulcer on the medial malleolus with haemosiderin staining.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old female with T2DM and chronic venous insufficiency presented with a 10cm ulcer. Management was complicated by the need for compression therapy for the venous component, which was contraindicated by her moderate PAD (ABPI 0.6). A modified reduced-compression wrap was used under close vascular supervision, leading to slow but steady improvement.

diabetic_foot_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-surgical wound dehiscence
  presenting_complaint: Opening of the surgical site following a ray amputation.
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male underwent a second ray amputation for osteomyelitis. Two weeks post-operatively, the sutures failed due to poor tissue perfusion and uncontrolled hyperglycaemia. The wound was managed by secondary intention using honey-based dressings and aggressive blood glucose management with an insulin pump, eventually closing after 12 weeks.

diabetic_foot_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Silent MI during diabetic foot sepsis
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath and tachycardia during treatment for a foot abscess.
  summary_of_course: A 71-year-old male was admitted for surgical drainage of a diabetic foot abscess. Post-operatively, he developed asymptomatic tachycardia; ECG showed ST-depression and Troponin T was significantly elevated (1200 ng/L). This "silent" myocardial infarction was attributed to the physiological stress of the foot sepsis and underlying diabetic autonomic neuropathy, requiring urgent cardiology intervention.
