paget_disease_of_bone_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic monostotic Paget disease of bone
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male was found to have an isolated ALP of 420 U/L during a routine health check. Physical examination was unremarkable with no bone pain or deformity. Plain films of the pelvis revealed characteristic trabecular thickening and cortical expansion of the right ilium, confirming monostotic Paget's. Management involved a single infusion of 5mg zoledronic acid, resulting in normalisation of ALP within three months.

paget_disease_of_bone_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Polyostotic Paget disease of bone with tibial bowing
  presenting_complaint: Chronic right shin pain and progressive leg deformity
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female presented with a three-year history of worsening "sabre shin" deformity and local warmth over the right tibia. X-rays showed extensive mixed lytic and sclerotic lesions in the right tibia and left femur. Isotope bone scan confirmed increased uptake in both sites and the skull. She was treated with intravenous bisphosphonates and referred to physiotherapy for gait stabilisation, achieving significant pain reduction.

paget_disease_of_bone_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Paget disease of the skull with cranial nerve involvement
  presenting_complaint: Progressive bilateral hearing loss and increasing hat size
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male reported worsening deafness and frequent headaches. Clinical examination noted a prominent forehead (frontal bossing) and conductive hearing loss on Weber's test. Skull X-ray demonstrated "cotton wool" appearance and thickening of the calvarium. Audiometry confirmed sensorineural and conductive components due to foraminal narrowing; he was started on long-term bisphosphonate therapy to prevent further auditory nerve compression.

paget_disease_of_bone_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Pathological fracture secondary to Paget disease
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset severe thigh pain after a minor trip
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with known but untreated Paget's presented to A&E with an acute mid-shaft femoral fracture following minimal trauma. Radiographs showed a transverse fracture through a region of pagetic bone with marked cortical thickening. She underwent intramedullary nailing and was subsequently started on zoledronic acid post-operatively to stabilise bone turnover. Her recovery was delayed by poor callus formation, a known complication of the disease.

paget_disease_of_bone_005:
  primary_diagnosis: High-output heart failure due to extensive Paget disease
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath and bilateral ankle swelling
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with severe polyostotic Paget's involving over 40% of his skeleton presented with orthopnoea. Echocardiogram revealed high-output cardiac failure, attributed to the massive increase in bone vascularity and arteriovenous shunting within pagetic lesions. ALP was severely elevated at 1800 U/L. Intensive bisphosphonate therapy was initiated alongside diuretics to reduce bone metabolic activity and cardiac demand, leading to gradual symptomatic improvement.

paget_disease_of_bone_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary osteosarcoma arising from Paget disease
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly worsening humerus pain and new soft tissue swelling
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with a 20-year history of stable Paget's disease presented with a sudden change in pain character in his left arm. MRI revealed a destructive mass eroding the cortex of the humerus with an associated soft tissue component. Biopsy confirmed Pagetoid osteosarcoma, a rare but devastating complication. Given his age and comorbidities, he was managed palliatively with local radiotherapy and analgesia.

paget_disease_of_bone_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Spinal Paget disease with nerve root compression
  presenting_complaint: Chronic low back pain and radiating leg weakness
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female presented with neurogenic claudication symptoms. MRI of the lumbar spine showed enlargement of the L4 vertebra (ivory vertebra sign) causing significant central canal stenosis. ALP was moderately raised at 550 U/L. She received intravenous zoledronic acid which stabilised the bone turnover, but persistent neurological deficits eventually required surgical decompression (laminectomy).

paget_disease_of_bone_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Juvenile Paget disease (TNFRSF11B mutation)
  presenting_complaint: Skeletal deformities and multiple fractures in childhood
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy presented with progressive bowing of the long bones and a history of three low-impact fractures. Genetic testing identified a homozygous mutation in the TNFRSF11B gene, confirming the rare juvenile form of the disease. He exhibited massively elevated ALP and generalised osteopenia on DEXA. Treatment with subcutaneous denosumab was initiated in a specialist paediatric metabolic bone unit to control bone resorption.

paget_disease_of_bone_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary osteoarthritis due to Paget disease
  presenting_complaint: Deep groin pain and stiffness in the right hip
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male presented with symptoms suggestive of hip osteoarthritis. Pelvic X-rays showed Pagetoid changes in the acetabulum leading to joint space narrowing and secondary degenerative changes. Despite bisphosphonate treatment for the underlying Paget's, the mechanical joint damage was irreversible. He successfully underwent a total hip replacement, with the surgeon taking extra precautions due to the increased vascularity and hardness of the pagetic bone.

paget_disease_of_bone_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Monostotic Paget disease of the mandible
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty fitting dentures and jaw swelling
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male reported that his lower dentures no longer fit comfortably and noticed a gradual widening of his jawline. Orthopantomogram (OPG) showed a "ground glass" appearance and expansion of the mandible. ALP was only mildly elevated at 180 U/L. He was treated with oral risedronate for six months, which halted the progression of the jaw expansion and allowed for the fitting of new prosthetics.

paget_disease_of_bone_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypercalcaemia of immobilisation in Paget disease
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, constipation, and nausea following bed rest
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old female with extensive polyostotic Paget's was bedbound for two weeks following a chest infection. She developed acute confusion and a corrected calcium of 3.10 mmol/L, despite previously normal levels. The high bone turnover of Paget's was exacerbated by immobilisation, leading to rapid calcium release. She was treated with aggressive IV fluids and a dose of zoledronic acid, which successfully lowered her calcium and ALP levels.

paget_diagnosis_of_bone_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Paget disease of bone with optic nerve compression
  presenting_complaint: Gradual loss of peripheral vision in the left eye
  summary_of_course: A 73-year-old male with known Paget's of the skull presented to ophthalmology with reduced visual acuity. CT imaging of the skull base demonstrated narrowing of the optic canal due to bony overgrowth. Immediate high-dose bisphosphonate therapy was started to reduce bone metabolic activity. While the bone did not regress, the cessation of expansion prevented further visual loss, though his peripheral field deficit remained permanent.

paget_disease_of_bone_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Paget disease of bone (Diagnostic Challenge)
  presenting_complaint: Lower back pain and suspected metastatic prostate cancer
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male with a PSA of 8.0 ng/ml and sclerotic lesions on a lumbar spine X-ray was initially suspected of having metastatic prostate cancer. However, a bone scan showed uptake patterns more characteristic of Paget's (involving the entire vertebral body), and his ALP was disproportionately high (900 U/L) compared to his PSA. A bone biopsy confirmed disorganized lamellar bone and "mosaic" patterns, ruling out malignancy and confirming Paget's disease.

paget_disease_of_bone_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Relapsed Paget disease of bone
  presenting_complaint: Recurrence of dull aching pain in the right femur
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old female, previously treated with oral etidronate ten years ago, presented with a return of her symptoms. Her ALP, which had been stable at 110 U/L, had risen to 380 U/L. Repeat imaging showed active lytic progression at the distal end of her previous femoral lesion. She was switched to a more potent bisphosphonate (IV zoledronic acid), which achieved biochemical remission and symptom control.

paget_disease_of_bone_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Paget disease of bone with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
  presenting_complaint: Pelvic pain in a patient with Stage 4 CKD
  summary_of_course: An 81-year-old female with an eGFR of 22 ml/min/1.73m² presented with symptomatic Paget's of the pelvis. Standard IV zoledronic acid was contraindicated due to her renal impairment. After specialist multidisciplinary discussion, she was treated with a very cautious course of low-dose oral risedronate with frequent monitoring of renal function and calcium levels. Her pain improved and her ALP dropped from 600 U/L to 250 U/L without worsening her CKD.

paget_disease_of_bone_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute gout secondary to Paget disease
  presenting_complaint: Acute, red, swollen first metatarsophalangeal joint
  summary_of_course: A 71-year-old male with active polyostotic Paget's presented with an acute flare of gout. Blood tests showed hyperuricaemia (urate 580 µmol/L) and an ALP of 750 U/L. The high nucleic acid turnover associated with rapid bone cell proliferation in Paget's was identified as the secondary cause of his gout. He was treated with colchicine for the acute flare and subsequently started on allopurinol and zoledronic acid to manage both conditions.

paget_disease_of_bone_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Paget disease with fissure fractures (Looser's zones)
  presenting_complaint: Localised "stinging" pain in the lateral thigh
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male with femoral Paget's reported sharp pain when weight-bearing. X-rays revealed multiple small, horizontal radiolucent lines on the convex surface of the femoral cortex, consistent with incomplete "fissure" fractures. He was advised to use crutches to reduce weight-bearing and treated with zoledronic acid. Follow-up X-rays at six months showed healing of the fissures and no progression to a complete pathological fracture.

paget_disease_of_bone_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Monostotic Paget disease of the humerus
  presenting_complaint: Persistent dull ache in the upper arm
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female presented with a six-month history of a non-specific ache in her left shoulder and arm. Initial suspicion of rotator cuff tendinopathy was revised when an X-ray showed cortical thickening and a "blade of grass" lytic lesion in the proximal humerus. ALP was only 150 U/L (upper limit of normal). A diagnosis of early-stage monostotic Paget's was made, and she was treated with oral bisphosphonates with complete resolution of pain.

paget_disease_of_bone_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Paget disease of the thoracic spine
  presenting_complaint: Mid-back pain and progressive kyphosis
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old female presented with an increasing "hump" in her upper back and chronic pain. Imaging showed Pagetoid involvement of T6-T8 with vertebral body enlargement and mild anterior wedging. There were no signs of cord compression on MRI. She was managed conservatively with analgesia, a supportive brace, and bisphosphonates to prevent further vertebral expansion and deformity.

paget_disease_of_bone_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe polyostotic Paget disease with multi-system involvement
  presenting_complaint: Generalised bone pain, fatigue, and hearing loss
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old male presented with extensive involvement of the skull, pelvis, spine, and both femora. His ALP was profoundly elevated at 2200 U/L. He suffered from multiple complications including deafness, secondary hip arthritis, and mild congestive heart failure. A multi-disciplinary approach was required, involving rheumatology, audiology, and cardiology, with intravenous zoledronic acid forming the cornerstone of his metabolic management.
