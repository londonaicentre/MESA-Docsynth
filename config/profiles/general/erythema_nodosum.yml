  presenting_complaint: Slowly expanding, less painful red patches on one leg.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female presented with a 6-month history of migrating, erythematous plaques on her left lateral calf. Unlike classic EN, these were less tender and showed peripheral expansion. Skin biopsy confirmed septal panniculitis, and she was diagnosed with erythema nodosum migrans (Subacute Nodular Hypodermitis), which eventually responded to a course of potassium iodide.

erythema_nodosum_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Erythema Nodosum in Ulcerative Colitis
  presenting_complaint: Extensive painful nodules and severe abdominal cramping.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male with poorly controlled ulcerative colitis was admitted with severe, necrotic-appearing erythema nodosum and a major bowel flare. He was systemicially unwell with a microcytic anaemia and hypoalbuminaemia. Intravenous hydrocortisone was administered for the colitis, which simultaneously led to the rapid involution of the leg nodules.
