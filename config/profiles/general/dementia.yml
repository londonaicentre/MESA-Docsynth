  summary_of_course: 77-year-old male with established Parkinson's disease developed worsening attention, executive function, and visual hallucinations. Cognitive symptoms appeared significantly later than motor symptoms, distinguishing it from DLB. Rivastigmine patches were prescribed which improved his cognitive fluctuations without worsening his tremor.

  primary_diagnosis: Normal pressure hydrocephalus
  presenting_complaint: Gait instability, urinary urgency, and cognitive decline
  summary_of_course: 70-year-old male presented with the classic triad of gait, bladder, and cognitive symptoms over 6 months. A large-volume lumbar puncture resulted in a transient improvement in walking speed. He underwent a ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion resulting in significant resolution of his gait and cognitive symptoms.

dementia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcohol-related dementia
  presenting_complaint: Persistent memory deficits and confabulation
  summary_of_course: 52-year-old male with a 20-year history of heavy alcohol use presented following an admission for Wernicke's encephalopathy. Despite 6 months of abstinence and high-dose thiamine, significant deficits in new learning and executive function persisted. Neuropsychological testing confirmed a diagnosis of alcohol-related brain damage.

  presenting_complaint: Loss of word meaning and difficulty identifying familiar objects
  summary_of_course: 60-year-old female presented with empty speech and inability to name common objects like a kettle. MRI brain demonstrated asymmetric focal atrophy of the left anterior temporal lobe.
