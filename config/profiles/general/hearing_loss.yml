hearing_loss_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Age-related sensorineural hearing loss (Presbycusis)
  presenting_complaint: Gradual bilateral hearing decline and social withdrawal
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male presented with a 5-year history of progressive bilateral hearing loss, particularly struggling with speech clarity in noisy environments. Pure tone audiometry (PTA) confirmed a symmetrical down-sloping sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) consistent with presbycusis. He was fitted with bilateral behind-the-ear digital hearing aids in the audiology outpatient clinic, resulting in significant improvement in his Social Hearing Index score.

hearing_loss_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset unilateral deafness and "fullness" in the right ear
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented to A&E with a 4-hour history of sudden, profound hearing loss in the right ear accompanied by high-pitched tinnitus. Urgent PTA showed a 65dB loss across three contiguous frequencies with no conductive component. She was commenced on a high-dose tapering course of oral prednisolone and referred for urgent intratympanic steroid injections, achieving partial recovery of hearing thresholds at 2 weeks.

hearing_loss_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Otitis media with effusion (Glue ear)
  presenting_complaint: Reduced hearing and delayed speech development
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old boy was referred by his GP due to parental concerns regarding hearing and "selective listening" over 6 months. Examination revealed dull, retracted tympanic membranes bilaterally, and tympanometry showed Type B (flat) curves. Following a 3-month period of watchful waiting without resolution, he underwent bilateral myringotomy and grommet insertion, leading to immediate restoration of normal hearing levels.

hearing_loss_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Otosclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Progressive bilateral hearing loss, worse on the left
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old female presented with a 3-year history of slowly worsening hearing loss and paracusis Willisii (hearing better in noisy environments). PTA demonstrated a bilateral conductive hearing loss with a characteristic "Carhart's notch" at 2kHz on the left. Following a multidisciplinary discussion, she elected for a left laser stapedotomy, which successfully closed the air-bone gap and improved her quality of life.

hearing_loss_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-meningitic profound hearing loss
  presenting_complaint: Total loss of hearing following discharge from ICU
  summary_of_course: A 2-year-old girl developed profound bilateral SNHL as a complication of Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis. Initial ABR (Auditory Brainstem Response) testing showed no waveforms at 90dB nHL bilaterally. Urgent MRI internal auditory meatus (IAM) was performed to assess cochlear patency due to the high risk of labyrinthitis ossificans, and she was fast-tracked for bilateral cochlear implantation.

hearing_loss_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Vestibular Schwannoma (Acoustic Neuroma)
  presenting_complaint: Unilateral hearing loss and mild imbalance
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old male reported a 12-month history of progressive left-sided hearing loss and occasional light-headedness. PTA confirmed asymmetrical SNHL, and subsequent MRI of the IAMs identified a 1.5cm enhancing mass in the left cerebellopontine angle. Given the size and symptoms, he was managed via a "wait and scan" surveillance programme with annual imaging and audiological monitoring.

hearing_loss_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Meniere's disease
  presenting_complaint: Episodic vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, and roaring tinnitus
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old woman presented with recurrent 2-hour episodes of rotatory vertigo associated with a "blocked" feeling in her right ear. Serial audiograms documented a fluctuating low-frequency SNHL in the right ear during symptomatic periods. She was started on a low-salt diet and betahistine, with intratympanic gentamicin considered as a second-line option for refractory vertigo.

hearing_loss_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL)
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty hearing in crowds and persistent tinnitus
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old former factory worker presented with chronic bilateral hearing loss and high-frequency tinnitus. PTA revealed a characteristic symmetrical SNHL with a "noise notch" at 4kHz, typical of long-term occupational noise exposure. He was counselled on noise protection for his hobby of clay pigeon shooting and provided with bilateral hearing aids to improve speech perception.

hearing_loss_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Gentamicin-induced ototoxicity
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly worsening hearing and oscillopsia whilst on antibiotics
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with complex urosepsis and pre-existing chronic kidney disease (Stage 4) received a prolonged course of IV gentamicin. Despite serum level monitoring, he developed acute bilateral SNHL and significant vestibular dysfunction (oscillopsia). Gentamicin was immediately ceased, but the hearing loss remained permanent, requiring long-term vestibular rehabilitation and high-power hearing aids.

hearing_loss_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Cholesteatoma
  presenting_complaint: Foul-smelling ear discharge and progressive hearing loss
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old male presented with chronic, malodorous left-sided otorrhoea and worsening hearing over 2 years. Otoscopy revealed an attic retraction pocket containing keratin debris, and CT imaging showed erosion of the ossicular chain. He underwent a modified radical mastoidectomy and ossiculoplasty, which successfully eradicated the disease and stabilised his conductive hearing thresholds.

hearing_loss_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Impacted cerumen
  presenting_complaint: Sudden "muffled" hearing after swimming
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female reported sudden-onset unilateral hearing loss after a holiday. Examination revealed a dense plug of impacted cerumen occluding the entire external auditory canal. Following a week of olive oil drops, the wax was removed via microsuction in the community clinic, resulting in the immediate resolution of her symptoms and a normal follow-up audiogram.

hearing_loss_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Barotrauma with perilymph fistula
  presenting_complaint: Sudden hearing loss and vertigo after scuba diving
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male experienced sharp ear pain and sudden deafness in his right ear during a rapid ascent while diving. He also reported vertigo exacerbated by coughing (positive Hennebert's sign). He was admitted for bed rest with head elevation and avoidance of straining; when symptoms failed to improve after 48 hours, middle ear exploration was performed to repair a suspected perilymph fistula at the round window.

hearing_loss_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Congenital Cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection
  presenting_complaint: Failed newborn hearing screening
  summary_of_course: A neonate failed her automated otoacoustic emissions (AOAE) and ABR screening bilaterally. Saliva PCR confirmed congenital CMV infection within the first 21 days of life. She was commenced on a 6-month course of oral valganciclovir to prevent further hearing deterioration and was enrolled in a paediatric audiology monitoring programme for progressive SNHL.

hearing_loss_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Longitudinal temporal bone fracture
  presenting_complaint: Hearing loss and bleeding from the ear following a fall
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male was admitted to the trauma unit following a high-velocity road traffic accident. Examination showed a haemotympanum and "Battle's sign" behind the left ear, while CT head confirmed a longitudinal fracture of the temporal bone. Audiometry later revealed a 40dB conductive hearing loss due to incudostapedial joint disarticulation, which was managed conservatively for 3 months before considering surgical reconstruction.

hearing_loss_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED)
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive bilateral hearing loss over 3 weeks
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female with known systemic lupus erythematosus presented with hearing loss that worsened significantly over several weeks. PTA showed bilateral asymmetrical SNHL that responded dramatically to a trial of high-dose oral steroids. She was subsequently transitioned to methotrexate as a steroid-sparing agent by the rheumatology team to maintain her hearing thresholds.

hearing_loss_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Waardenburg Syndrome (Type 1)
  presenting_complaint: Profound congenital hearing loss and heterochromia iridis
  summary_of_course: A 6-month-old infant was referred following a diagnosis of profound bilateral SNHL on ABR. Clinical examination noted a wide nasal bridge (dystopia canthorum), a white forelock of hair, and different coloured eyes (heterochromia). Genetic testing confirmed a mutation in the PAX3 gene, and the child was successfully managed with early bilateral cochlear implantation and speech and language therapy.

hearing_loss_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Herpes Zoster Oticus (Ramsay Hunt Syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Ear pain, facial weakness, and hearing loss
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male presented with severe right-sided otalgia followed by a vesicular rash in the concha and a Grade IV House-Brackmann facial nerve palsy. Audiometry confirmed a concurrent moderate SNHL on the affected side. He was treated with aciclovir and prednisolone; while the facial palsy improved, he was left with a permanent mild-to-moderate high-frequency hearing deficit.

hearing_loss_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Auditory Neuropathy Spectrum Disorder (ANSD)
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty understanding speech despite "normal" hearing on some tests
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old girl with a history of neonatal jaundice was referred due to significant difficulties with speech perception in school. Testing showed preserved OAEs but absent or severely disordered ABR waveforms, pathognomonic for ANSD. She was managed with a personal FM system (remote microphone technology) in the classroom to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.

hearing_loss_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Cogan's Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Red eyes, vertigo, and rapidly declining hearing
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old male presented with interstitial keratitis (documented by ophthalmology) and sudden onset vestibulo-auditory symptoms. He developed profound bilateral SNHL within 2 months, alongside systemic vasculitis symptoms. Despite aggressive immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide and steroids, his hearing did not recover, necessitating bilateral cochlear implants.

hearing_loss_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute mastoiditis with intracranial complication
  presenting_complaint: Severe ear pain, hearing loss, and headache
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy presented with a 1-week history of acute otitis media, now progressing to retroauricular swelling and a protruding pinna. He was febrile and lethargic, with CT showing mastoid opacification and a small sigmoid sinus thrombosis. He underwent emergency cortical mastoidectomy and received 4 weeks of IV antibiotics, resulting in resolution of the infection, though he retained a persistent moderate conductive hearing loss.
