  primary_diagnosis: Acute paracetamol poisoning
  presenting_complaint: Intentional overdose of 20g paracetamol 4 hours ago.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female presented to A&E after ingesting forty 500mg tablets following a relationship breakdown. Initial paracetamol level was 180 mg/L, falling above the treatment line on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram. Intravenous N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was administered via the SNAP protocol, and the patient was discharged after 24 hours with normal liver function tests and psychiatric follow-up.

  primary_diagnosis: Staggered paracetamol overdose
  presenting_complaint: Nausea and right upper quadrant pain.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with chronic back pain inadvertently took 10g of paracetamol daily for three days. On admission, ALT was 450 U/L and paracetamol levels were detectable but low. He received a full course of IV NAC; his transaminases peaked at 800 U/L before resolving, and he was counselled on safe analgesic use.

  presenting_complaint: Ingestion of unknown quantity of liquid paracetamol.
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old boy was brought to A&E after being found with an open bottle of Calpol. A 4-hour paracetamol level was 45 mg/L, well below the treatment threshold for his weight.

acute_toxicity_from_paracetamol_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic paracetamol toxicity in a high-risk patient
  presenting_complaint: Generalised malaise and tea-coloured urine.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with chronic alcohol dependency took 6g of paracetamol daily for a week for toothache. Despite the "therapeutic" dose, his glutathione stores were depleted, leading to an ALT of 1200 U/L and mild coagulopathy. He required prolonged NAC infusion and nutritional support.

acute_toxicity_from_paracetamol_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute paracetamol toxicity with anaphylactoid reaction to NAC
  presenting_complaint: Vomiting and epigastric pain after 15g ingestion.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female developed a widespread urticarial rash and wheeze shortly after starting the first NAC infusion.

  primary_diagnosis: Severe paracetamol toxicity with Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)
  presenting_complaint: Anuria and persistent vomiting.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male presented 36 hours post-ingestion of 30g paracetamol. In addition to severe hepatotoxicity (ALT 4000 U/L), he developed Stage 3 AKI with a creatinine of 450 µmol/L. He required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) alongside NAC and eventually regained renal function over two weeks.

acute_toxicity_from_paracetamol_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute paracetamol toxicity in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Intentional ingestion of 12g paracetamol at 26 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old pregnant female presented 6 hours post-ingestion. NAC was initiated immediately to protect both maternal and foetal liver function. Obstetric review confirmed normal foetal heart rate and movements, and she completed the protocol with no adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes.

acute_toxicity_from_paracetamol_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Mixed overdose (Paracetamol and Propranolol)
  presenting_complaint: Bradycardia, hypotension, and lethargy.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male ingested 20g paracetamol and 1.6g propranolol. Treatment involved glucagon and vasopressors for the beta-blocker toxicity alongside standard NAC for the paracetamol. The patient required ICU admission for cardiovascular support but survived with normal organ function.

acute_toxicity_from_paracetamol_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Paracetamol toxicity with diagnostic delay
  presenting_complaint: Non-specific abdominal pain and vomiting.
  summary_of_course: A 17-year-old initially denied overdose but presented 24 hours later with jaundice. Bloods revealed an ALT of 3200 U/L and paracetamol level of 20 mg/L. Despite late administration of NAC, the patient progressed to liver failure and required King's College Criteria assessment for transplantation.

acute_toxicity_from_paracetamol_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Massive paracetamol ingestion with early metabolic acidosis
  presenting_complaint: Comatose state 2 hours post-ingestion.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male ingested an estimated 75g of paracetamol. He presented with a profound metabolic acidosis (pH 7.0, lactate 12 mmol/L) before any rise in transaminases occurred. Early haemodialysis was initiated to remove paracetamol and correct acidosis, alongside high-dose NAC.

acute_toxicity_from_paracetamol_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic paracetamol toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Worsening RUQ pain and nausea.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis on regular paracetamol (4g/day) took an additional 10g in a moment of distress. Her baseline induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes increased her risk. NAC was started based on the cumulative dose and elevated ALT, preventing progression to liver failure.

acute_toxicity_from_paracetamol_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Paracetamol toxicity in a malnourished patient
  presenting_complaint: Weakness and mild jaundice.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old with anorexia nervosa (BMI 14.5) ingested 8g of paracetamol. Due to suspected low glutathione stores, she was treated with NAC despite her paracetamol level being slightly below the standard treatment line. She developed mild transaminitis which resolved with 24 hours of IV fluids and NAC.

acute_toxicity_from_paracetamol_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute paracetamol toxicity (unintentional)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent nausea and anorexia over 48 hours.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female confused her medications and took 8g of paracetamol daily for 4 days. She presented with an INR of 1.8 and ALT of 600 U/L. She was treated with a modified NAC protocol for 48 hours until her INR dropped below 1.3 and ALT began to decline.

acute_toxicity_from_paracetamol_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Paracetamol toxicity with Co-codamol ingestion
  presenting_complaint: Drowsiness and pinpoint pupils.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female overdosed on thirty 30/500mg Co-codamol tablets. She required naloxone to reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression and NAC for the paracetamol component. Her paracetamol level was 130 mg/L at 4 hours, necessitating the full NAC protocol.

acute_toxicity_from_paracetamol_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Paracetamol toxicity in a patient on enzyme-inducing drugs
  presenting_complaint: Intentional ingestion of 10g paracetamol.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male with epilepsy on carbamazepine presented 5 hours post-ingestion. Because carbamazepine induces CYP2E1, increasing toxic metabolite production, he was treated at a lower threshold (75 mg/L line). He completed NAC without developing significant hepatotoxicity.

acute_toxicity_from_paracetamol_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Late-presenting paracetamol toxicity (72 hours)
  presenting_complaint: Profound jaundice and haematemesis.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male presented 3 days after an overdose with multi-organ failure. Labs showed ALT 8000 U/L, INR 6.5, and creatinine 380 µmol/L. Despite maximal medical therapy in ICU, he developed cerebral oedema and passed away before a donor organ became available.

acute_toxicity_from_paracetamol_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Paracetamol toxicity with secondary infection
  presenting_complaint: Fever and RUQ pain following paracetamol overdose.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old female recovering from paracetamol-induced liver injury (ALT peaked at 2500 U/L) developed a secondary bacterial peritonitis. She required intravenous antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam) in addition to NAC. Her liver function eventually recovered, but her hospital stay was prolonged by 10 days.

acute_toxicity_from_paracetamol_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Low-risk paracetamol ingestion
  presenting_complaint: Ingestion of 5g paracetamol 8 hours ago.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male ingested ten 500mg tablets. His 8-hour paracetamol level was 15 mg/L, which is well below the treatment line. He was discharged from the emergency department with a mental health referral and no medical intervention required.

acute_toxicity_from_paracetamol_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Paracetamol toxicity with treatment failure/resistance
  presenting_complaint: Rising ALT despite early NAC administration.
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old male presented 3 hours after ingesting 40g of paracetamol. NAC was started at 4 hours, but his ALT continued to rise, reaching 3000 U/L by day 3. The NAC infusion was continued beyond the standard protocol until his ALT and INR showed a clear downward trend over five days.
