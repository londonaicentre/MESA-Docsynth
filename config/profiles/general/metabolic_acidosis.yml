  primary_diagnosis: Metformin-Associated Lactic Acidosis (MALA)
  presenting_complaint: Severe malaise and diarrhoea.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male on Metformin for Type 2 Diabetes developed acute gastroenteritis leading to AKI. On admission, his pH was 7.01, lactate 16 mmol/L, and creatinine 640 µmol/L. Due to the severity of the lactic acidosis and Metformin accumulation, he underwent continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVH) in the ICU.

Post-operatively, she developed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (pH 7.22, HCO3 12 mmol/L) despite a relatively normal blood glucose of 7.8 mmol/L. The diagnosis of euglycaemic DKA was confirmed by high serum ketones (4.8 mmol/L), and she was treated with intravenous glucose and insulin.

  presenting_complaint: Generalized muscle weakness and polyuria.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female with Sjögren's syndrome presented with profound hypokalaemia (K+ 2.2 mmol/L) and a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis.

ABG showed a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis (pH 7.31, Na 138, Cl 114, HCO3 15) due to gastrointestinal bicarbonate loss. Symptoms and biochemistry improved rapidly with intravenous Hartmann’s solution rehydration.

metabolic_acidosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Mesenteric Ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset, "pain out of proportion to clinical signs".
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with atrial fibrillation presented with excruciating abdominal pain. Initial lactate was 11.5 mmol/L with a pH of 7.15, raising suspicion of bowel infarction. CT angiography confirmed a superior mesenteric artery embolus, and he was taken for emergency laparotomy, which revealed extensive small bowel necrosis.

  primary_diagnosis: 5-Oxoprolinuria (Pyroglutamic Acidosis)
  presenting_complaint: Unexplained high anion gap acidosis.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old malnourished female taking regular maximum-dose Paracetamol for osteoarthritis presented with a pH of 7.24 and an anion gap of 24 mmol/L. Sepsis and ketoacidosis were ruled out; urine organic acid analysis revealed high levels of 5-oxoproline. The condition resolved after stopping Paracetamol and providing nutritional support with N-acetylcysteine.

  presenting_complaint: Lethargy and chronic bone pain.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male who underwent a ureterosigmoidostomy for bladder cancer 20 years ago presented with a persistent hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis (Cl 118 mmol/L, HCO3 17 mmol/L). This was caused by the colon's reabsorption of urinary chloride in exchange for bicarbonate. He was managed with regular oral bicarbonate and advised on frequent rectal emptying.

metabolic_acidosis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Methanol Toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Blurred vision described as a "snowstorm".
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male was brought to the ED after consuming bootleg spirits. He presented with an ABG pH of 7.08, an anion gap of 29 mmol/L, and optic disc oedema on fundoscopy. He was treated with an ethanol infusion (as fomepizole was unavailable) and urgent haemodialysis to prevent permanent blindness and neurological damage.

  presenting_complaint: Routine bloods showing high potassium.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male with diabetic nephropathy was prescribed Ramipril and Spironolactone for heart failure. He presented with asymptomatic hyperkalaemia (K+ 6.3 mmol/L) and a mild normal anion gap metabolic acidosis (pH 7.33, HCO3 19 mmol/L). The Type 4 RTA was managed by stopping the Spironolactone and initiating a low-potassium diet.

  primary_diagnosis: D-Lactic Acidosis
  presenting_complaint: Episodes of ataxia, slurred speech, and confusion.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female with Short Bowel Syndrome presented with "drunken" behaviour after a high-carbohydrate meal. Standard lactate (L-lactate) was normal, but blood gas showed a high anion gap acidosis (pH 7.29). Specific testing for D-lactate was positive, confirming bacterial overgrowth in the residual colon; she was treated with oral antibiotics and dietary modification.

metabolic_acidosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Cyanide Toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Coma and profound lactic acidosis after a house fire.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female was rescued from a burning building with significant smoke inhalation. She was found to have a pH of 7.05 and a lactate of 15 mmol/L that was refractory to fluid resuscitation. Given the clinical context and severity of the lactic acidosis, she was treated empirically with intravenous hydroxocobalamin, leading to rapid clinical improvement.

  presenting_complaint: Post-operative monitoring.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male victim of major trauma received 8 litres of 0.9% Normal Saline during initial resuscitation. Post-operative ABG showed a pH of 7.26 and a chloride of 116 mmol/L with a normal anion gap. The acidosis was recognized as iatrogenic hyperchloraemia and resolved over the following 24 hours after switching maintenance fluids to Plasmalyte-148.

  primary_diagnosis: Propofol Infusion Syndrome (PRIS)
  presenting_complaint: Bradycardia and rising lactate in ICU.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male with a traumatic brain injury was receiving high-dose Propofol sedation for 72 hours. He developed sudden-onset refractory metabolic acidosis (pH 7.18), rhabdomyolysis, and cardiac instability. Propofol was immediately discontinued and replaced with Midazolam; he required temporary renal replacement therapy for the associated hyperkalaemia and metabolic derangement.
