  presenting_complaint: Persistent dry cough, night sweats, and 6kg weight loss over two months.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male from an endemic region presented with drenching night sweats and significant weight loss. Chest radiograph (CXR) revealed a classic fine 1-2mm micronodular pattern "millet seed" distribution throughout both lung fields. Sputum cultures confirmed Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and he was commenced on standard quadruple therapy (RIPE), showing good clinical improvement at 6-month follow-up.

miliary_tuberculosis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric miliary tuberculosis with meningitis
  presenting_complaint: Irritability, vomiting, and high-grade pyrexia in a toddler.
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old female presented with a one-week history of lethargy and meningism. CT brain showed basal meningeal enhancement, while CXR demonstrated diffuse miliary shadowing. CSF PCR was positive for TB; she was treated with dexamethasone and intensive anti-tuberculous therapy in a paediatric high dependency unit with gradual recovery.

miliary_tuberculosis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Cryptic miliary tuberculosis
  presenting_complaint: Generalised malaise, anorexia, and unexplained anaemia in an elderly patient.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with multiple comorbidities presented with "failure to thrive" and a normocytic anaemia. Initial CXR was inconclusive, but HRCT thorax revealed occult miliary nodules. Bone marrow biopsy confirmed non-caseating granulomas and acid-fast bacilli (AFB), leading to a diagnosis of cryptic miliary TB, which was treated with dose-adjusted Rifater.

miliary_tuberculosis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute miliary tuberculosis with ARDS
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset severe breathlessness and hypoxic respiratory failure.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented acutely with a respiratory rate of 35 and oxygen saturations of 82% on room air. She rapidly deteriorated, requiring intubation and ICU admission; HRCT showed confluent miliary nodules and ground-glass opacities consistent with ARDS. Despite aggressive ventilation and intravenous anti-TB medication, she remained critically ill for three weeks before slow stabilization.

miliary_tuberculosis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Disseminated miliary tuberculosis in HIV/AIDS
  presenting_complaint: Fever of unknown origin, abdominal pain, and lymphadenopathy.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male with a new diagnosis of HIV (CD4 count 45 cells/uL) presented with profound cachexia and hepatosplenomegaly. Imaging showed miliary lung nodules, abdominal lymphadenopathy, and splenic micro-abscesses. Blood cultures (BACTEC) grew M. tuberculosis, and he was managed for disseminated disease with careful monitoring for Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS).

miliary_tuberculosis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-transplant miliary tuberculosis
  presenting_complaint: Low-grade fever and dry cough three months after renal transplantation.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male on tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil presented with persistent pyrexia. HRCT chest showed a miliary pattern, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was positive for TB. Immunosuppression was reduced, and anti-TB therapy was initiated, requiring complex monitoring of drug-drug interactions between rifampicin and his transplant medications.

miliary_tuberculosis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Miliary tuberculosis with hepatic involvement
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice, right upper quadrant pain, and rigors.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male presented with obstructive-pattern deranged LFTs (ALP 600 U/L, Bilirubin 45 umol/L) and hepatomegaly. While abdominal ultrasound was non-specific, CXR showed miliary mottling. Liver biopsy revealed multiple granulomas with central caseation, and he was successfully treated with a modified TB regimen to account for baseline hepatotoxicity.

miliary_tuberculosis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Miliary tuberculosis with choroidal tubercles
  presenting_complaint: Blurred vision and persistent headache.
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old female undergoing investigation for pyrexia of unknown origin underwent fundoscopy, which revealed pathognomonic yellowish-white choroidal tubercles. Subsequent CT chest confirmed miliary spread despite a previously clear CXR. This ocular finding was the key diagnostic clue that led to early initiation of treatment and prevention of further CNS deterioration.

miliary_tuberculosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Miliary tuberculosis with Pott’s disease
  presenting_complaint: Chronic mid-back pain and progressive lower limb weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male presented with T8-T9 spinal tenderness and night sweats. MRI spine showed discitis and paravertebral abscesses, while staging CXR revealed incidental widespread miliary nodules. He underwent surgical decompression and stabilization followed by 12 months of anti-TB therapy for disseminated osteoarticular and miliary disease.

miliary_tuberculosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Multi-drug resistant (MDR) miliary tuberculosis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent fever and worsening cough despite two months of standard TB treatment.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male initially diagnosed with miliary TB failed to improve on RIPE therapy. Sputum GeneXpert and subsequent sensitivities confirmed resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid. His regimen was switched to a second-line MDR protocol including bedaquiline and linezolid, resulting in eventual culture conversion after four months.

miliary_tuberculosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Miliary tuberculosis presenting as HLH
  presenting_complaint: High fever, pancytopenia, and multi-organ dysfunction.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male presented with features of Haemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), including hyperferritinaemia and splenomegaly. Bone marrow aspirate showed haemophagocytosis and AFB, while imaging confirmed miliary pulmonary spread. He required intensive support and corticosteroids alongside anti-TB treatment to manage the life-threatening hyperinflammatory response.

  primary_diagnosis: Miliary tuberculosis with adrenal insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Extreme fatigue, skin hyperpigmentation, and postural hypotension.
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old female presented with Addisonian features and hyponatraemia. CT abdomen showed bilateral adrenal enlargement with calcification, and CXR showed a subtle miliary pattern. A short Synacthen test confirmed adrenal insufficiency secondary to TB, requiring lifelong steroid replacement in addition to her curative anti-TB course.

miliary_tuberculosis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic miliary tuberculosis
  presenting_complaint: Long-standing productive cough with sudden onset haemoptysis.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with a history of untreated "smoker's cough" presented with a large volume haemoptysis. Imaging revealed chronic cavitary TB in the upper lobes with a new, acute miliary dissemination throughout the remaining lung parenchyma. He was admitted for bronchial artery embolisation and urgent initiation of anti-TB chemotherapy.

miliary_tuberculosis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Miliary tuberculosis with pericardial effusion
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath, chest heaviness, and muffled heart sounds.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female presented with signs of cardiac tamponade. Echocardiography confirmed a large pericardial effusion, and pericardiocentesis yielded straw-coloured fluid with high adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels. CXR showed miliary nodules, confirming disseminated TB; she was treated with RIPE and a tapering course of prednisolone to prevent constrictive pericarditis.

miliary_tuberculosis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Genitourinary and miliary tuberculosis
  presenting_complaint: Sterile pyuria, frequency, and dull loin pain.
  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old male was investigated for persistent leucocytes in urine with negative standard cultures. Renal tract imaging showed papillary necrosis, and staging HRCT revealed asymptomatic miliary lung nodules. Early morning urine samples were positive for M. tuberculosis on liquid culture, confirming disseminated genitourinary and miliary disease.

  primary_diagnosis: Miliary tuberculosis with Tuberculous Cutis Miliaris Disseminata
  presenting_complaint: Widespread papular skin rash and high fever in an infant.
  summary_of_course: An 8-month-old infant presented with a dusky red, maculopapular eruption and respiratory distress. Skin biopsy showed AFB and granulomas, and CXR confirmed miliary lung involvement. The patient was treated in a specialist paediatric infectious disease unit with quadruple therapy and nutritional support, leading to resolution of the rash and lung nodules.

miliary_tuberculosis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Miliary tuberculosis with pancytopenia
  presenting_complaint: Severe bruising, epistaxis, and profound lethargy.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male presented with petechiae and a haemoglobin of 6.2 g/dL, white cell count of 1.5 x 10^9/L, and platelets of 20 x 10^9/L. Bone marrow trephine revealed extensive granulomatous infiltration and necrosis. HRCT chest confirmed miliary TB as the underlying cause of his bone marrow failure, which responded well to anti-TB therapy and blood product support.

miliary_tuberculosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Occupational miliary tuberculosis
  presenting_complaint: New onset cough and night sweats in a healthcare professional.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old nurse who had worked on a TB ward presented with a three-week history of constitutional symptoms. Despite a previous negative IGRA, she now had a positive T-SPOT and a CXR showing classic miliary spread. She was managed as an outpatient through the occupational health and respiratory TB services with full recovery.

miliary_tuberculosis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Miliary tuberculosis with IRIS
  presenting_complaint: Worsening respiratory symptoms and new lymphadenopathy after starting HIV treatment.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male with HIV/TB co-infection initially improved on anti-TB drugs but developed high fevers and enlarging neck nodes two weeks after starting antiretroviral therapy (ART). Repeat imaging showed "paradoxical" worsening of miliary infiltrates. This was diagnosed as Paradoxical IRIS; he continued TB treatment and ART with the addition of temporary corticosteroids to manage the inflammatory surge.

miliary_tuberculosis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Miliary tuberculosis with multiple tuberculomas
  presenting_complaint: New onset tonic-clonic seizure and confusion.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female presented following a first-time seizure. MRI brain showed multiple "ring-enhancing" lesions (tuberculomas) throughout both hemispheres, and CXR showed miliary nodules. She was treated with anti-epileptics, high-dose steroids, and a prolonged 12-month course of anti-TB therapy, resulting in gradual radiological resolution of the intracranial lesions.
