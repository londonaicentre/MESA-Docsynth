acute_hepatitis_e_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis E (Genotype 3)
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice, dark urine, and lethargy
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male presented with a 10-day history of progressive jaundice and malaise following consumption of undercooked pork sausages. Investigations revealed an ALT of 1450 U/L and Bilirubin of 110 µmol/L, with positive HEV IgM and HEV RNA (Genotype 3). The patient was managed supportively in the community with regular LFT monitoring, showing complete biochemical resolution within eight weeks.

acute_hepatitis_e_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Fulminant Acute Hepatitis E in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Severe jaundice, vomiting, and altered consciousness
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old female, 32 weeks pregnant, recently returned from South Asia, presented with rapid-onset hepatic encephalopathy. Laboratory tests showed an INR of 3.2, ALT of 2800 U/L, and positive HEV IgM (Genotype 1). Despite emergency Caesarean section and intensive care support for acute liver failure, the clinical course was complicated by coagulopathy, though she eventually recovered following prolonged tertiary care.

acute_hepatitis_e_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Hepatitis E in Immunocompromised Host
  presenting_complaint: Persistently deranged liver function tests
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male renal transplant recipient on tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil demonstrated fluctuating ALT levels (150-300 U/L) over six months. Molecular testing confirmed persistent HEV RNA detection, diagnostic of chronic hepatitis E. Treatment with a three-month course of Ribavirin was initiated, resulting in viral clearance and normalisation of transaminases.

acute_hepatitis_e_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis E with Neuralgic Amyotrophy
  presenting_complaint: Severe right shoulder pain followed by weakness and mild jaundice
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old male presented with acute brachial plexus neuropathy and concurrent mild scleral icterus. Investigations showed an ALT of 420 U/L and positive serum HEV IgM. This extrahepatic neurological manifestation of acute HEV was managed with analgesia and physiotherapy, with the hepatitis resolving spontaneously while neurological recovery was partial at six months.

acute_hepatitis_e_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) triggered by HEV
  presenting_complaint: Worsening ascites and new-onset jaundice
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with known alcoholic cirrhosis presented with sudden clinical decompensation. Serology confirmed acute HEV infection as the precipitant for ACLF, with a MELD score of 28. He required hospitalisation for management of Grade 2 encephalopathy and diuretics for ascites, eventually stabilising after three weeks of inpatient care.

acute_hepatitis_e_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Acute Hepatitis E
  presenting_complaint: Nausea, abdominal discomfort, and low-grade fever
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old girl presented with a 4-day history of non-specific viral symptoms and mild right upper quadrant tenderness. Blood tests showed a moderately raised ALT of 210 U/L and positive HEV IgM. The illness remained mild and self-limiting, with the patient returning to school within a fortnight as LFTs trended towards baseline.

acute_hepatitis_e_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis E with Severe Cholestasis
  presenting_complaint: Intense pruritus and deep jaundice
  summary_of_course: A 71-year-old female presented with a predominantly cholestatic picture, with a Bilirubin of 450 µmol/L and ALP of 600 U/L. HEV RNA was detected in the stool and serum, confirming acute infection. The course was prolonged by intractable itching requiring ursodeoxycholic acid and colestyramine, with jaundice taking twelve weeks to fully subside.

acute_hepatitis_e_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis E in G6PD Deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice, pallor, and dark red urine
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male with known G6PD deficiency developed acute HEV infection, which triggered a severe haemolytic crisis. He presented with a haemoglobin drop to 6.2 g/dL and an ALT of 1100 U/L. He required blood transfusions and aggressive hydration to prevent haemoglobinuric renal failure while the viral hepatitis resolved.

acute_hepatitis_e_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis E mimicking Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic elevation of transaminases
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male recently started on Atorvastatin was found to have an ALT of 850 U/L during routine monitoring. Initially suspected to be DILI, the statin was ceased, but transaminases continued to rise. Subsequent viral screening was positive for HEV IgM, confirming that the liver injury was infectious rather than drug-related.

acute_hepatitis_e_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis E with Cryoglobulinaemia
  presenting_complaint: Purpuric rash and joint pains
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male presented with a vasculitic rash on the lower limbs and arthralgia. Investigations revealed mixed cryoglobulinaemia, low complement levels, and an ALT of 340 U/L. Serology confirmed acute HEV infection; both the cutaneous vasculitis and the hepatitis resolved concurrently without the need for immunosuppression.

acute_hepatitis_e_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis E with Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive lower limb weakness and tingling
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female developed ascending paralysis two weeks after a self-limiting diarrhoeal illness. CSF analysis showed albuminocytologic dissociation, and serum testing was positive for HEV RNA. She was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for GBS, with her mildly elevated LFTs (ALT 180 U/L) resolving during the hospital stay.

acute_hepatitis_e_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute Hepatitis E in HIV infection
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old HIV-positive male with a CD4 count of 210 cells/µL presented with persistent lethargy and an ALT of 190 U/L. HEV RNA was detected at high titres, and due to the lack of clearance over 12 weeks, a diagnosis of subacute infection with high risk of chronicity was made. Ribavirin therapy was initiated to prevent progression to cirrhosis.

acute_hepatitis_e_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis E with Acute Pancreatitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe epigastric pain radiating to the back and jaundice
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male presented with clinical and biochemical evidence of acute pancreatitis (Amylase 1400 U/L) alongside an ALT of 1600 U/L. Gallstones and alcohol were excluded as causes, and HEV IgM returned positive. The pancreatitis was managed conservatively with intravenous fluids, and both the pancreatic and hepatic inflammation resolved over two weeks.

acute_hepatitis_e_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis E (Genotype 4)
  presenting_complaint: Diarrhoea, vomiting, and jaundice
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male presented after returning from a business trip to China, where he consumed various street foods. He exhibited classic icteric hepatitis with an ALT of 2200 U/L. Genotyping confirmed HEV Genotype 4, and the patient made a full recovery with supportive care within one month.

acute_hepatitis_e_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis E in an Occupational Setting
  presenting_complaint: Mild malaise and anorexia
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old pig farmer was screened following a cluster of cases in the local area. He reported only minor fatigue, but bloods showed an ALT of 550 U/L and positive HEV RNA. As an occupational exposure case, it was reported to public health, and he was advised to avoid alcohol until biochemical recovery was confirmed.

acute_hepatitis_e_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis E with Membranous Nephropathy
  presenting_complaint: Peripheral oedema and frothy urine
  summary_of_course: A 57-year-old male presented with nephrotic-range proteinuria and mild hepatitis (ALT 280 U/L). A renal biopsy demonstrated membranous nephropathy, and viral screening was positive for HEV RNA. The renal complications were attributed to HEV-induced immune complex deposition, and improvement in proteinuria followed the clearance of the viral infection.

acute_hepatitis_e_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis E with Ribavirin Treatment Failure
  presenting_complaint: Persistent jaundice and rising transaminases
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old heart transplant recipient developed HEV infection that rapidly progressed towards chronicity. Ribavirin was commenced but failed to clear the virus after six months, with HEV RNA remaining detectable. Sequencing identified a G1634R mutation in the polymerase region, necessitating a reduction in immunosuppression to facilitate immune-mediated viral clearance.

acute_hepatitis_e_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Acute Hepatitis E in an Elderly Patient
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, falls, and dark urine
  summary_of_course: An 84-year-old male was admitted following a fall, with subsequent bloods showing an ALT of 1100 U/L and Bilirubin of 180 µmol/L. Acute HEV was confirmed via IgM serology. His hospital stay was complicated by hospital-acquired pneumonia and transient acute kidney injury, but his liver function slowly improved over four weeks of inpatient geriatric care.

acute_hepatitis_e_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis E and Hepatitis B Co-infection
  presenting_complaint: Severe RUQ pain and jaundice
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old male with known inactive chronic Hepatitis B presented with a sudden "flare" of hepatitis (ALT 3500 U/L). Investigations revealed a low HBV DNA but positive HEV IgM and RNA, indicating acute HEV superinfection. He required close monitoring for hepatic decompensation but eventually cleared the HEV, with LFTs returning to his baseline chronic HBV state.

acute_hepatitis_e_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic Acute Hepatitis E
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding on blood donor screening
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female blood donor was notified by the transfusion service that her recent donation was positive for HEV RNA. She remained entirely asymptomatic with an ALT of only 55 U/L. Following standard UK protocols, she was deferred from future donations for six months and advised to follow up with her GP for a repeat LFT to ensure resolution.
