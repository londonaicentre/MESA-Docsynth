  primary_diagnosis: Seronegative Sjogren's Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Chronic dry eyes and mouth with negative antibody screens.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old female had classic sicca symptoms for three years but repeatedly tested negative for ANA, Ro, and La antibodies. Due to high clinical suspicion, a minor salivary gland biopsy was performed, revealing a focus score of 2.2. This confirmed seronegative Sjogren's syndrome, allowing her access to specialist ophthalmic ciclosporin drops.

sicca_syndrome_sjogren_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Sjogren's Syndrome with Neonatal Lupus Risk
  presenting_complaint: Routine obstetric review in a patient with known Sjogren's.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant female, known to be strongly anti-Ro and anti-La positive, required intensive foetal monitoring. At 22 weeks, foetal echocardiography was performed to screen for congenital heart block, a known risk in Sjogren's pregnancies. She remained on hydroxychloroquine throughout the pregnancy, and the neonate was born healthy with no conduction defects.

sicca_syndrome_sjogren_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Transverse Myelitis in Sjogren's Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of lower limb weakness and urinary retention.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old female was admitted as an emergency with a sensory level at T10 and inability to void. MRI spine showed an extensive T2-hyperintense lesion, and subsequent workup for aetiology revealed previously undiagnosed Sjogren's syndrome. She was treated with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone and plasma exchange for life-threatening CNS involvement.
