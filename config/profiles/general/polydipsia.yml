polydipsia_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus
  presenting_complaint: Extreme thirst, frequent urination, and 5kg weight loss over two weeks.
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old boy presented with acute onset polydipsia and polyuria. Bedside capillary blood glucose was 26.4 mmol/L with ketones of 4.2 mmol/L, confirming diabetic ketoacidosis. He was stabilised with intravenous fluids and an insulin infusion before transitioning to a subcutaneous basal-bolus regimen.

polydipsia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Psychogenic Polydipsia
  presenting_complaint: Compulsive water drinking of up to 12 litres per day and intermittent confusion.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia presented to A&E with a seizure. Investigations revealed profound hyponatraemia (sodium 118 mmol/L) due to excessive water intake. He was treated with fluid restriction and psychiatric review to manage his compulsive behaviour in a secure setting.

polydipsia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Central Diabetes Insipidus
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of intense thirst and massive urine output following head trauma.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female was admitted to the ICU following a road traffic accident involving a base of skull fracture. She developed polyuria (>500ml/hr) and rising serum osmolality despite high oral intake. Diagnosis was confirmed via a water deprivation test, and she showed a rapid response to intranasal desmopressin.

polydipsia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Lithium-induced Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus
  presenting_complaint: Chronic thirst and nocturia interfering with sleep.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old woman on long-term lithium for bipolar disorder reported drinking 6-8 litres of water daily for several years. Investigations showed a high-normal serum sodium and low urine osmolality that failed to respond to exogenous vasopressin. Lithium was tapered under psychiatric supervision, and amiloride was started to manage the renal resistance.

polydipsia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypercalcaemia of Malignancy
  presenting_complaint: Thirst, constipation, and worsening lethargy.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male smoker presented with subacute polydipsia and weight loss. Blood tests revealed a corrected calcium of 3.45 mmol/L, and a chest X-ray identified a suspicious hilar mass. He was treated with aggressive intravenous rehydration and bisphosphonates while awaiting staging for suspected bronchial carcinoma.

polydipsia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Gestational Diabetes Mellitus
  presenting_complaint: Increased thirst and fatigue at 26 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old primigravida woman reported persistent thirst despite adequate hydration. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) confirmed gestational diabetes with a 2-hour post-load glucose of 9.8 mmol/L. She was successfully managed with dietary modifications and metformin, resulting in the resolution of her polydipsia.

polydipsia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Hyperosmolar Hyperglycaemic State (HHS)
  presenting_complaint: Severe dehydration, polydipsia, and altered mental state.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with Type 2 Diabetes was admitted from a care home with a one-week history of excessive drinking and progressive weakness. Laboratory results showed a glucose of 54 mmol/L and serum osmolality of 360 mOsm/kg. He required intensive fluid resuscitation and low-dose insulin, with a slow recovery over several days in the high dependency unit.

polydipsia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Sjogren’s Syndrome (Pseudo-polydipsia)
  presenting_complaint: Constant sipping of water due to an extremely dry mouth.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female presented with what she described as "unquenchable thirst" for six months. Clinical examination revealed dry mucous membranes and dental caries, but normal serum glucose and osmolality. Positive anti-Ro/La antibodies and a labial gland biopsy confirmed Sjogren’s, and her symptoms improved with saliva substitutes and pilocarpine.

polydipsia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Congenital Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus
  presenting_complaint: Irritability, poor feeding, and heavy wet nappies in an infant.
  summary_of_course: A 6-month-old male infant presented with failure to thrive and recurrent episodes of unexplained fever. Investigations showed persistent hypernatraemia and very dilute urine despite dehydration. Genetic testing confirmed a mutation in the AVPR2 gene, and the infant was managed with a low-solute formula and hydrochlorothiazide.

polydipsia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Kidney Disease (Stage 4)
  presenting_complaint: Mild thirst, nocturia, and bilateral ankle swelling.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with long-standing hypertension presented for a routine review. Bloods showed an eGFR of 22 mL/min/1.73m² and elevated urea. His polydipsia was attributed to the loss of renal concentrating ability associated with advanced tubulointerstitial damage.

polydipsia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary Hyperparathyroidism
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent kidney stones, thirst, and bone pain.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old woman was investigated for polydipsia and nephrolithiasis. Biochemistry showed a corrected calcium of 2.82 mmol/L with an inappropriately high PTH level. A Sestamibi scan located a parathyroid adenoma, and her thirst resolved completely following a successful parathyroidectomy.

polydipsia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Conn’s Syndrome (Primary Aldosteronism)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent thirst and muscle weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with resistant hypertension was found to have a serum potassium of 2.9 mmol/L. The resulting hypokalaemia-induced renal resistance to ADH caused mild polydipsia and polyuria. Following an adrenal vein sampling and subsequent unilateral adrenalectomy, his blood pressure and potassium levels normalised.

polydipsia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Craniopharyngioma
  presenting_complaint: Headaches, visual field defects, and increased water intake.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old boy presented with a three-month history of subacute polydipsia and declining school performance. MRI Brain revealed a suprasellar cystic mass compressing the hypothalamus and optic chiasm. He developed permanent central diabetes insipidus post-operatively, requiring life-long desmopressin and pituitary hormone replacement.

polydipsia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Beer Potomania
  presenting_complaint: Dizziness, polydipsia, and gait instability.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with a history of heavy alcohol intake (12 units of beer daily) and poor oral intake presented with symptomatic hyponatraemia. His "thirst" was driven by excessive fluid intake with very low solute load, overwhelming the kidneys' ability to excrete free water. He was treated with slow sodium correction and nutritional support to avoid osmotic demyelination syndrome.

polydipsia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Sarcoidosis
  presenting_complaint: Dry cough, thirst, and blurred vision.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male presented with multisystem symptoms. Investigations revealed hypercalcaemia and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy on CT. The polydipsia was secondary to hypercalciuria-induced nephrogenic DI and granulomatous involvement of the hypothalamus; symptoms responded well to systemic corticosteroids.

polydipsia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Factitious Disorder
  presenting_complaint: Claims of drinking 20 litres of water daily and requiring "special medication."
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old female with multiple previous admissions for "diabetes insipidus" was found to have normal water deprivation test results when strictly supervised. Nursing staff observed her covertly filling water jugs from the bathroom tap. Psychiatric evaluation suggested factitious disorder, and she was referred for cognitive behavioural therapy.

polydipsia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Diuretic-induced Polydipsia
  presenting_complaint: Dry mouth and increased fluid intake since starting new medication.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male with congestive heart failure was started on high-dose furosemide. He reported significant thirst, which led to excessive water intake that antagonised his heart failure management. His diuretic dose was adjusted, and he was counselled on fluid restriction and using ice chips to manage the sensation of dry mouth.

polydipsia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Wolfram Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Early-onset diabetes mellitus and progressive thirst.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with known juvenile-onset diabetes presented with new-onset polyuria that did not respond to increased insulin. Further testing revealed optic atrophy and central diabetes insipidus (DIDMOAD syndrome). He was started on desmopressin, and genetic counselling was provided for his family.

polydipsia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Ectopic ACTH Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Rapid onset weight gain, thirst, and proximal muscle weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female with small cell lung cancer developed severe hypokalaemia and hyperglycaemia. The polydipsia was multifactorial, driven by both secondary diabetes and hypokalaemia-induced renal concentrating defects. Management focused on treating the underlying malignancy and using ketoconazole to block cortisol synthesis.

polydipsia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Dipsogenic Polydipsia
  presenting_complaint: Excessive thirst following a neurosurgical procedure.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male underwent clipping of an anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Post-operatively, he developed a lowered "thirst threshold," drinking water even when plasma osmolality was low. Unlike central DI, his ADH levels were appropriate for his osmolality, and he was managed with behavioural interventions and scheduled fluid intake.
