  primary_diagnosis: Ruptured AAA post-EVAR (Type 1a Endoleak)
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal pain two years after aneurysm stenting
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male with a previous EVAR presented with hypotension and abdominal guarding. Imaging revealed a Type 1a endoleak with a ruptured sac. He required emergency proximal extension of the stent-graft and chimney renal stenting to secure the seal zone.

aortic_aneurysm_ruptured_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Ruptured Inflammatory Aortic Aneurysm
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss, raised ESR, and sudden flank pain
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with a history of chronic periaortic inflammation presented with acute pain. CT showed a thickened aortic wall with a "mantle sign" and fresh retroperitoneal blood. He was treated with emergency open surgery, which was technically difficult due to dense adhesions to the duodenum and ureters.

aortic_aneurysm_ruptured_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Ruptured Aorta in Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Sudden abdominal pain and rapid clinical deterioration
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female with known vEDS presented in extremis. Emergency laparotomy revealed a spontaneous rupture of the mid-abdominal aorta. Despite multiple attempts to suture the extremely friable vascular tissue, the patient suffered uncontrollable haemorrhage and died intraoperatively.

aortic_aneurysm_ruptured_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Ruptured Suprarenal Aortic Aneurysm
  presenting_complaint: Epigastric pain and acute oliguria
  summary_of_course: A 71-year-old male presented with severe upper abdominal pain and anuria. CT showed a ruptured aneurysm involving the origins of the renal arteries.

  primary_diagnosis: Ruptured AAA with Horseshoe Kidney
  presenting_complaint: Severe lower back pain and hypotension
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male with a known horseshoe kidney presented with a ruptured AAA. The surgical repair was complicated by the renal isthmus crossing the aneurysm and multiple accessory renal arteries arising from the aneurysmal sac. The isthmus was divided and the aneurysm repaired with careful preservation of renal perfusion.

  primary_diagnosis: Ruptured Thoracoabdominal Aneurysm
  presenting_complaint: Severe back pain and new-onset paraplegia
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male presented with acute back pain and loss of motor function in his legs. CT showed a Crawford Type II thoracoabdominal aneurysm rupture. Despite emergency surgical intervention, the spinal cord ischaemia was irreversible, leaving the patient with permanent paraplegia.

aortic_aneurysm_ruptured_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic Aortic Rupture
  presenting_complaint: Sudden hypotension during TAVI procedure
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female underwent a Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI). During the procedure, the stiff guidewire perforated the calcified aortic arch, leading to an acute rupture into the mediastinum.
