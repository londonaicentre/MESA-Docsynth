compartment_syndrome_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute compartment syndrome of the lower leg
  presenting_complaint: Severe left calf pain and paraesthesia following a motor vehicle accident
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old male presented to A&E with a closed tibial shaft fracture. Despite immobilisation, he developed pain out of proportion to the injury and tense swelling. Intracompartmental pressure was measured at 45 mmHg (delta pressure 18 mmHg), confirming the diagnosis. He underwent emergent four-compartment fasciotomy, with subsequent wound closure five days later and a good functional recovery.

compartment_syndrome_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute forearm compartment syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Increasing pain on passive finger extension following a fall
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy sustained a displaced supracondylar humerus fracture. Post-reduction, he developed worsening volar forearm pain and reduced capillary refill. Clinical diagnosis of compartment syndrome was made based on escalating opioid requirements and pain on passive stretch. Urgent fasciotomy revealed bulging, ischaemic muscle which reperfused upon release; he required long-term physiotherapy for grip strength.

compartment_syndrome_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS)
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral aching and tightness in shins during long-distance running
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female athlete reported predictable pain after 20 minutes of running, which resolved with rest but hindered performance. Physical examination and X-rays were normal, but pre- and post-exercise manometry showed resting pressures of 15 mmHg rising to 45 mmHg post-exertion. She was managed with elective bilateral subcutaneous fasciotomies after conservative measures failed, allowing a return to competitive sports.

compartment_syndrome_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute thigh compartment syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Massive right thigh swelling and numbness after a low-energy fall
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male on warfarin for atrial fibrillation presented with a large haematoma following a fall. His INR was supra-therapeutic at 5.2, and he developed tense thigh swelling with femoral nerve sensory loss. CT angiography confirmed a ruptured profunda femoris branch contributing to compartment hypertension. He underwent haematoma evacuation and fasciotomy alongside reversal of anticoagulation with prothrombin complex concentrate.

compartment_syndrome_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Reperfusion-induced compartment syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Severe calf pain following vascular bypass surgery
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male underwent a femoral-popliteal bypass for critical limb ischaemia. Postoperatively, following restoration of blood flow to the previously ischaemic limb, he developed significant calf oedema and motor weakness. Despite palpable pulses, the clinical suspicion of reperfusion compartment syndrome led to immediate fasciotomy. The muscle showed significant oedema but remained viable, and he was discharged with a vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) dressing.

compartment_syndrome_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Abdominal compartment syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Distended abdomen, oliguria, and rising airway pressures in ITU
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female was admitted to intensive care following a ruptured AAA repair requiring massive transfusion (20 units RBC). She developed a tense abdomen with bladder pressures of 28 mmHg and declining renal function. A diagnosis of secondary abdominal compartment syndrome was made, necessitating an emergency decompressive laparotomy in the unit. The abdomen was left open with a temporary mesh, which was closed once the visceral oedema subsided.

compartment_syndrome_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic compartment syndrome due to tight casting
  presenting_complaint: Persistent crying and pale toes in a toddler after fracture manipulation
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old girl had a full-circle plaster cast applied for a buckle fracture of the tibia. Six hours later, her parents returned to A&E as she was inconsolable and her toes were cool to the touch. Upon bivalving the cast, a significant improvement in perfusion was noted, but clinical signs of compartment syndrome persisted. She underwent emergency fasciotomies, which revealed superficial muscle necrosis due to delayed cast removal.

compartment_syndrome_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Gluteal compartment syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Left buttock pain and sciatic nerve palsy following drug overdose
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male was found unconscious after a heroin overdose, having lain on a hard floor for approximately 14 hours. He presented with a tense, ecchymotic left buttock and foot drop (sciatic nerve distribution). Investigations showed a serum creatine kinase (CK) of 45,000 U/L and acute kidney injury. Gluteal fasciotomy was performed to prevent further nerve damage and manage rhabdomyolysis, followed by aggressive fluid resuscitation and temporary haemodialysis.

compartment_syndrome_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute hand compartment syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Excruciating pain and swelling of the palm after a grease gun injury
  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old mechanic sustained a high-pressure injection injury to the thenar eminence. Within two hours, the hand became extremely swollen, pale, and exquisitely tender. Given the high-risk mechanism and clinical signs, he was taken to theatre for urgent exploration and decompression of the thenar and mid-palmar spaces. Chemical debridement of the grease was required alongside the fasciotomy to salvage hand function.

compartment_syndrome_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute foot compartment syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Severe midfoot pain and inability to weight bear after a crush injury
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old construction worker sustained a Lisfranc fracture-dislocation when a heavy palette fell on his foot. Despite reduction and pinning, the foot remained excessively swollen with loss of sensation in the first web space. Compartment pressures in the interosseous and central compartments were measured at 38 mmHg. Dual dorsal incisions were used for decompression, successfully preventing long-term clawing of the toes and intrinsic muscle contractures.

compartment_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic exertional compartment syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, non-resolving calf pain during basic training
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old military recruit with a history of recurrent shin splints experienced a sudden "pop" followed by worsening, persistent pain during a forced march. Examination revealed tense swelling of the anterior compartment and weakness in ankle dorsiflexion. It was determined that a minor muscle tear had led to an acute haematoma within a chronically thickened fascial sheath. Urgent fasciotomy was required, and he was subsequently medically discharged from the army.

compartment_syndrome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Spontaneous compartment syndrome in Haemophilia
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressing forearm swelling without trauma
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old boy with known Haemophilia A presented with spontaneous pain and swelling in his right volar forearm. Despite prompt administration of Factor VIII concentrate, his symptoms progressed to include paraesthesia and pain on passive finger extension. Pressure monitoring confirmed compartment syndrome (42 mmHg). He underwent fasciotomy under continuous factor replacement cover; postoperative course was complicated by a wound haematoma but resulted in no neurological deficit.

compartment_syndrome_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute compartment syndrome secondary to circumferential burns
  presenting_complaint: Loss of distal pulses and leathery skin tightness in a burnt limb
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male sustained 30% total body surface area burns, including circumferential full-thickness burns to the right leg. During fluid resuscitation, his distal pulses became impalpable and the limb became cold. Escharotomies were initially performed at the bedside, but deep compartment pressures remained elevated at 35 mmHg. He was taken to theatre for formal fasciotomies beneath the burnt tissue to prevent total limb loss.

compartment_syndrome_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute compartment syndrome due to contrast extravasation
  presenting_complaint: Sudden forearm pain and skin tension during a CT scan
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male underwent a CT urogram where 125ml of iodinated contrast was accidentally extravasated into the antecubital fossa via a high-pressure injector. The forearm became acutely tense and cold within 30 minutes. Initial conservative management with elevation and hyaluronidase failed to reduce the pressure. A volar compartment fasciotomy was performed, revealing extensive tissue oedema and chemical irritation from the contrast medium.

compartment_syndrome_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Late-presentation compartment syndrome with necrosis
  presenting_complaint: Foul-smelling leg wound and confusion
  summary_of_course: An 83-year-old female lived alone and was found 48 hours after a fall. She had a non-displaced tibial fracture but the leg was cold, purple, and insensate. Upon arrival at the hospital, she was in septic shock with a CK of 100,000 U/L and dark urine. Emergency surgery revealed global necrosis of the anterior and lateral compartments; due to the risk of life-threatening reperfusion injury and systemic sepsis, an above-knee amputation was performed.

compartment_syndrome_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute compartment syndrome with Volkmann’s contracture
  presenting_complaint: Permanent flexion of the wrist and fingers following an old injury
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy presented with a "claw hand" three months after a conservatively managed forearm fracture abroad. History revealed a period of intense pain and swelling that was treated with analgesia only. Clinical examination confirmed Volkmann's ischaemic contracture, a sequela of missed subacute compartment syndrome. He required extensive tendon lengthening and neurolysis, but significant functional impairment persisted.

compartment_syndrome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute compartment syndrome secondary to snake envenomation
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly spreading swelling and pain following an Adder bite
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old hiker was bitten on the ankle by a Vipera berus (European Adder). Within 4 hours, the swelling had progressed to the mid-calf with significant ecchymosis and pain on passive movement. Despite antivenom administration, compartment pressures rose to 34 mmHg. A cautious fasciotomy was performed to manage the localised tissue toxicity and pressure, though the wound healing was significantly delayed by the venom's proteolytic effects.

compartment_syndrome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Bilateral lower limb compartment syndrome (Positioning related)
  presenting_complaint: Severe bilateral calf pain post-prolonged pelvic surgery
  summary_of_course: A 56-year-old male underwent an 8-hour robotic prostatectomy in the steep Trendelenburg position with legs in lithotomy stirrups. In the recovery room, he complained of intense bilateral calf pain despite an epidural. CK was elevated at 12,000 U/L and shins were "rock hard." Bilateral four-compartment fasciotomies were performed; the cause was attributed to prolonged impaired venous return and local pressure from the stirrups.

compartment_syndrome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute thigh compartment syndrome with rhabdomyolysis
  presenting_complaint: Crushing leg pain and dark urine after a workplace accident
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old man was pinned under a heavy steel beam for 3 hours. On rescue, his right thigh was massive and tense. He arrived at the trauma centre with myoglobinuria and a CK of 80,000 U/L. To prevent further muscle ischaemia and manage the systemic effects of rhabdomyolysis, he underwent immediate thigh fasciotomy and aggressive alkalinised fluid resuscitation to protect renal function.

compartment_syndrome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute compartment syndrome of the arm (Infectious/Inflammatory)
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressing arm swelling and fever
  summary_of_course: A 49-year-old female with poorly controlled diabetes presented with what appeared to be severe cellulitis of the upper arm. However, the pain was disproportionate to the redness, and she developed numbness in the median nerve distribution. Surgical exploration for suspected necrotising fasciitis revealed instead an acute compartment syndrome caused by deep-seated pyomyositis. Decompression and debridement of the infected muscle were performed, followed by long-term intravenous antibiotics.
