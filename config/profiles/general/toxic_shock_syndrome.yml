  primary_diagnosis: TSS in an Immunocompromised Patient
  presenting_complaint: Fever and localized skin infection in an HIV-positive patient.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male with poorly controlled HIV (CD4 count 150) presented with a small abscess on his arm and systemic toxicity. He developed refractory shock and multi-organ failure; cultures identified MRSA producing TSST-1. Despite linezolid and IVIG, the patient succumbed to multi-organ failure on day 4.

toxic_shock_syndrome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Elderly TSS secondary to Chronic Ulcer
  presenting_complaint: Confusion and hypotension in an elderly patient.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with a chronic venous leg ulcer presented with acute-on-chronic deterioration. She was hypothermic (35.8°C) and hypotensive, initially misdiagnosed as simple urosepsis. Recognition of a faint macular rash led to a diagnosis of S. aureus TSS; she required vasopressor support but survived with significant renal impairment.
