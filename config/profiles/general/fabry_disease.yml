fabry_disease_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Classic Fabry disease
  presenting_complaint: Burning pain in hands and feet (acroparesthesia) and heat intolerance.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy presented with chronic, severe burning sensations in his extremities, exacerbated by physical education at school. Clinical examination revealed sparse angiokeratomas on the trunk and hypohidrosis. Low alpha-galactosidase A activity and a GLA mutation confirmed the diagnosis; he was commenced on enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with agalsidase alfa.

fabry_disease_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Late-onset cardiac variant Fabry disease
  presenting_complaint: Progressive exertional dyspnoea and palpitations.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with a history of presumed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) presented with worsening heart failure symptoms. Cardiac MRI showed significant left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and late gadolinium enhancement in the inferolateral wall. Genetic testing identified a missense mutation (N215S), and he was started on migalastat following confirmation of an amenable mutation.

fabry_disease_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Fabry disease in a symptomatic female heterozygote
  presenting_complaint: Foamy urine and persistent fatigue.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old woman was investigated for unexplained proteinuria (uPCR 120 mg/mmol). Despite normal alpha-galactosidase A levels, genetic testing confirmed a GLA pathogenic variant, and renal biopsy showed characteristic myelinoid figures (Zebra bodies) in podocytes. She was started on an ACE inhibitor and agalsidase beta to slow renal decline.

fabry_disease_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Fabry crisis
  presenting_complaint: Acute, debilitating limb pain and low-grade pyrexia.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old male with known Fabry disease presented to the emergency department with an acute "Fabry crisis" triggered by an influenza infection. He required intravenous analgesia and intensive hydration to manage the neuropathic pain. His regular ERT dose was maintained, and he was discharged with an optimised gabapentin regimen.

fabry_disease_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Fabry disease presenting as cryptogenic stroke
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset left-sided weakness and facial droop.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male presented with an acute ischaemic stroke in the right middle cerebral artery territory. Extensive workup for young-onset stroke revealed no embolic source, but an MRI brain showed a "pulvinar sign" on T1-weighted images. Subsequent enzymatic assays confirmed Fabry disease, and secondary prevention was initiated alongside ERT.

fabry_disease_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Fabry disease with predominant gastrointestinal manifestations
  presenting_complaint: Chronic post-prandial abdominal pain and frequent diarrhoea.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old female had been misdiagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) for six years. Following the diagnosis of Fabry disease in her brother, she underwent screening which revealed elevated Lyso-Gb3 levels. Her GI symptoms improved significantly after six months of enzyme replacement therapy.

fabry_disease_007:
  primary_diagnosis: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to Fabry disease
  presenting_complaint: Uraemic symptoms and fluid overload.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male, previously undiagnosed, presented with Stage 5 chronic kidney disease (eGFR 8 ml/min/1.73m2). Cutaneous examination revealed extensive angiokeratomas in the "bathing trunk" distribution. He commenced haemodialysis and was placed on the renal transplant waiting list, with ERT started to protect extra-renal organs.

fabry_disease_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Fabry disease with multi-organ involvement
  presenting_complaint: Tinnitus, hearing loss, and exertional chest pain.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male presented with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and angina. Investigations revealed concentric LVH and mild proteinuria, with a family history of early-onset renal failure. Diagnosis was confirmed via GLA gene sequencing, and he was managed with a combination of ERT, hearing aids, and beta-blockers.

fabry_disease_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Classic Fabry disease with ERT antibody formation
  presenting_complaint: Recurrence of neuropathic pain and rising Lyso-Gb3 levels.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male on long-term agalsidase beta showed a plateau in clinical improvement and a secondary rise in plasma Lyso-Gb3. High-titre anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) were detected, neutralising the enzyme activity. His treatment was switched to an alternative ERT formulation with close monitoring of his renal and cardiac parameters.

fabry_disease_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Fabry disease (Ocular focus)
  presenting_complaint: Routine optician visit finding.
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old girl was referred to ophthalmology after a routine eye exam noted corneal verticillata (vortex keratopathy). She was otherwise asymptomatic, but family screening confirmed a GLA mutation inherited from her mother. She remains under annual multi-disciplinary review, with treatment deferred until clinical symptoms or biomarkers indicate progression.

fabry_disease_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Fabry disease with life-threatening arrhythmia
  presenting_complaint: Syncope during light exercise.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with known Fabry-related cardiomyopathy experienced a syncopal episode. A 24-hour Holter monitor captured non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), and he was admitted for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) insertion. His cardiac status was further stabilised with uptitration of heart failure medications and ERT.

fabry_disease_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Fabry disease misdiagnosed as Rheumatoid Arthritis
  presenting_complaint: Chronic joint pain and swelling in hands.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male had been treated for seronegative rheumatoid arthritis for years with minimal response to DMARDs. A review of his symptoms highlighted a lack of inflammatory markers and the presence of hypohidrosis. Fabry disease was confirmed, explaining the "joint" pain which was actually severe acroparesthesia.

fabry_disease_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic kidney injury in Fabry disease
  presenting_complaint: Reduced urine output and peripheral oedema.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male with known Fabry-related CKD Stage 3 developed AKI after taking high-dose NSAIDs for back pain. He required hospital admission for fluid management and temporary cessation of his ACE inhibitor. His renal function returned to baseline (eGFR 35) following supportive care and education on avoiding nephrotoxic agents.

fabry_disease_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Atypical Fabry disease (Renal variant)
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of proteinuria during insurance medical.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with no prior medical history was found to have a uPCR of 150 mg/mmol. Renal biopsy showed moderate podocyte vacuolation and zebra bodies, but cardiac and neurological exams were entirely normal. Genetic testing revealed a late-onset renal variant mutation, and he was started on agalsidase alfa.

fabry_disease_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Fabry disease in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Management of known disease during second trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old pregnant female with Fabry disease was monitored closely by a specialist metabolic-obstetric clinic. Her ERT (agalsidase alfa) was continued throughout pregnancy without adverse effects. She delivered a healthy neonate via elective C-section; postnatal genetic counselling was provided for the infant.

fabry_disease_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Fabry disease with severe depression and chronic pain
  presenting_complaint: Low mood and poorly controlled neuropathic pain.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old male with classic Fabry disease presented with suicidal ideation linked to intractable limb pain. He was admitted to a psychiatric ward while his pain regimen was overhauled to include duloxetine and lignocaine patches. A multidisciplinary approach involving metabolic specialists and psychologists improved his quality of life.

fabry_disease_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Fabry disease with comorbid Type 2 Diabetes
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly declining renal function.
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old male with both Fabry disease and Type 2 Diabetes presented with an eGFR drop from 50 to 30 within one year. The clinical challenge was distinguishing between diabetic nephropathy and Fabry podocytopathy. Optimisation of both glycaemic control (SGLT2 inhibitor) and Fabry-specific therapy was required to stabilise his condition.

fabry_disease_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Fabry disease (Late diagnosis in elderly)
  presenting_complaint: New-onset atrial fibrillation and mild cognitive impairment.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male was diagnosed with Fabry disease following the diagnosis of his grandson. Retrospective review showed he had long-standing LVH and "idiopathic" small vessel disease on brain MRI. While too late for significant reversal of damage, he was started on low-dose ERT to prevent further multi-organ complications.

fabry_disease_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Fabry disease with autonomic dysfunction
  presenting_complaint: Orthostatic hypotension and severe heat intolerance.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male presented with frequent near-syncope when standing and an inability to tolerate warm environments. Autonomic testing confirmed sudomotor dysfunction and impaired orthostatic responses. Along with ERT, he was managed with midodrine and lifestyle modifications to manage his dysautonomia.

fabry_disease_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-transplant Fabry disease management
  presenting_complaint: Routine follow-up post-renal transplant.
  summary_of_course: A 56-year-old male, five years post-deceased donor renal transplant for Fabry-related ESRD, presented for review. While his graft function was stable (eGFR 55), his cardiac MRI showed progressive fibrosis. His ERT dose was adjusted, and he was screened for Fabry-related complications in the transplanted kidney, though recurrence is rare.
