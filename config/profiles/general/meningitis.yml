  primary_diagnosis: Post-neurosurgical Staphylococcus aureus meningitis
  presenting_complaint: Fever and discharge from a recent craniotomy site.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male, 10 days post-resection of a glioblastoma, developed rising inflammatory markers and reduced GCS. CSF obtained via the surgical drain showed Gram-positive cocci in clusters. He required surgical debridement of the wound and a 4-week course of IV flucloxacillin.

meningitis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Lyme meningitis (Neuroborreliosis)
  presenting_complaint: Facial nerve palsy, radicular pain, and mild headache.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old hiker presented in late summer with a unilateral Bell's palsy and lymphocytic meningitis. History revealed a previous "bullseye" rash (erythema migrans) on the thigh. Borrelia burgdorferi serology and CSF antibodies were positive, and he was treated with a 21-day course of IV ceftriaxone.

  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male was initially treated by his GP for "sinusitis" with oral amoxicillin. He presented to hospital 4 days later with ongoing meningism but CSF cultures remained sterile due to the prior antibiotic dose. PCR for Neisseria meningitidis was eventually positive, allowing for targeted IV therapy.

  presenting_complaint: Sudden "thunderclap" headache and severe meningeal irritation.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old female presented with symptoms mimicking a subarachnoid haemorrhage. CT was negative for blood, but LP showed an intensely inflammatory CSF with numerous squamous cells. MRI confirmed a ruptured intracranial dermoid cyst, leaking sebaceous material into the subarachnoid space, causing a sterile chemical meningitis.

  presenting_complaint: Worsening headache and vomiting despite antibiotic treatment.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female with S. pneumoniae meningitis initially improved on IV ceftriaxone but developed increasing drowsiness on day 7. Repeat imaging showed communicating hydrocephalus due to impaired CSF resorption by the arachnoid granulations. She required the temporary insertion of an external ventricular drain (EVD) before clinical stabilisation.

  presenting_complaint: Fever, jaundice, and severe headache after canal swimming.
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old male presented with a biphasic illness involving high fever, conjunctival suffusion, and subsequent meningism.
