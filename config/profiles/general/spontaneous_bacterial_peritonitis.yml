spontaneous_bacterial_peritonitis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
  presenting_complaint: Generalised abdominal pain and pyrexia
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with known alcoholic cirrhosis presented with a 2-day history of diffuse abdominal tenderness and a temperature of 38.5°C. Diagnostic paracentesis revealed an ascitic fluid neutrophil count of 620 cells/mm³ and Gram-negative bacilli on culture. He was treated with IV cefotaxime 2g TDS and 20% human albumin solution, resulting in rapid clinical improvement and resolution of the infection.

spontaneous_bacterial_peritonitis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Culture-negative neutrocytic ascites
  presenting_complaint: Increasing abdominal girth and mild confusion
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old female with NASH-related cirrhosis was seen in the outpatient clinic with worsening ascites and Grade 1 hepatic encephalopathy. Routine ascitic tap showed a polymorphonuclear (PMN) count of 450 cells/mm³ but subsequent cultures remained sterile. Despite the negative culture, she was treated for SBP with a 5-day course of oral ofloxacin, leading to the resolution of her symptoms.

spontaneous_bacterial_peritonitis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe SBP with Hepatorenal Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal pain and reduced urine output
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with decompensated cirrhosis presented in septic shock with a tense, painful abdomen and anuria. Ascitic fluid analysis confirmed SBP (PMN 2,400 cells/mm³) complicated by Type 1 hepatorenal syndrome (creatinine 310 µmol/L). He required ICU admission for vasopressor support, IV ceftriaxone, and a combination of terlipressin and albumin infusions.

spontaneous_bacterial_peritonitis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
  presenting_complaint: Irritability, vomiting, and abdominal distension
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old girl with biliary atresia and portal hypertension presented with acute-onset vomiting and a tender abdomen. Paracentesis confirmed SBP with a PMN count of 550 cells/mm³ growing Streptococcus pneumoniae. She was successfully treated with IV cefotaxime and monitored closely for signs of worsening liver synthetic function.

spontaneous_bacterial_peritonitis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Monomicrobial non-neutrocytic bacterascites
  presenting_complaint: Routine paracentesis for refractory ascites
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with cryptogenic cirrhosis underwent large-volume paracentesis for symptom relief. Although the ascitic PMN count was only 120 cells/mm³, the culture grew Escherichia coli. Because he developed a low-grade fever 24 hours later, he was treated as an inpatient with IV antibiotics to prevent progression to overt SBP.

spontaneous_bacterial_peritonitis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Multi-drug resistant SBP
  presenting_complaint: Persistent fever despite 48 hours of cephalosporins
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old female with Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) and frequent hospital admissions was admitted with SBP. Initial treatment with IV ceftriaxone failed to reduce the ascitic PMN count significantly at 48 hours. Cultures eventually identified ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, necessitating a switch to IV meropenem based on sensitivities.

spontaneous_bacterial_peritonitis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: SBP secondary to Enterococcus faecalis
  presenting_complaint: Subacute abdominal discomfort and jaundice
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male with alcoholic liver disease presented with worsening jaundice and vague abdominal bloating. Ascitic fluid analysis showed a PMN count of 310 cells/mm³ and culture-positive Enterococcus faecalis. Given the Gram-positive result and previous penicillin allergy, he was treated with IV vancomycin, leading to a steady decline in inflammatory markers.

spontaneous_bacterial_peritonitis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: SBP in the setting of Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure
  presenting_complaint: Coma and multi-organ failure
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis-related cirrhosis presented with Grade 4 hepatic encephalopathy and jaundice (bilirubin 450 µmol/L). SBP was diagnosed on admission (PMN 800 cells/mm³) as the precipitant for ACLF. Despite aggressive antibiotic therapy and ICU support, the patient’s condition deteriorated, and she was prioritised for emergency liver transplantation assessment.

spontaneous_bacterial_peritonitis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent SBP on prophylaxis
  presenting_complaint: New-onset rigors and abdominal tenderness
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male who was already taking norfloxacin 400mg daily for SBP prophylaxis presented with breakthrough infection. Ascitic tap showed a PMN count of 1,100 cells/mm³ and sensitivities showed a quinolone-resistant E. coli. He was treated with IV piperacillin/tazobactam and his prophylaxis was subsequently reviewed.

spontaneous_bacterial_peritonitis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: SBP following variceal haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Haematemesis followed by fever 3 days later
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male was admitted with a major upper GI bleed from oesophageal varices. Despite prophylactic ceftriaxone at the time of endoscopy, he developed a fever and abdominal pain on day 3. Paracentesis confirmed SBP (PMN 420 cells/mm³), likely due to bacterial translocation during the haemorrhagic event, requiring an extended course of IV antibiotics.

spontaneous_bacterial_peritonitis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Spontaneous bacterial pleuritis (SBP variant)
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male with cirrhosis and a chronic right-sided hepatic hydrothorax presented with acute respiratory distress. Thoracocentesis revealed a pleural fluid PMN count of >250 cells/mm³ with no evidence of pneumonia on CT, confirming spontaneous bacterial empyema (SBEM). He was treated with IV antibiotics and albumin as per SBP protocols.

spontaneous_bacterial_peritonitis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: SBP in cardiac cirrhosis
  presenting_complaint: Right upper quadrant pain and worsening peripheral oedema
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with chronic congestive heart failure and secondary cardiac cirrhosis presented with new-onset ascites and fever. Although SBP is rarer in non-portal hypertensive ascites, paracentesis confirmed a PMN count of 350 cells/mm³. He was treated with IV cefotaxime with careful fluid balance monitoring to avoid exacerbating his heart failure.

spontaneous_bacterial_peritonitis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute SBP with minimal symptoms
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue and mild anorexia
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with NASH cirrhosis and multiple comorbidities was brought in by her family due to increased lethargy. She was afebrile with no abdominal pain, but a diagnostic tap performed due to the unexplained decline showed 290 PMN cells/mm³. She responded well to a course of IV ceftriaxone, highlighting the need for a high index of suspicion in the elderly.

spontaneous_bacterial_peritonitis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: SBP with MRSA bacteraemia
  presenting_complaint: High fever and hypotension
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male with a history of IVDU and Hepatitis C-related cirrhosis presented with sepsis. Ascitic fluid PMN count was 1,500 cells/mm³ and blood cultures grew Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Treatment was initiated with IV vancomycin and daptomycin, and a source search revealed an infected peripheral venous catheter site.

spontaneous_bacterial_peritonitis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: SBP masking secondary peritonitis
  presenting_complaint: Acute, localised surgical voice abdominal pain
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with cirrhosis presented with what initially appeared to be SBP (PMN 5,000 cells/mm³). However, the presence of multiple organisms on Gram stain and an extremely high LDH level in the ascitic fluid raised suspicion of a hollow organ perforation. Urgent CT imaging confirmed a perforated peptic ulcer, requiring emergency surgical intervention rather than standard SBP management.

spontaneous_bacterial_peritonitis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: SBP in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal pain and preterm contractions
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old pregnant female (24 weeks gestation) with known cirrhosis due to Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency presented with abdominal pain. Paracentesis confirmed SBP (PMN 380 cells/mm³). She was treated with IV cefotaxime and high-dose albumin under joint obstetric and hepatology care, with successful resolution and continuation of the pregnancy.

spontaneous_bacterial_peritonitis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: SBP in a patient with refractory ascites
  presenting_complaint: Routine paracentesis showing cloudy fluid
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female on the liver transplant waiting list with refractory ascites (requiring weekly taps) presented for her scheduled procedure. The fluid appeared unusually turbid, and analysis confirmed a PMN count of 800 cells/mm³ despite her being entirely asymptomatic. She was admitted for IV antibiotics and started on secondary prophylaxis upon discharge.

spontaneous_bacterial_peritonitis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening SBP with septic shock
  presenting_complaint: Collapse and unresponsiveness
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male with active alcoholic hepatitis was found collapsed at home. In the ED, he was hypotensive (BP 75/40) and tachycardic; paracentesis showed a PMN count of 4,500 cells/mm³. Despite aggressive resuscitation, IV meropenem, and albumin, he developed multi-organ failure and passed away within 24 hours of admission.

spontaneous_bacterial_peritonitis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: SBP with low-protein ascites
  presenting_complaint: Worsening jaundice and mild abdominal discomfort
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female with AIH-related cirrhosis was admitted with a bilirubin of 120 µmol/L. Ascitic fluid protein was very low (<10 g/L), placing her at high risk for SBP, which was confirmed on paracentesis (PMN 320 cells/mm³). She was treated with IV ceftriaxone and subsequently placed on long-term norfloxacin prophylaxis due to the low protein concentration.

spontaneous_bacterial_peritonitis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Fungal peritonitis (SBP mimic)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent abdominal pain after SBP treatment
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male was treated for E. coli SBP with a standard 5-day course of cefotaxime. His symptoms failed to resolve, and a repeat tap showed a rising PMN count and Candida albicans on fungal culture. He was successfully treated with IV fluconazole, identifying this as a case of spontaneous fungal peritonitis in a malnourished, immunocompromised host.
