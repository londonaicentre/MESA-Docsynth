  primary_diagnosis: Strategic infarct dementia
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset apathy and disorientation.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male presented acutely after a small ischaemic stroke involving the left paramedian thalamus.

Neuropsychological testing and MRI suggested a dual pathology of hippocampal atrophy and multiple cortical infarcts. She was prescribed donepezil alongside aggressive management of her cardiovascular risk factors.

  primary_diagnosis: Severe vascular dementia with BPSD
  presenting_complaint: Physical aggression and nocturnal wandering.
  summary_of_course: A 76-year-old male with severe vascular dementia presented with worsening behavioural and psychological symptoms (BPSD). Despite trials of trazodone and environmental modifications, his aggression escalated, requiring a short-term admission to a mental health unit. He was eventually stabilised on low-dose risperidone under close monitoring for cerebrovascular side effects.

  primary_diagnosis: Post-haemorrhagic vascular dementia
  presenting_complaint: Chronic cognitive impairment following intracranial bleed.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female suffered a large hypertensive intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) two years ago. Following rehabilitation, she was left with permanent cognitive deficits, including impaired planning and attention. Her condition is classified as chronic, stable vascular dementia secondary to haemorrhage.

  presenting_complaint: Recurrent focal neurological episodes and cognitive decline.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male presented with multiple lobar microbleeds on MRI (SWI sequence) and episodic confusion. His cognitive profile showed a decline in processing speed and visual-spatial skills. He was diagnosed with CAA-related vascular dementia and advised to avoid antiplatelet therapy due to high haemorrhagic risk.

vascular_dementia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild vascular dementia
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty managing complex finances and mild forgetfulness.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male, still working part-time, noticed errors in his accounting. Outpatient assessment showed mild executive dysfunction and an ACE-III score of 82/100. MRI showed moderate small vessel disease, and he was diagnosed with mild vascular dementia, focusing on lifestyle changes and BP control.

  primary_diagnosis: Vascular dementia with dysphagia
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent chest infections and weight loss.
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old male with advanced vascular dementia was admitted for the third time with aspiration pneumonia. Videofluoroscopy confirmed severe oropharyngeal dysphagia related to pseudobulbar palsy from multiple strokes. After a multidisciplinary meeting, he was placed on a palliative pathway for end-stage dementia.

vascular_dementia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Vascular dementia with Parkinsonism
  presenting_complaint: Slowed movement and cognitive slowing.
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old female presented with a "lower-half" Parkinsonism and significant cognitive impairment. Imaging revealed extensive white matter disease and lacunar infarcts in the basal ganglia, but no dopamine transporter deficit on DaTscan. She was diagnosed with vascular Parkinsonism and associated vascular dementia.

  primary_diagnosis: Vascular dementia post-CABG
  presenting_complaint: Failure to recover cognitive function after cardiac surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old male underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) but experienced prolonged post-operative delirium. Six months later, he remained significantly cognitively impaired with evidence of new embolic infarcts on MRI. He was diagnosed with vascular dementia, likely exacerbated by peri-operative hypoperfusion and emboli.

vascular_dementia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Vascular dementia in CNS vasculitis
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive cognitive decline and headaches.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female presented with subacute cognitive deterioration over four months. Brain biopsy and angiography confirmed primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS). Despite immunosuppressive treatment with cyclophosphamide, she was left with permanent, moderate vascular dementia due to extensive ischaemic damage.

vascular_dementia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Vascular dementia with depression
  presenting_complaint: Low mood, social withdrawal, and memory complaints.
  summary_of_course: A 73-year-old male with a history of ischaemic heart disease presented with what appeared to be "pseudodementia" from depression. However, despite improvement in mood with sertraline, his cognitive deficits persisted and imaging showed significant vascular burden. He was diagnosed with vascular dementia with comorbid depression.

vascular_dementia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: End-stage vascular dementia
  presenting_complaint: Completely dependent for all activities of daily living.
  summary_of_course: An 91-year-old female with a 10-year history of stepwise decline is now bedbound and non-verbal. She has developed stage 4 pressure ulcers and recurrent UTIs. Her care is currently focused on comfort and symptom management within a community hospice framework.

  primary_diagnosis: Vascular dementia, diagnostic challenge
  presenting_complaint: Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) mimic.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male presented with gait apraxia, incontinence, and dementia. While NPH was suspected, high-volume lumbar puncture did not improve symptoms, and MRI showed that the ventriculomegaly was secondary to severe cortical atrophy and white matter ischaemia (hydrocephalus ex vacuo). He was subsequently managed for vascular dementia.

vascular_dementia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Vascular dementia with severe executive dysfunction
  presenting_complaint: Inability to plan meals or follow instructions.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old female with long-standing poorly controlled hypertension presented with profound executive dysfunction but relatively preserved memory. Neuropsychological testing showed severe impairment in frontal lobe tasks. MRI confirmed multiple "silent" cortical infarcts, leading to a diagnosis of moderate vascular dementia.

vascular_dementia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening acute stroke on vascular dementia
  presenting_complaint: Comatose following a massive ischaemic event.
  summary_of_course: An 84-year-old male with pre-existing moderate vascular dementia was admitted with a dense right-sided hemiplegia and reduced GCS (8/15). CT showed a massive left MCA territory infarct. Given his baseline dementia and the severity of the stroke, the family and clinical team agreed on a DNACPR (Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) order and palliative care.
