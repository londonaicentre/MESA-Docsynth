  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis
  presenting_complaint: Mucositis and rapid skin detachment involving the trunk and limbs.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy developed TEN involving 35% BSA shortly after commencing lamotrigine for focal epilepsy. He required nasogastric feeding due to severe oropharyngeal ulceration and specialised ophthalmic care for bilateral symblepharon formation. He was treated with ciclosporin and skin substitutes, eventually making a full cutaneous recovery but requiring long-term eye follow-up.

toxic_epidermal_necrolysis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: SJS/TEN Overlap Syndrome progressing to TEN
  presenting_complaint: Erythematous macules and mucosal erosions evolving into confluent blisters.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female initially presented with 15% BSA involvement (SJS/TEN overlap) which progressed to 45% BSA (TEN) within 48 hours of admission. The causative agent was identified as carbamazepine, and HLA-B*1502 testing was subsequently found to be positive. She was managed with high-dose corticosteroids and biosynthetic dressings, resulting in re-epithelialisation over 25 days.

  primary_diagnosis: Subacute Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis with Ocular Complications
  presenting_complaint: Gritty eyes, photophobia, and skin tenderness with denudation.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female presented with subacute onset of skin peeling (32% BSA) three weeks after starting phenytoin. While her cutaneous lesions responded well to supportive care, she developed severe cicatricial conjunctivitis and corneal ulceration. Long-term management involved amniotic membrane grafting by the ophthalmology team to prevent permanent blindness.

toxic_epidermal_necrolysis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis secondary to Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy
  presenting_complaint: Confluent erythema and skin detachment following immunotherapy.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male undergoing treatment for metastatic melanoma with pembrolizumab developed TEN involving 40% BSA. This rare immune-related adverse event (irAE) was treated with pulsed methylprednisolone and infliximab. Skin biopsy confirmed full-thickness epidermal necrosis, and the patient required a prolonged hospital stay for metabolic stabilisation.

toxic_epidermal_necrolysis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Relapsing-type Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrence of skin sloughing after accidental re-exposure to sulfonamides.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old woman with a previous history of SJS presented with 55% BSA detachment after taking a compound analgesic containing sulfamethoxazole. This "acute-on-chronic" presentation was more severe than her initial episode, requiring immediate ICU admission for haemofiltration. She survived but developed extensive vaginal synechiae and nail dystrophies.

toxic_epidermal_necrolysis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis with Severe Nutritional Depletion
  presenting_complaint: Diffuse skin pain, fever, and inability to swallow.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male developed TEN (42% BSA) after taking ibuprofen for a viral illness. The severe oral and oesophageal involvement led to profound protein-energy malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances. He required total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and aggressive fluid management in a high-dependency unit (HDU) setting for 18 days.

toxic_epidermal_necrolysis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis with Diagnostic Challenge (GvHD Mimic)
  presenting_complaint: Generalized erythroderma and blistering post-bone marrow transplant.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female post-allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant developed 38% BSA skin detachment. Initially suspected to be Grade IV Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD), a skin biopsy confirmed TEN secondary to fluconazole. She was treated with etanercept, which arrested the skin detachment within 72 hours.

toxic_epidermal_necrolysis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Elderly TEN with Co-morbid Heart Failure
  presenting_complaint: Widespread skin erosions and significant peripheral oedema.
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old male with NYHA Class III heart failure developed TEN (33% BSA) due to meloxicam. Fluid resuscitation was extremely challenging due to his fragile fluid balance, leading to transient pulmonary oedema. He was managed with conservative fluid volumes and topical silver nitrate dressings, eventually recovering after a 40-day hospitalisation.

toxic_epidermal_necrolysis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis with Secondary Bacterial Sepsis
  presenting_complaint: Foul-smelling skin discharge and altered mental status.
  summary_of_course: A 47-year-old female with TEN (48% BSA) from phenobarbital developed secondary infection of the denuded areas with MRSA. She progressed to septic shock and required vasopressor support and targeted intravenous antibiotics. After a stormy 5-week course in the burns ICU, she was discharged to a rehabilitation facility for physical therapy.

toxic_epidermal_necrolysis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Early-stage Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis in Community Setting
  presenting_complaint: Influenza-like prodrome followed by painful targetoid lesions and oral ulcers.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male presented to his GP with a 48-hour history of fever and skin pain. Within hours of referral to the emergency department, his BSA involvement increased from 5% to 35%, confirming a diagnosis of TEN. Rapid discontinuation of the culprit drug (lamotrigine) and early transfer to a specialist centre resulted in a favourable outcome.

toxic_epidermal_necrolysis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis with Chronic Respiratory Sequelae
  presenting_complaint: Acute skin sloughing followed by persistent shortness of breath.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female survived an acute episode of TEN (60% BSA) triggered by carbamazepine. During the recovery phase, she developed bronchiolitis obliterans, a rare but severe pulmonary complication of TEN. She now requires long-term domiciliary oxygen and follow-up with respiratory specialists.

toxic_epidermal_necrolysis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis secondary to Mycoplasma pneumoniae
  presenting_complaint: Severe cough and fever followed by total body skin peeling.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old boy presented with atypical pneumonia and subsequently developed 40% BSA skin detachment without a clear drug trigger. Serology confirmed Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection, and he was diagnosed with infection-induced TEN. He responded well to clarithromycin and supportive care in the paediatric ICU.

toxic_epidermal_necrolysis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis
  presenting_complaint: Progressive skin loss despite multiple immunosuppressive therapies.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female with TEN (70% BSA) failed to respond to IVIg and high-dose steroids. Her condition continued to deteriorate with progressive epidermal necrolysis and evolving liver failure. Plasmapheresis was initiated as a rescue therapy, which finally stabilised her skin condition, though she required multiple skin grafts for non-healing areas.

toxic_epidermal_necrolysis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Widespread blistering in the third trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant female (32 weeks gestation) developed TEN (35% BSA) following a course of nitrofurantoin. A multidisciplinary team (obstetrics, dermatology, neonatology) managed her care; an emergency Caesarean section was performed due to fetal distress and maternal metabolic instability. Both mother and neonate survived, though the infant required monitoring for transient skin lesions.

toxic_epidermal_necrolysis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis with Persistent Urogenital Strictures
  presenting_complaint: Painful urination and vaginal bleeding during acute TEN phase.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female experienced TEN (45% BSA) due to sulfasalazine. While the cutaneous lesions healed, the severe erosive vulvovaginitis led to significant scarring and urethral stenosis. She required multiple surgical interventions by urogynaecology over the following year to restore function and manage chronic pain.

toxic_epidermal_necrolysis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis with Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice, right upper quadrant pain, and extensive skin detachment.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male developed TEN (55% BSA) and concomitant hepatitis after starting oxcarbazepine. Laboratory tests showed ALT >1000 U/L and a rising INR. Management was complicated by the need to avoid hepatotoxic medications while providing intensive burn care; he eventually required a 2-month hospital stay.

toxic_epidermal_necrolysis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis in an Elderly Frail Patient
  presenting_complaint: Full-body redness and skin shedding in a residential home resident.
  summary_of_course: An 89-year-old male with advanced dementia and multiple comorbidities developed TEN (80% BSA) after being prescribed allopurinol for asymptomatic hyperuricaemia. Given his extreme frailty and poor prognosis (SCORTEN 6), the clinical team and family agreed on a palliative approach. He was kept comfortable with syringe driver analgesia and died peacefully three days later.
