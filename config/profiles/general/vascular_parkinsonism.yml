vascular_parkinsonism_001:
  primary_diagnosis: "Vascular Parkinsonism"
  presenting_complaint: "Progressive gait instability and short-shuffling steps."
  summary_of_course: "A 78-year-old male with a history of hypertension and Type 2 diabetes presented to the outpatient clinic with a two-year history of 'magnetic' gait. MRI Brain revealed Fazekas grade 3 periventricular leukoaraiosis and multiple old lacunar infarcts in the basal ganglia. He showed no symptomatic improvement after a three-month trial of Levodopa 200mg TDS and was referred for intensive community physiotherapy."

vascular_parkinsonism_002:
  primary_diagnosis: "Acute Vascular Parkinsonism"
  presenting_complaint: "Sudden onset of walking difficulty and urinary urgency."
  summary_of_course: "An 82-year-old female was admitted to the stroke unit following a subacute decline in mobility over 48 hours. Neurological examination showed lower body rigidity and a wide-based gait with preserved arm swing, following a small ischaemic stroke in the internal capsule. She was started on secondary stroke prevention with Clopidogrel and Atorvastatin, showing modest recovery in gait with rehabilitation."

vascular_parkinsonism_003:
  primary_diagnosis: "Vascular Parkinsonism secondary to CADASIL"
  presenting_complaint: "Early-onset gait disturbance and executive dysfunction."
  summary_of_course: "A 65-year-old male with a family history of early-onset dementia presented with a subacute progression of postural instability. Genetic testing confirmed a Notch3 mutation, and MRI showed characteristic anterior temporal lobe white matter changes alongside subcortical ischaemia. His parkinsonian features were refractory to dopaminergic therapy, requiring a multidisciplinary approach to manage his increasing fall risk."

vascular_parkinsonism_004:
  primary_diagnosis: "Severe Vascular Parkinsonism"
  presenting_complaint: "Recurrent falls and total loss of independent mobility."
  summary_of_course: "An 85-year-old male resident in a nursing home presented with severe 'frozen' gait and frequent backward falls. He had a long history of atrial fibrillation and multiple previous TIAs, with neuroimaging showing extensive 'moth-eaten' white matter disease. Despite attempts at pharmacological intervention, he remained non-ambulatory and required a hoist for all transfers."

vascular_parkinsonism_005:
  primary_diagnosis: "Vascular Parkinsonism mimicking Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus"
  presenting_complaint: "Gait apraxia, urinary incontinence, and cognitive slowing."
  summary_of_course: "A 72-year-old female was investigated for the 'Hakim-Adams triad' of symptoms. A lumbar puncture tap test was negative for symptomatic improvement, and high-resolution MRI confirmed the diagnosis of vascular parkinsonism rather than NPH, showing prominent subcortical ischaemic changes. She was managed conservatively with a focus on continence care and gait aids."

vascular_parkinsonism_006:
  primary_diagnosis: "Acute-on-chronic Vascular Parkinsonism"
  presenting_complaint: "Acute confusion and inability to stand following a minor fall."
  summary_of_course: "An 80-year-old male with known mild gait slowing was admitted to the geriatric ward with delirium. CT Brain showed a new acute lacunar infarct in the left thalamus superimposed on chronic small vessel disease. Once the delirium cleared, his parkinsonian gait was significantly worsened, necessitating a transition to a long-term care facility."

vascular_parkinsonism_007:
  primary_diagnosis: "Mild Vascular Parkinsonism"
  presenting_complaint: "Slight slowing of walking speed and difficulty turning."
  summary_of_course: "A 74-year-old female was referred by her GP for a 'shuffling gait' noticed by her family. Examination revealed mild lower limb bradykinesia but normal facial expression and upper limb dexterity. MRI confirmed mild periventricular ischaemia, and she was started on a supervised exercise programme to maintain mobility."

vascular_parkinsonism_008:
  primary_diagnosis: "Post-haemorrhagic Vascular Parkinsonism"
  presenting_complaint: "New onset of bilateral leg stiffness and postural instability."
  summary_of_course: "A 79-year-old male developed parkinsonian gait features six months after a hypertensive thalamic haemorrhage. Clinical assessment showed marked rigidity in the lower limbs with a positive pull test. He showed a partial, 20 percent improvement on the UPDRS motor scale with Co-careldopa, which was continued at a low dose."

vascular_parkinsonism_009:
  primary_diagnosis: "Advanced Vascular Parkinsonism with Aspiration Pneumonia"
  presenting_complaint: "Severe swallowing difficulty and shortness of breath."
  summary_of_course: "An 88-year-old female with advanced vascular parkinsonism was admitted to the ICU with Type 1 respiratory failure. Her history included multiple small vessel strokes and progressive dysphagia, with recent videofluoroscopy showing silent aspiration. Following a multidisciplinary review, she was transitioned to a palliative care pathway focusing on comfort and symptom distress."

vascular_parkinsonism_010:
  primary_diagnosis: "Mixed Parkinsonism (Idiopathic and Vascular)"
  presenting_complaint: "Worsening tremor and gait freezing despite medication."
  summary_of_course: "A 71-year-old male with a five-year history of Parkinson's disease showed a sudden decline in mobility that did not respond to increased Levodopa. DaTscan showed bilateral striatal dopaminergic deficit, while MRI identified new subcortical ischaemic lesions. His management required balancing dopaminergic therapy with aggressive vascular risk factor modification."

vascular_parkinsonism_011:
  primary_diagnosis: "Vascular Parkinsonism with Vascular Dementia"
  presenting_complaint: "Memory loss and a 'stuck to the floor' gait."
  summary_of_course: "A 76-year-old female presented with a stepwise decline in both cognition and mobility. Neuropsychological testing showed a prominent subcortical cognitive profile, and MRI showed extensive leukoaraiosis. She was started on Donepezil for her cognitive symptoms and referred to the falls clinic for gait stabilisation."

vascular_parkinsonism_012:
  primary_diagnosis: "Acute Hemi-Vascular Parkinsonism"
  presenting_complaint: "Sudden onset of right-sided stiffness and dragging of the leg."
  summary_of_course: "An 81-year-old male presented with symptoms mimicking idiopathic Parkinson's but with an acute onset. MRI revealed a focal ischaemic lesion in the left substantia nigra and adjacent midbrain. Unlike typical VP, his symptoms were markedly asymmetrical, but he remained poorly responsive to Levodopa therapy."

vascular_parkinsonism_013:
  primary_diagnosis: "Vascular Parkinsonism with Treatment Failure"
  presenting_complaint: "Persistent gait failure despite high-dose dopaminergic therapy."
  summary_of_course: "A 69-year-old female was titrated up to 1000mg of Levodopa daily and underwent a trial of Apomorphine challenge without significant motor benefit. Her history of heavy smoking and uncontrolled hypertension supported a diagnosis of vascular parkinsonism. Pharmacotherapy was subsequently rationalised to avoid side effects, and the focus shifted to home environmental adaptations."

vascular_parkinsonism_014:
  primary_diagnosis: "Acute-on-chronic Vascular Parkinsonism triggered by Infection"
  presenting_complaint: "Complete loss of mobility and delirium during a urinary tract infection."
  summary_of_course: "An 83-year-old male with pre-existing vascular gait changes was admitted with a UTI and acute functional decline. Despite successful treatment of the infection, his mobility failed to return to baseline, highlighting the fragility of patients with subcortical ischaemia. He required an increase in his social care package to four calls daily."

  presenting_complaint: "Resting tremor in the right hand and slow gait."
  summary_of_course: "A 77-year-old male presented with an atypical resting tremor and a wide-based gait. While initially suspected to have Parkinson’s disease, his DaTscan was normal and MRI showed significant ischaemic changes in the contralateral putamen. He failed to respond to Co-careldopa and was managed with occupational therapy for functional support."

vascular_parkinsonism_017:
  primary_diagnosis: "Severe Vascular Parkinsonism"
  presenting_complaint: "Wheelchair dependency and severe axial rigidity."
  summary_of_course: "A 84-year-old female with a history of multiple strokes presented with severe rigidity primarily affecting the trunk and legs. MRI showed 'Binswanger-type' extensive white matter disease. She was started on Baclofen for symptomatic relief of stiffness and provided with a specialised seating system to prevent pressure sores."

vascular_parkinsonism_018:
  primary_diagnosis: "Mild Vascular Parkinsonism (Diagnostic Challenge)"
  presenting_complaint: "Incidental finding of gait slowing during routine check-up."
  summary_of_course: "A 73-year-old male attending for a hypertension review was noted to have a reduced step height and slowing of gait. He denied any symptoms, but a subsequent MRI Brain requested due to the clinical signs showed significant silent small vessel disease. He was educated on the diagnosis and started on a primary stroke prevention programme."

vascular_parkinsonism_019:
  primary_diagnosis: "Acute Vascular Parkinsonism post-TIA"
  presenting_complaint: "Transient weakness followed by persistent gait difficulty."
  summary_of_course: "An 86-year-old female experienced a TIA with right-sided weakness that resolved within an hour. However, in the following weeks, she developed a persistent, symmetrical shuffling gait and postural instability. Repeat imaging showed a new lacunar infarct in the midbrain, confirming a diagnosis of vascular parkinsonism."

vascular_parkinsonism_020:
  primary_diagnosis: "Moderate Vascular Parkinsonism"
  presenting_complaint: "Difficulty rising from a chair and frequent 'tripping' over small obstacles."
  summary_of_course: "An 80-year-old male presented with moderate lower body parkinsonism and a history of peripheral vascular disease. MRI showed confluent white matter hyperintensities and old infarcts in the globus pallidus. He was enrolled in a multidisciplinary 'Falls and Balance' programme, which resulted in a significant reduction in his monthly fall frequency."
