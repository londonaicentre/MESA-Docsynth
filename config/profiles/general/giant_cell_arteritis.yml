giant_cell_arteritis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Classic Temporal Arteritis
  presenting_complaint: New onset right-sided headache and scalp tenderness.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female presented to her GP with a two-week history of severe right-sided temporal headache and pain when brushing her hair. Blood tests revealed an ESR of 88 mm/hr and CRP of 54 mg/L. She was started on 40mg prednisolone daily, leading to rapid symptom resolution within 48 hours, and a temporal artery biopsy subsequently confirmed transmural inflammation.

giant_cell_arteritis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Arteritic Anterior Ischaemic Optic Neuropathy (AION)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, painless loss of vision in the left eye.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with a history of hypertension presented acutely with a "curtain" falling over his left eye. Clinical examination revealed a pale, swollen optic disc and a positive RAPD, with an ESR of 110 mm/hr. He was admitted for three days of IV methylprednisolone 1g daily followed by high-dose oral steroids, resulting in stabilization of vision but no significant recovery of the left eye.

giant_cell_arteritis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Giant Cell Arteritis with Polymyalgia Rheumatica
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral shoulder girdle pain and jaw claudication.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with known PMR on 5mg prednisolone presented with worsening proximal stiffness and new pain in her jaw while chewing. Investigations showed a CRP rise from 5 to 42 mg/L, and temporal artery ultrasound demonstrated a positive "halo sign" bilaterally. Her steroid dose was increased to 60mg daily with a slow taper, successfully controlling both GCA and PMR symptoms.

giant_cell_arteritis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Large Vessel Giant Cell Arteritis (LV-GCA)
  presenting_complaint: Unexplained fever, night sweats, and limb claudication.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male presented with a three-month history of pyrexia of unknown origin and weight loss. Conventional temporal artery biopsy was negative, but a PET-CT scan revealed intense FDG uptake throughout the thoracic aorta and subclavian arteries. He was diagnosed with large vessel GCA and commenced on prednisolone and tocilizumab to achieve disease remission.

giant_cell_arteritis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: GCA with Normal Inflammatory Markers
  presenting_complaint: Persistent headache and blurred vision despite normal bloods.
  summary_of_course: A 76-year-old female presented with classic cranial GCA symptoms but had an ESR of 12 mm/hr and CRP of 3 mg/L. Despite the normal markers, clinical suspicion remained high, and a temporal artery biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis. She responded well to standard steroid therapy, highlighting the pitfall of relying solely on biochemistry.

giant_cell_arteritis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Scalp Necrosis secondary to GCA
  presenting_complaint: Blackening of the skin over the left temple and severe pain.
  summary_of_course: An 84-year-old male presented with advanced ischaemic scalp necrosis following a week of neglected temporal headaches. This life-threatening presentation required urgent IV steroids and plastic surgery consultation for debridement of necrotic tissue. He remained on long-term anticoagulation and high-dose steroids but suffered permanent scarring and partial vision loss.

giant_cell_arteritis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Relapsing Giant Cell Arteritis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrence of headache during prednisolone tapering.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female, initially diagnosed 6 months prior, experienced a return of temporal pain when her prednisolone dose reached 10mg. Her CRP rose from 2 to 35 mg/L, indicating a clinical relapse. Methotrexate was added as a steroid-sparing agent, allowing for a more successful second attempt at tapering steroids over the following year.

giant_cell_arteritis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: GCA-related Ischaemic Stroke
  presenting_complaint: Right-sided weakness and expressive aphasia.
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old male presented with acute stroke symptoms following a month of untreated "tension headaches." MRI brain showed multiple infarcts, and MRA demonstrated narrowing of the vertebral arteries consistent with vasculitis. He was treated with pulsed methylprednisolone alongside standard stroke care, though he was left with significant neurological deficits.

giant_cell_arteritis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Occult Giant Cell Arteritis
  presenting_complaint: Profound weight loss and normocytic anaemia.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male was investigated for suspected malignancy due to a 10kg weight loss and an Hb of 95 g/L. Extensive imaging for cancer was negative, but a high ESR of 95 mm/hr prompted a temporal artery biopsy which was positive for GCA. His systemic symptoms and anaemia resolved completely within weeks of starting 40mg prednisolone.

giant_cell_arteritis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: GCA with Tongue Ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Severe tongue pain and difficulty speaking.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female presented with a pale, cold, and exquisitely painful tongue. Examination revealed early signs of lingual infarction, and bloods showed a CRP of 120 mg/L. She was treated urgently with IV steroids to prevent full tongue necrosis, a rare but severe complication of GCA-related vasculitis of the lingual artery.

giant_cell_arteritis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Steroid-Resistant Giant Cell Arteritis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent headache and high CRP despite 60mg Prednisolone.
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old male failed to improve clinically or biochemically after two weeks of high-dose oral steroids. Repeat imaging and biopsy confirmed ongoing active vasculitis. He was transitioned to tocilizumab (IL-6 inhibitor) infusions, which finally induced clinical remission and allowed for the reduction of his steroid burden.

giant_cell_arteritis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: GCA in a "Younger" Adult
  presenting_complaint: New-onset migraine-like headaches in a 52-year-old.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female presented with atypical craniofacial pain and elevated inflammatory markers (ESR 60). Given her age, GCA was initially considered unlikely, but a temporal artery ultrasound showed a clear halo sign. She was treated successfully with steroids, representing an edge case of GCA occurring in the lower age limit of the typical demographic.

giant_cell_arteritis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic GCA with Aortic Aneurysm
  presenting_complaint: Tearing chest pain in a patient with known GCA.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with a 3-year history of GCA presented to A&E with acute chest pain. CT Angiogram revealed a 6cm thoracic aortic aneurysm with signs of impending rupture, a late complication of large-vessel involvement. He underwent emergency vascular graft surgery and required intensification of his immunosuppressive therapy.

giant_cell_arteritis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: GCA with Comorbid Diabetes and Osteoporosis
  presenting_complaint: Jaw claudication and blurred vision in a frail patient.
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old female with brittle diabetes and severe osteoporosis required GCA treatment. The high-dose steroids caused immediate hyperglycaemic crisis and a vertebral fragility fracture within weeks. Her management was complex, requiring insulin pump titration, bisphosphonates, and an accelerated switch to tocilizumab to minimize steroid exposure.

giant_cell_arteritis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Biopsy-Negative, Ultrasound-Positive GCA
  presenting_complaint: Classic temporal headache but negative biopsy.
  summary_of_course: A 71-year-old male had a 2cm temporal artery biopsy that showed no evidence of vasculitis (likely a "skip lesion"). However, colour Doppler ultrasound showed persistent "halo" signs in both temporal and axillary arteries. Based on the ACR criteria and imaging, he was treated for GCA with a good clinical response.

giant_cell_arteritis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: GCA presenting as Chronic Cough
  presenting_complaint: Persistent dry cough and malaise.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old female was referred to respiratory clinic for a dry cough of 3 months' duration with normal CXR. Further history revealed mild scalp tenderness and an ESR of 75 mm/hr. GCA was confirmed via biopsy, and the cough—a recognized but rare presentation of GCA—resolved entirely upon starting prednisolone.

giant_cell_arteritis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: GCA with Mesenteric Ischaemia
  presenting_complaint: Post-prandial abdominal pain and weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 73-year-old male with known cranial GCA developed severe abdominal angina. Angiography showed vasculitic narrowing of the superior mesenteric artery. This rare extracranial manifestation required aggressive immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide to prevent bowel infarction, representing a life-threatening systemic variant.

giant_cell_arteritis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: GCA with Auditory Vestibular Symptoms
  presenting_complaint: Sudden hearing loss and vertigo.
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old female presented with acute vestibulocochlear dysfunction and a synchronous temporal headache. Audiometry confirmed sensorineural hearing loss, and inflammatory markers were markedly raised. The diagnosis of GCA was made, and while her headaches improved with steroids, her hearing loss remained permanent due to labyrinthine artery ischaemia.

giant_cell_arteritis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute GCA with Mental Confusion
  presenting_complaint: Cognitive decline and low-grade fever over six weeks.
  summary_of_course: An 81-year-old male was initially investigated for dementia after becoming increasingly confused and lethargic. Blood tests showed an ESR of 105 mm/hr and a CRP of 80 mg/L; a subsequent TAB was positive for GCA. His "pseudodementia" and systemic symptoms resolved completely with steroid treatment, highlighting GCA as a reversible cause of cognitive impairment in the elderly.

giant_cell_arteritis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: GCA with Bilateral Visual Loss (Life-threatening)
  presenting_complaint: Total blindness in both eyes within 24 hours.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old female ignored a mild headache for a month before losing vision in her right eye, followed by the left eye 12 hours later. She was admitted to the ICU for emergency IV methylprednisolone and monitoring of systemic vasculitis. Despite aggressive treatment, she remained permanently blind in both eyes, illustrating the catastrophic consequences of delayed diagnosis.
