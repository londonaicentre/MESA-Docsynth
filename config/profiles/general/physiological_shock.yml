  presenting_complaint: Loss of sensation and movement following a fall
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female sustained a traumatic spinal cord injury at the T3 level after a mountain bike accident. She exhibited the classic triad of hypotension, bradycardia, and warm peripheries due to loss of sympathetic tone. Management focused on MAP augmentation with phenylephrine and spinal stabilisation.

physiological_shock_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Obstructive shock due to pulmonary embolism
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset pleuritic chest pain and syncope
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male, three days post-total hip replacement, collapsed while mobilising. CTPA confirmed a massive saddle pulmonary embolism with evidence of right ventricular strain. Due to persistent hypotension (BP 88/50 mmHg), he was treated with systemic thrombolysis (alteplase) with rapid haemodynamic improvement.

physiological_shock_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypovolaemic shock (dehydration)
  presenting_complaint: Severe vomiting and diarrhoea for 48 hours
  summary_of_course: An 18-month-old female presented with a history of rotavirus gastroenteritis. She was lethargic with a capillary refill time of 4 seconds, sunken fontanelle, and undetectable blood pressure. She required emergency intraosseous access and rapid fluid boluses of 20ml/kg normal saline to restore perfusion.

  primary_diagnosis: Distributive shock (Adrenal crisis)
  presenting_complaint: Profound weakness, abdominal pain, and vomiting
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old male with Addison’s disease developed a viral URTI and failed to implement "sick day" steroid rules. He presented in a shock state resistant to initial fluid resuscitation, with hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia. Diagnosis of adrenal crisis was made, and he responded rapidly to 100mg IV hydrocortisone.

physiological_shock_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Obstructive shock (Tension pneumothorax)
  presenting_complaint: Acute respiratory distress and tracheal deviation
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old tall, thin male smoker presented with sudden onset left-sided chest pain. On arrival, he was cyanosed with absent breath sounds on the left and a BP of 75/40 mmHg. Immediate needle decompression in the second intercostal space, mid-clavicular line, resulted in a "hiss" of air and immediate stabilisation.

physiological_shock_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Septic shock (Neutropenic)
  presenting_complaint: Fever and lethargy following chemotherapy
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female undergoing treatment for breast cancer presented with a temperature of 39.2°C and a neutrophil count of 0.2 x 10^9/L. She quickly became hypotensive and tachypnoeic, requiring ICU admission for aggressive fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem). Blood cultures later grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset lower abdominal pain and fainting
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female was brought to A&E after collapsing at home. She was tachycardic (HR 135) and hypotensive (BP 80/45) with a positive pregnancy test. Bedside ultrasound showed significant free fluid in the pouch of Douglas, and she was rushed to theatre for an emergency salpingectomy.

  presenting_complaint: Palpitations and near-syncope
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with a history of ischaemic heart disease presented in ventricular tachycardia (VT) at a rate of 190 bpm. He was pale and diaphoretic with a systolic BP of 70 mmHg. Following three unsuccessful synchronised DC cardioversions, he was started on an amiodarone infusion and eventually stabilised.

  presenting_complaint: Extensive skin burns following a house fire
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male sustained 45% Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) partial and full-thickness burns. He developed significant burn shock due to massive fluid shifts and increased capillary permeability. He was resuscitated using the Parkland formula, requiring over 12 litres of Hartmann’s solution in the first 24 hours.

  primary_diagnosis: Septic shock (Meningococcal)
  presenting_complaint: Non-blanching purpuric rash and lethargy
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old girl was brought to the ED with a rapid-onset petechial rash and cold extremities. She was severely hypotensive with a prolonged capillary refill time of 5 seconds. Despite aggressive fluid resuscitation and IV ceftriaxone, she developed purpura fulminans and required significant inotropic support.

physiological_shock_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Distributive shock (Vasoplegic syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent hypotension post-cardiopulmonary bypass
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male underwent elective mitral valve replacement. Post-operatively in the CICU, he remained hypotensive despite adequate filling pressures and high-dose noradrenaline. A diagnosis of vasoplegic shock was made, and he showed a dramatic response to a single dose of methylene blue.

  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old male on warfarin for atrial fibrillation presented with generalised weakness. He was found to have a haemoglobin of 52 g/L and a BP of 90/50 mmHg. He was treated with prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and vitamin K, alongside urgent endoscopy which identified a bleeding duodenal ulcer.

physiological_shock_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Cardiogenic shock (Acute myocarditis)
  presenting_complaint: Flu-like symptoms followed by severe dyspnoea
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old previously healthy female presented with signs of heart failure two weeks after a viral illness. Her EF was 15% on echocardiography, and she was in cardiogenic shock with a lactate of 6.0 mmol/L. She was supported with Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) as a bridge to recovery.
