  primary_diagnosis: HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B
  presenting_complaint: Generalised lethargy and mild right upper quadrant discomfort
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female student from South East Asia presented with a six-month history of fatigue. Laboratory tests showed HBsAg positive, HBeAg positive, and HBV DNA >10^7 IU/mL with ALT elevated at 145 U/L.

  presenting_complaint: Screening due to maternal HBsAg positivity
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy, born in the UK to an HBeAg-positive mother, was found to be HBsAg and HBeAg positive. His HBV DNA was extremely high (>10^8 IU/mL), but ALT remained consistently normal (22 U/L). In accordance with current paediatric guidelines, he is managed with regular monitoring rather than active antiviral treatment.

chronic_hepatitis_b_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic hepatitis B in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Antenatal screening at 12 weeks gestation
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old pregnant female was identified as HBsAg positive during routine screening. At 28 weeks, her HBV DNA was 7.5 log10 IU/mL; to reduce the risk of vertical transmission, she was commenced on Tenofovir Disoproxil. The neonate received HBV vaccination and immunoglobulin at birth, and the mother continued treatment postpartum.

  primary_diagnosis: HBV and HIV co-infection
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent respiratory infections and night sweats
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old male newly diagnosed with HIV was also found to be HBsAg positive. His CD4 count was 150 cells/mm³ and HBV DNA was 5,000,000 IU/mL. His antiretroviral regimen was tailored to include Tenofovir and Emtricitabine to treat both viruses simultaneously, achieving dual virological suppression.

chronic_hepatitis_b_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) secondary to HBV
  presenting_complaint: Severe calf pain, hypertension, and livedo reticularis
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented with systemic vasculitis symptoms and new-onset hypertension. Renal angiography showed multiple microaneurysms, and serology confirmed chronic HBV infection (HBeAg positive). He was treated with a combination of plasma exchange, corticosteroids, and Entecavir, leading to resolution of vasculitic lesions.

chronic_hepatitis_b_011:
  primary_diagnosis: HBV-associated membranous nephropathy
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral pitting leg oedema and frothy urine
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female presented with nephrotic-range proteinuria (8g/24h). A renal biopsy confirmed membranous nephropathy, and subsequent screening revealed positive HBsAg with a DNA of 80,000 IU/mL. Initiation of Entecavir led to a reduction in viraemia and a significant improvement in her proteinuria over six months.

chronic_hepatitis_b_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Chemotherapy-induced HBV reactivation
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of jaundice during lymphoma treatment
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female undergoing R-CHOP chemotherapy for B-cell lymphoma developed an ALT flare of 900 U/L. Review of baseline labs showed she was HBsAg negative but anti-HBc positive, and current testing showed HBsAg seroconversion with high HBV DNA. Despite emergency Tenofovir, she developed hepatic failure and succumbed to sepsis.

  primary_diagnosis: Decompensated HBV cirrhosis with ascites
  presenting_complaint: Increasing abdominal girth and breathlessnes
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with known CHB presented with clinical ascites and peripheral oedema. Paracentesis confirmed a sterile transudate (SAAG >11 g/L), and bloods showed a Bilirubin of 55 µmol/L and Albumin of 24 g/L. He was managed with spironolactone, furosemide, and Entecavir, and was subsequently referred for liver transplant assessment.

chronic_hepatitis_b_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Antiviral resistance (YMDD mutation)
  presenting_complaint: Rising viral load despite medication adherence
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male on long-term Lamivudine monotherapy for CHB showed a rebound in HBV DNA from undetectable to 10^5 IU/mL. Genotypic testing confirmed the M204V mutation in the polymerase gene. His treatment was switched to Tenofovir Disoproxil, which successfully restored virological suppression.

  primary_diagnosis: Occult Hepatitis B infection
  presenting_complaint: Evaluation for unexplained mild transaminitis
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with persistent ALT elevations (60-80 U/L) was HBsAg negative but anti-HBc positive. Highly sensitive PCR testing detected HBV DNA at a low level (150 IU/mL). A liver biopsy showed mild chronic hepatitis, and he was started on low-dose Entecavir to prevent progression, given his comorbid Type 2 diabetes.

chronic_hepatitis_b_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic hepatitis B in a patient with CKD
  presenting_complaint: Routine monitoring in renal clinic
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with Stage 4 Chronic Kidney Disease (eGFR 22 mL/min) required treatment for HBeAg-negative CHB. Due to concerns regarding Tenofovir-related nephrotoxicity, he was commenced on Entecavir at a reduced dose of 0.5mg weekly. His HBV DNA became undetectable within six months without further decline in renal function.

  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic liver failure (Alcohol and HBV)
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice and haematemesis
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male with a history of heavy alcohol intake and known CHB presented with variceal bleeding. Investigations showed a MELD score of 28, positive HBsAg, and DNA of 200,000 IU/mL. He was treated with endoscopic banding, intravenous Pabrinex, and Entecavir, requiring a prolonged hospital stay for nutritional support and alcohol withdrawal management.

chronic_hepatitis_b_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-liver transplant HBV recurrence prevention
  presenting_complaint: Post-operative follow-up post-orthotopic liver transplant
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male underwent liver transplantation for HBV-related end-stage liver disease. To prevent graft reinfection, he was maintained on a combination of Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin (HBIG) and Entecavir. Two years post-transplant, he remains HBsAg negative with undetectable HBV DNA and normal graft function.

chronic_hepatitis_b_019:
  primary_diagnosis: HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis (Pre-core mutant)
  presenting_complaint: Fluctuating liver enzymes during annual check-up
  summary_of_course: A 37-year-old female was HBeAg negative but had an HBV DNA of 55,000 IU/mL and ALT fluctuating between 40 and 110 U/L. DNA sequencing identified a G1896A pre-core mutation, explaining the HBeAg-negative phenotype despite active replication. She was commenced on Pegylated Interferon-alpha for 48 weeks, achieving a sustained virological response.

chronic_hepatitis_b_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Fulminant flare of chronic hepatitis B
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressing jaundice and coagulopathy
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male with previously undiagnosed CHB presented with an acute onset of severe icterus and an INR of 2.8. He had no prior history of liver disease but was HBsAg positive with a DNA of 9 log10 IU/mL. He was transferred to a supra-regional liver unit for emergency Entecavir and was listed for a super-urgent liver transplant due to rapidly declining mental status.
