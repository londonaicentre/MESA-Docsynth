ludwigs_angina_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Ludwig's Angina mimicking Angioedema
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset tongue and lip swelling.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female was initially treated in A&E for suspected ACE-inhibitor induced angioedema with adrenaline and antihistamines. Lack of response and the development of pyrexia prompted a CT scan, which revealed a deep space neck infection consistent with Ludwig's Angina. She was subsequently transferred to ENT for IV antibiotics and monitoring.

ludwigs_angina_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Ludwig's Angina (MRSA)
  presenting_complaint: Non-resolving neck swelling and foul-smelling discharge.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male failed to respond to standard IV co-amoxiclav for Ludwig's Angina. Culture of the surgical aspirate identified Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Treatment was escalated to IV vancomycin and linezolid, leading to a slow but successful recovery after secondary wound debridement.

ludwigs_angina_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Ludwig's Angina secondary to Sialadenitis
  presenting_complaint: Painful swelling under the jaw, worse when eating.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old edentulous male presented with Ludwig's Angina originating from an infected submandibular gland (sialadenitis) caused by a sialolith. The infection breached the glandular capsule to involve the sublingual and submandibular spaces. He was treated with IV antibiotics and later underwent a submandibular gland excision once the acute infection resolved.

  primary_diagnosis: Ludwig's Angina following Mandibular Fracture
  presenting_complaint: Swelling and discharge from a previous jaw surgery site.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male presented two weeks post-ORIF for a mandibular fracture with bilateral submandibular swelling and trismus. Imaging confirmed the infection had spread to the sublingual space, meeting criteria for Ludwig's Angina. He required removal of the infected hardware, washout of the spaces, and a six-week course of antibiotics for associated osteomyelitis.

ludwigs_angina_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Ludwig's Angina with necrotising fasciitis
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly spreading black skin discoloration on the neck.
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male with Type 2 diabetes presented with Ludwig's Angina that rapidly progressed to necrotising fasciitis of the neck and upper chest. He required extensive and repeated radical surgical debridement of the cervical fascia and skin. He remained in a medically induced coma on ITU for three weeks but eventually survived with significant scarring.

ludwigs_angina_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Ludwig's Angina following fish bone trauma
  presenting_complaint: Sudden throat pain after eating followed by neck swelling.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old male accidentally ingested a sharp fish bone which perforated the floor of the mouth. Within 48 hours, he developed bilateral submandibular swelling and tongue elevation. Surgical exploration recovered the foreign body from the sublingual space and drained an early abscess, preventing further airway compromise.

ludwigs_angina_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Ludwig's Angina in a patient with dental phobia
  presenting_complaint: Extreme trismus and massive submental swelling.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female with severe dental phobia had avoided the dentist for 15 years despite multiple carious teeth. She presented with a late-stage Ludwig's Angina, with her tongue pushed against the hard palate. Due to the high risk of airway loss, a tracheostomy was performed under local anaesthesia before formal surgical drainage of the neck spaces.

ludwigs_angina_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Ludwig's Angina with pleural effusion
  presenting_complaint: Neck swelling and shortness of breath when lying flat.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male presented with Ludwig's Angina and associated bilateral reactive pleural effusions. The inflammatory response was so systemic that it caused significant exudative fluid accumulation in the chest, complicating his respiratory management. He required IV diuretics alongside standard surgical drainage and antibiotics for the primary neck infection.

ludwigs_angina_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Ludwig's Angina in an elderly patient with Parkinson's
  presenting_complaint: Drooling, muffled speech, and inability to clear secretions.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male with advanced Parkinson's disease presented with floor of mouth swelling and difficulty managing saliva. His underlying dysphagia masked the early symptoms of Ludwig's Angina, leading to a late presentation with significant dehydration and pre-renal uraemia. He was managed with aggressive IV rehydration, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and careful airway monitoring in a high-dependency unit.
