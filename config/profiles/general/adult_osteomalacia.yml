adult_osteomalacia_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Nutritional Vitamin D deficiency osteomalacia
  presenting_complaint: Chronic diffuse bone pain and waddling gait
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old housebound woman presented with a 12-month history of worsening pelvic and lower limb pain. Labs showed 25-hydroxyvitamin D of 12 nmol/L, elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) at 480 U/L, and low urinary calcium. Radiography revealed bilateral symmetrical Looser’s zones in the femoral necks, confirming severe osteomalacia treated with high-dose oral colecalciferol and calcium.

adult_osteomalacia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Malabsorption-associated osteomalacia
  presenting_complaint: Proximal muscle weakness and recurrent fractures
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with undiagnosed Coeliac disease presented with difficulty climbing stairs and a recent rib fracture. Investigations revealed low serum calcium (2.02 mmol/L), low phosphate, and a positive anti-TTG screen. Bone biopsy confirmed impaired mineralisation; symptoms resolved following a gluten-free diet and parenteral vitamin D supplementation.

adult_osteomalacia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Oncogenic osteomalacia
  presenting_complaint: Severe progressive bone pain and height loss
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female presented with subacute, debilitating skeletal pain and multiple vertebral insufficiency fractures. Biochemical screening showed profound hypophosphataemia (0.4 mmol/L) and elevated FGF23 levels. A small mesenchymal tumour was located in the left sinus via octreotide scan; surgical resection led to rapid normalisation of phosphate and clinical recovery.

adult_osteomalacia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Drug-induced osteomalacia (Anticonvulsants)
  presenting_complaint: Generalized aches and low mood
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old man on long-term phenytoin for epilepsy presented to his GP with vague musculoskeletal symptoms initially attributed to depression. Bloods revealed a low-normal calcium and significantly elevated PTH (Secondary Hyperparathyroidism). Diagnosis of osteomalacia due to induced CYP450 metabolism of Vitamin D was made, managed by switching anticonvulsants and Vitamin D loading.

adult_osteomalacia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Tenofovir-induced Fanconi syndrome with osteomalacia
  presenting_complaint: New onset hip pain and polyuria
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old HIV-positive patient on Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF) presented with atraumatic hip pain. Investigations showed hypophosphataemia, glycosuria in the absence of diabetes, and metabolic acidosis. TDF was discontinued due to renal tubular dysfunction causing phosphate wasting and secondary osteomalacia, with subsequent clinical improvement on an alternative antiretroviral regimen.

adult_osteomalacia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-bariatric surgery osteomalacia
  presenting_complaint: Severe limb pain and paraesthesia
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old woman five years post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass presented with chronic leg pain and muscle cramps. Despite taking standard multivitamins, her Vitamin D was 18 nmol/L and PTH was 45 pmol/L. She required high-dose intramuscular ergocalciferol to bypass intestinal malabsorption, leading to a slow resolution of bone pain over six months.

adult_osteomalacia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute hypocalcaemic crisis in osteomalacia
  presenting_complaint: Tetany and carpopedal spasm
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old vegan female presented acutely to A&E with painful muscle spasms and a positive Chvostek sign. Emergency labs showed severe hypocalcaemia (1.65 mmol/L) and undetectable Vitamin D. Following intravenous calcium gluconate, she was diagnosed with acute-on-chronic osteomalacia and started on aggressive oral replacement therapy.

adult_osteomalacia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: X-linked hypophosphataemic osteomalacia (Adult presentation)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic stiffness and lower limb deformity
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male with a history of childhood "rickets" presented with worsening enthesopathy and bone pain. Labs showed persistent hypophosphataemia with inappropriately low 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. He was diagnosed with adult-onset complications of XLH and commenced on phosphate supplements and calcitriol, improving his mobility scores.

adult_osteomalacia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent bone pain and pruritus
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with Stage 5 CKD on haemodialysis presented with diffuse bone pain. Investigations showed high phosphate, very high PTH, and low 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, consistent with the osteomalacic spectrum of renal osteodystrophy. Treatment involved phosphate binders, cinacalcet, and active vitamin D analogues (alfacalcidol).

adult_osteomalacia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Cadmium-induced osteomalacia (Itai-itai disease variant)
  presenting_complaint: Multiple stress fractures and renal stones
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old industrial worker presented with chronic back pain and recurrent nephrolithiasis. Occupational history and urine toxicology revealed chronic cadmium exposure causing proximal tubular damage (Fanconi syndrome). The resulting phosphate wasting led to severe osteomalacia, requiring chelation therapy and intensive mineral replacement.

adult_osteomalacia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild nutritional osteomalacia
  presenting_complaint: Non-specific fatigue and dull ache in lower back
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old office worker with limited sun exposure and a poor diet presented with persistent tiredness. Initial investigations were largely normal except for a borderline low Vitamin D (28 nmol/L) and slightly raised ALP. A diagnosis of mild osteomalacia was suspected; symptoms fully resolved after three months of standard Vitamin D3 supplementation (2000 IU daily).

adult_osteomalacia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Pregnancy-associated osteomalacia
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty walking in the third trimester
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old pregnant woman presented with severe pelvic girdle pain and inability to weight-bear. Initially dismissed as normal pregnancy discomfort, persistent symptoms led to blood tests showing a Vitamin D of 15 nmol/L and high PTH. Post-partum imaging confirmed Looser's zones in the pubic rami; she responded rapidly to therapeutic Vitamin D.

adult_osteomalacia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Aluminium-induced osteomalacia
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive bone pain and fractured ribs
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old long-term dialysis patient presented with severe bone pain and encephalopathy. Bone biopsy with tetracycline labelling showed a total lack of mineralisation and high aluminium staining at the calcification front. The source was identified as aluminium-containing phosphate binders; symptoms improved following cessation and desferrioxamine therapy.

adult_osteomalacia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Osteomalacia secondary to Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC)
  presenting_complaint: Bone pain and jaundice
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female with PBC presented with worsening skeletal pain and a fracture of the distal radius. Malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins due to cholestasis led to profound Vitamin D deficiency. She required monthly Vitamin D injections and oral calcium to maintain bone health despite her progressive liver disease.

adult_osteomalacia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Osteomalacia misdiagnosed as Fibromyalgia
  presenting_complaint: Years of widespread pain and tenderness
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old woman had been treated for fibromyalgia for four years with minimal relief. A new GP checked her bone profile, finding an ALP of 320 U/L and Vitamin D <10 nmol/L. Following a 300,000 IU loading dose of colecalciferol, her "fibromyalgia" symptoms vanished, highlighting osteomalacia as a significant diagnostic mimic.

adult_osteomalacia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypophosphatasia (Adult-onset)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent metatarsal stress fractures
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male presented with chronic foot pain and a history of early primary tooth loss. Laboratory findings showed persistently low ALP levels (15 U/L) and elevated serum pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. Genetic testing confirmed ALPL gene mutation, leading to a diagnosis of adult hypophosphatasia presenting with osteomalacic features.

adult_osteomalacia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe osteomalacia with respiratory failure
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath and chest wall pain
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old malnourished man was admitted to the ICU with hypercapnic respiratory failure. Imaging showed multiple healing rib fractures and severe thoracic kyphosis due to long-standing untreated osteomalacia. Management included non-invasive ventilation and slow correction of profound Vitamin D and phosphate deficiencies.

adult_osteomalacia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Osteomalacia due to total parenteral nutrition (TPN)
  presenting_complaint: New onset bone pain during hospitalisation
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old patient on long-term TPN for short bowel syndrome developed progressive limb pain. Review of the TPN formulation revealed inadequate Vitamin D and excessive aluminium contamination. Adjustment of the micronutrient profile and Vitamin D supplementation resulted in the resolution of symptoms over several months.

adult_osteomalacia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Treatment-resistant osteomalacia (Non-adherence)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent fractures despite prescribed therapy
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male with a history of osteomalacia continued to present with new fractures. Despite repeated prescriptions for high-dose Vitamin D, his levels remained <20 nmol/L. Supervised oral loading in a day-case setting resulted in a rise in Vitamin D levels, confirming that "resistance" was due to medication non-adherence.

adult_osteomalacia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Distal Renal Tubular Acidosis (dRTA) with osteomalacia
  presenting_complaint: Muscle weakness and recurrent kidney stones
  summary_of_course: A 37-year-old woman presented with profound proximal weakness and hypokalaemia. Investigations revealed a hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis and an inability to acidify urine below pH 6.0. The chronic acidosis led to bone mineral buffering, resulting in secondary osteomalacia, which was treated with bicarbonate supplements and Vitamin D.
