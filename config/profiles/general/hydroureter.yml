  primary_diagnosis: Posterior urethral valves (PUV)
  presenting_complaint: Poor urinary stream and palpable abdominal mass in a neonate.
  summary_of_course: A 2-week-old male neonate presented with poor feeding and a weak urinary stream. Ultrasound revealed bilateral severe hydroureter and hydronephrosis with a thickened bladder wall. Following catheterisation and fluid resuscitation, the patient underwent endoscopic valve ablation, resulting in gradual improvement of the bilateral hydroureter.

hydroureter_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute ureteric colic due to distal calculus
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset severe left-sided loin-to-groin pain.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male presented to A&E with excruciating left flank pain and haematuria. A non-contrast CT KUB identified a 6mm stone at the vesicoureteric junction (VUJ) causing acute moderate left hydroureter. The patient underwent successful ureteroscopic lithotripsy and stent insertion, with resolution of the hydroureter on follow-up imaging.

hydroureter_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder
  presenting_complaint: Painless gross haematuria and dull right-sided ache.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male smoker presented with intermittent visible haematuria. Cystoscopy and CT urography revealed a large bladder tumour involving the right ureteric orifice, leading to chronic severe right hydroureter. He was managed with a radical cystoprostatectomy and ileal conduit urinary diversion.

hydroureter_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Physiological hydroureter of pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Mild right-sided flank discomfort at 32 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old primigravida presented with persistent right flank ache. Obstetric ultrasound confirmed a viable foetus and noted mild-to-moderate right-sided hydroureter, likely due to compression by the gravid uterus. The condition was managed conservatively with lateral decubitus positioning, and symptoms resolved spontaneously postpartum.

hydroureter_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic ureteric injury post-hysterectomy
  presenting_complaint: Reduced urine output and rising creatinine 48 hours post-surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female underwent a difficult total abdominal hysterectomy for fibroids. Postoperatively, she developed oliguria and pelvic pain; imaging confirmed an accidental ligation of the left ureter with acute severe left hydroureter. An emergency percutaneous nephrostomy was performed followed by a successful ureteroneocystostomy.

hydroureter_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Urinary Schistosomiasis
  presenting_complaint: Terminal haematuria and dysuria in a migrant from an endemic area.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male originally from Egypt presented with long-standing urinary symptoms. Investigations showed calcifications in the bladder wall and distal ureters, with associated chronic bilateral hydroureter due to fibrotic strictures. He was treated with praziquantel and referred for surgical management of the ureteric strictures.

hydroureter_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Neurogenic bladder secondary to spinal cord injury
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and worsening renal function.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with a history of T10 spinal cord injury presented for routine follow-up. Urodynamic studies showed high-pressure detrusor overactivity, and ultrasound revealed bilateral moderate hydroureter. Management involved escalating anticholinergic therapy and implementing a strict clean intermittent catheterisation (CIC) regimen.

hydroureter_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis (Ormond's disease)
  presenting_complaint: Vague mid-back pain and unexplained weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male presented with constitutional symptoms and a dull lumbar ache. CT imaging demonstrated a soft tissue mass encasing the infrarenal aorta and both ureters, causing subacute bilateral hydroureter. He responded well to a course of high-dose corticosteroids and bilateral ureteric stenting.

hydroureter_009:
  primary_diagnosis: High-grade vesicoureteric reflux (VUR)
  presenting_complaint: Febrile seizure and pyelonephritis in a toddler.
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old female was admitted with high fever and positive urine culture for E. coli. A micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG) confirmed Grade V reflux on the right side, manifesting as a persistent megaureter (severe hydroureter). She underwent a successful Cohen cross-trigonal ureteric reimplantation.

hydroureter_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Advanced cervical carcinoma with ureteric obstruction
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral leg oedema and uraemic symptoms.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female with untreated Stage IV cervical cancer presented with lethargy and anuria. Imaging revealed extensive pelvic lymphadenopathy causing extrinsic compression of both ureters and severe bilateral hydroureter. Palliative bilateral nephrostomies were placed to manage the acute-on-chronic renal failure.

hydroureter_011:
  primary_diagnosis: High-pressure chronic urinary retention due to BPH
  presenting_complaint: Overflow incontinence and palpable bladder to the umbilicus.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with long-standing lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) presented with nocturnal enuresis. Serum creatinine was significantly elevated at 450 µmol/L, and ultrasound showed a massively distended bladder with secondary bilateral hydroureter. Following urethral catheterisation, he experienced a post-obstructive diuresis requiring careful fluid monitoring.

hydroureter_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Ureteric endometriosis
  presenting_complaint: Cyclical right-sided flank pain coinciding with menstruation.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female with a history of dysmenorrhoea presented with episodic right renal colic. MRI pelvis and IVU demonstrated a focal narrowing of the distal right ureter with proximal hydroureter, caused by an endometriotic plaque. The patient underwent laparoscopic excision of the lesion and ureteric anastomosis.

hydroureter_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Pyonephrosis with obstructive uropathy
  presenting_complaint: Rigors, hypotension, and severe right flank tenderness.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male with known nephrolithiasis presented in septic shock. CT confirmed a 1cm obstructing stone in the mid-ureter with associated severe hydroureter and "dirty" fat stranding suggestive of infection. He was managed with emergency percutaneous nephrostomy drainage and intravenous antibiotics for pyonephrosis.

hydroureter_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent ureteric stricture post-ureteroplasty
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent dull ache in the left flank following previous surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male who previously underwent a Boari flap repair for a mid-ureteric stricture presented with returning symptoms. Repeat imaging showed failure of the repair with a chronic moderate hydroureter above the anastomotic site. He was managed with long-term metallic stenting due to the complexity of further reconstructive surgery.

hydroureter_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Extrinsic compression by abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding during routine AAA surveillance.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male under surveillance for a 5.2cm AAA was noted to have a new-onset mild left hydroureter on ultrasound. CT angiography confirmed the aneurysm was displacing and partially compressing the left ureter. Given the findings and aneurysm size, he was scheduled for elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).

hydroureter_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Ectopic ureter
  presenting_complaint: Continuous urinary dribbling despite normal voiding patterns in a child.
  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old female presented with persistent dampness since toilet training. Investigations revealed a duplex kidney system on the left, with the upper pole ureter inserting ectopically into the vagina, causing a persistent, dilated hydroureter. A left upper pole heminephrectomy was performed, resolving the incontinence.

hydroureter_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-renal AKI in the setting of multi-organ failure
  presenting_complaint: Anuria in a patient admitted to ICU with abdominal sepsis.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male in the ICU for faecal peritonitis developed sudden-onset anuria. Bedside ultrasound identified new bilateral severe hydroureter, found to be due to inflammatory adhesions and pelvic phlegmon compressing the ureters. Emergency bilateral nephrostomies were inserted to bypass the obstruction during the acute phase of his illness.

hydroureter_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Non-obstructive hydroureter
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding on CT performed for suspected diverticulitis.
  summary_of_course: A 49-year-old female underwent CT imaging for left iliac fossa pain, which confirmed diverticulitis but also noted a mild distal right hydroureter. Subsequent MAG3 renogram showed symmetrical drainage and no evidence of mechanical obstruction. The finding was deemed clinically insignificant and likely a normal anatomical variant.

hydroureter_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Obstructing ureterocele
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent "dragging" pelvic pain and dysuria.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female presented with recurrent episodes of pelvic discomfort. Cystoscopy revealed a "cobra-head" deformity at the left ureteric orifice consistent with an orthotopic ureterocele, causing intermittent hydroureter. She underwent endoscopic incision of the ureterocele, which successfully decompressed the ureter.

hydroureter_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Radiation-induced ureteric fibrosis
  presenting_complaint: Progressive rise in creatinine three years after pelvic radiotherapy.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male treated for prostate cancer with external beam radiotherapy presented with asymptomatic renal impairment. Imaging showed bilateral distal ureteric narrowing with chronic moderate hydroureter, attributed to late-onset radiation fibrosis. He was managed with regular exchange of bilateral ureteric stents every six months.
