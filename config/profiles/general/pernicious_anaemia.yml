pernicious_anaemia_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Pernicious anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Chronic lethargy and exertional dyspnoea
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old female presented to her GP with a six-month history of worsening fatigue and breathlessness on walking. Blood tests revealed a macrocytic anaemia (Hb 82 g/L, MCV 112 fL) and a serum vitamin B12 level of 95 ng/L. Positive anti-intrinsic factor antibodies confirmed pernicious anaemia, and she commenced lifelong intramuscular hydroxocobalamin injections with rapid symptomatic improvement.

pernicious_anaemia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord secondary to pernicious anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Progressive ataxia and paraesthesia in feet
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male presented with a two-month history of "pins and needles" in his lower limbs and increasing difficulty with balance. Neurological examination showed loss of vibration sense and proprioception with upgoing plantars. Investigations confirmed profound B12 deficiency (40 ng/L) and positive anti-parietal cell antibodies; intensive B12 replacement therapy was initiated to prevent permanent neurological deficit.

pernicious_anaemia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Pernicious anaemia with megaloblastic madness
  presenting_complaint: Acute confusion and visual hallucinations
  summary_of_course: An 81-year-old female was admitted via A&E after developing paranoid delusions and disorientation over three weeks. Initial screening showed a severe macrocytic anaemia (Hb 71 g/L, MCV 118 fL) and hypersegmented neutrophils on the blood film. Diagnosis of pernicious anaemia was made via positive anti-intrinsic factor antibodies, and her psychiatric symptoms resolved significantly following B12 supplementation.

pernicious_anaemia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Pernicious anaemia in a young adult
  presenting_complaint: Persistent fatigue and recurrent mouth ulcers
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female with a background of Graves' disease presented with a year-long history of exhaustion and painful glossitis. Laboratory results showed low B12 (110 ng/L) and macrocytosis despite a normal diet. The presence of anti-intrinsic factor antibodies confirmed an autoimmune aetiology, highlighting the association with other autoimmune endocrinopathies.

pernicious_anaemia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Pernicious anaemia presenting as pancytopenia
  presenting_complaint: Easy bruising and recurrent respiratory infections
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male presented with petechiae and a productive cough. Full blood count showed pancytopenia (Hb 64 g/L, WCC 2.1 x 10^9/L, Plts 45 x 10^9/L), initially raising suspicion of myelodysplastic syndrome. Bone marrow aspirate showed megaloblastic changes, and subsequent testing confirmed pernicious anaemia with a very low B12 level, which was successfully treated with parenteral hydroxocobalamin.

pernicious_anaemia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening pernicious anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Severe dyspnoea and congestive heart failure
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old female was admitted to the ICU with high-output cardiac failure secondary to profound anaemia (Hb 39 g/L). She required cautious top-up blood transfusions and urgent B12 replacement. Investigations confirmed pernicious anaemia, and she was stabilised over ten days with a gradual return of normal haematological parameters.

pernicious_anaemia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Pernicious anaemia with atrophic gastritis
  presenting_complaint: Epigastric discomfort and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male underwent OGD for persistent dyspepsia, which revealed features of extensive atrophic gastritis. Biopsies confirmed the diagnosis, and subsequent blood tests showed macrocytosis and B12 deficiency (130 ng/L) with positive anti-parietal cell antibodies. He was started on B12 injections and placed on a surveillance programme for gastric adenocarcinoma risk.

pernicious_anaemia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute pernicious anaemia with glossitis
  presenting_complaint: Sore, "beefy red" tongue and altered taste
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female presented with a painful, smooth, erythematous tongue and metallic taste. Clinical examination noted Hunter's glossitis, and bloods showed a B12 of 88 ng/L with positive anti-intrinsic factor antibodies. Her oral symptoms resolved within two weeks of starting intramuscular B12 therapy.

pernicious_anaemia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Pernicious anaemia with optic neuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Progressive painless bilateral vision loss
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male presented to ophthalmology with declining central vision and reduced colour perception. After excluding glaucoma and cataracts, a nutritional screen revealed severe B12 deficiency (75 ng/L) and macrocytic anaemia. Diagnosis of pernicious anaemia was confirmed, and aggressive B12 replacement resulted in partial recovery of visual acuity.

pernicious_anaemia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Pernicious anaemia in a Type 1 Diabetic
  presenting_complaint: Unexplained worsening of glycaemic control and lethargy
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus reported increased hypoglycaemic episodes and fatigue. Investigations showed a new macrocytic anaemia and a B12 level of 105 ng/L. Positive anti-intrinsic factor antibodies confirmed pernicious anaemia as part of a polyglandular autoimmune syndrome, requiring lifelong B12 injections alongside his insulin regimen.

pernicious_anaemia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic pernicious anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of macrocytosis on routine screening
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female underwent routine health screening which identified an MCV of 106 fL despite a normal haemoglobin. Further testing revealed a low B12 level (145 ng/L) and positive anti-parietal cell antibodies. Although asymptomatic, she was diagnosed with early-stage pernicious anaemia and commenced on three-monthly hydroxocobalamin injections to prevent future complications.

pernicious_anaemia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Pernicious anaemia with masked iron deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Severe fatigue and restless legs
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female presented with exhaustion and a normal MCV, but low B12 and low ferritin. The normocytic picture was due to combined B12 and iron deficiency; once iron was replaced, the macrocytosis of her underlying pernicious anaemia became evident. Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies were positive, and she required both iron and B12 supplementation.

pernicious_anaemia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Juvenile pernicious anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Failure to thrive and cognitive slowing
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old girl presented with poor growth and declining school performance. Investigations revealed megaloblastic anaemia and very low B12 levels, with positive anti-intrinsic factor antibodies confirmed on repeat testing. This rare paediatric presentation of pernicious anaemia was treated with regular B12 injections, leading to significant improvement in her cognitive function and growth velocity.

pernicious_anaemia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Pernicious anaemia with pseudo-thrombotic microangiopathy
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice and dark urine
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male presented with jaundice, very high LDH (5000 U/L), and schistocytes on the blood film, mimicking TTP. However, the reticulocyte count was low and B12 was undetectable (under 30 ng/L). Diagnosis of pernicious anaemia with ineffective erythropoiesis was made, and he avoided plasma exchange as B12 replacement rapidly corrected the haemolysis-like picture.

pernicious_anaemia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Pernicious anaemia with falls and cognitive decline
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent falls and worsening memory
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old male was brought to the geriatric clinic after several falls and increasing forgetfulness. Examination showed loss of ankle jerks and impaired proprioception. B12 was 82 ng/L and anti-intrinsic factor antibodies were positive; B12 replacement therapy stabilised his gait and prevented further cognitive deterioration.

pernicious_anaemia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Pernicious anaemia with vitiligo
  presenting_complaint: Exertional chest pain and depigmented skin patches
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female with long-standing vitiligo presented with new-onset angina on exertion. ECG was normal, but bloods showed Hb 88 g/L and MCV 115 fL. Low B12 and positive anti-intrinsic factor antibodies confirmed pernicious anaemia; her cardiac symptoms resolved once her anaemia was corrected with hydroxocobalamin.

pernicious_anaemia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Pernicious anaemia with false-normal B12 levels
  presenting_complaint: Severe paraesthesia and gait instability
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female presented with classic neurological symptoms of B12 deficiency but had a "normal" serum B12 of 210 ng/L. Due to high clinical suspicion, methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine were tested and found to be significantly elevated. Positive anti-intrinsic factor antibodies confirmed pernicious anaemia, demonstrating that serum B12 can sometimes be misleadingly normal.

pernicious_anaemia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Pernicious anaemia with acute-on-chronic presentation
  presenting_complaint: Sudden collapse and severe pallor
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with a history of untreated "mild" anaemia collapsed at home. He was found to have a haemoglobin of 52 g/L and severe macrocytosis. Emergency hospital admission confirmed pernicious anaemia with positive antibodies, and he required urgent B12 loading and monitoring for hypokalaemia during the initial recovery phase.

pernicious_anaemia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Pernicious anaemia and Hashimoto's thyroiditis
  presenting_complaint: Weight gain and profound cold intolerance
  summary_of_course: A 46-year-old female was initially diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, but her fatigue persisted despite adequate levothyroxine. Further screening identified a co-existing macrocytic anaemia and B12 deficiency (90 ng/L). Positive anti-intrinsic factor antibodies confirmed pernicious anaemia, illustrating the importance of checking for multiple autoimmune conditions.

pernicious_anaemia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Pernicious anaemia with treatment non-compliance
  presenting_complaint: Recurrence of numbness and fatigue
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female, previously diagnosed with pernicious anaemia, presented with a return of symptoms after stopping her three-monthly injections. She had mistakenly switched to oral B12 supplements, which are ineffective in pernicious anaemia due to lack of intrinsic factor. Her symptoms resolved after resuming intramuscular hydroxocobalamin, and she was counselled on the necessity of parenteral therapy.
