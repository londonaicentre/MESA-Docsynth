huntington_disease_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Early-stage Huntington disease
  presenting_complaint: Mild involuntary movements and irritability
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male presented to the neurology clinic with subtle fidgeting of the hands and increased domestic irritability. Genetic testing confirmed 42 CAG repeats in the HTT gene. He was started on low-dose tetrabenazine for chorea and referred for genetic counselling for his two adult children.

huntington_disease_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Juvenile Huntington disease (Westphal variant)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive stiffness and declining school performance
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old girl presented with a two-year history of bradykinesia, rigidity, and cognitive decline, initially misdiagnosed as juvenile Parkinsonism. Investigation revealed 68 CAG repeats, confirming juvenile HD. Management focused on multidisciplinary support, including physiotherapy and levodopa for symptomatic relief of rigidity.

huntington_disease_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Advanced Huntington disease with aspiration pneumonia
  presenting_complaint: Fever, productive cough, and worsening dysphagia
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with long-standing HD was admitted via A&E with acute respiratory distress and a temperature of 38.9°C. Chest X-ray confirmed right lower lobe consolidation consistent with aspiration pneumonia. He was treated with intravenous antibiotics and underwent a speech and language therapy (SALT) assessment for PEG tube consideration.

huntington_disease_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Huntington disease with major depressive disorder
  presenting_complaint: Suicidal ideation and profound apathy
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female with a known family history of HD presented in a mental health crisis. While motor symptoms were minimal, she exhibited severe depression and planning for self-harm. She was admitted to a psychiatric ward for stabilisation on SSRIs and intensive monitoring, highlighting the high neuropsychiatric burden of early-stage HD.

huntington_disease_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Late-onset Huntington disease
  presenting_complaint: Late-life chorea and mild memory loss
  summary_of_course: A 76-year-old male presented with involuntary facial grimacing and gait instability. Initial differential included senile chorea and tardive dyskinesia, but genetic testing revealed 37 CAG repeats (reduced penetrance range). He remains stable in a community setting with regular geriatric and neurology follow-ups.

huntington_disease_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Pre-manifest Huntington disease
  presenting_complaint: Request for predictive genetic testing
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old asymptomatic male sought genetic testing following his father's diagnosis. Following the UK HD predictive testing protocol, he was found to carry 44 CAG repeats. He was enrolled in a longitudinal observational study and provided with psychological support to manage the impact of the positive result.

huntington_disease_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate-stage Huntington disease with severe weight loss
  presenting_complaint: Significant unintentional weight loss and hyperkinesia
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with established HD presented with a BMI of 16.5 despite a high-calorie diet. The severe chorea was determined to be causing high metabolic demand (hypermetabolism). Her medication was adjusted to include olanzapine to help with both motor control and weight gain.

huntington_disease_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Huntington disease with acute subdural haematoma
  presenting_complaint: Confusion and reduced level of consciousness following a fall
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with moderate HD and frequent falls was brought to the ED after being found on the floor. A CT head revealed a 1cm subdural haematoma with midline shift. He underwent emergency burr-hole evacuation and was subsequently fitted with a protective helmet for future fall prevention.

huntington_disease_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Huntington disease with comorbid Type 2 Diabetes
  presenting_complaint: Poor glycaemic control and worsening chorea
  summary_of_course: A 53-year-old male with HD and T2DM presented with an HbA1c of 84 mmol/mol. Cognitive decline had led to poor medication adherence and erratic eating habits. District nursing was engaged to supervise insulin administration, and chorea management was adjusted to avoid medications that worsen glucose tolerance.

huntington_disease_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Huntington disease with drug-induced Parkinsonism
  presenting_complaint: Severe gait freezing and falls
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with HD experienced a rapid decline in mobility after starting high-dose tetrabenazine for chorea. Clinical examination showed lead-pipe rigidity and a masked facies, indicating drug-induced Parkinsonism. Symptoms improved significantly after tapering the tetrabenazine and switching to deutetrabenazine.

huntington_disease_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Huntington disease with psychosis
  presenting_complaint: Paranoid delusions and aggressive behaviour
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old male with middle-stage HD became increasingly aggressive towards his primary caregiver, believing they were poisoning his food. He was admitted to a secure neuro-behavioural unit. Treatment with risperidone was initiated, which successfully managed the psychosis and provided some benefit for his choreiform movements.

huntington_disease_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Advanced Huntington disease with urosepsis
  presenting_complaint: Acute confusion, rigors, and hypotension
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female in a nursing home with end-stage HD was admitted to the ICU with septic shock. Urine cultures grew E. coli, and she required vasopressor support and IV ceftriaxone. Following recovery, a multidisciplinary meeting was held to discuss advanced care planning and DNACPR status.

huntington_disease_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Huntington disease (de novo mutation)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive chorea with no known family history
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male presented with classic chorea and executive dysfunction. Despite both parents living into their 80s with no neurological issues, genetic testing confirmed HD with 41 repeats. This was identified as a likely de novo expansion from a paternal intermediate allele, illustrating a diagnostic challenge in sporadic presentations.

huntington_disease_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Huntington disease with severe obsessive-compulsive symptoms
  presenting_complaint: Repetitive hand-washing and intrusive thoughts
  summary_of_course: A 36-year-old male in the early stages of HD developed debilitating OCD symptoms that interfered with his employment. Cognitive behavioural therapy was attempted but was limited by his cognitive deficits. He eventually responded well to a combination of high-dose fluoxetine and low-dose quetiapine.

huntington_disease_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Huntington disease with comorbid alcohol dependence
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent head injuries and social neglect
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male with HD and a history of heavy alcohol use presented with frequent ED attendances. The interaction between HD-related impulsivity and alcohol dependence made management difficult. He was eventually placed in a specialist residential facility that could manage both his neurological and addiction-related needs.

huntington_disease_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Huntington disease in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Management of chorea during the second trimester
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old pregnant female with known HD (43 repeats) presented for review of her chorea management. Haloperidol was transitioned to a lower-risk profile medication, and fetal monitoring was intensified. She was supported by a joint neurology and high-risk obstetric team throughout her pregnancy and delivery.

huntington_disease_017:
  primary_diagnosis: End-stage Huntington disease with respiratory failure
  presenting_complaint: Shallow breathing and somnolence
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with a 25-year history of HD was managed at home by a palliative care team. He developed Type 2 respiratory failure due to progressive weakness of the respiratory muscles. In accordance with his previously documented wishes, he was kept comfortable with subcutaneous morphine and midazolam infusions until he passed away peacefully.

huntington_disease_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Huntington disease with severe dysarthria
  presenting_complaint: Total loss of intelligible speech
  summary_of_course: A 49-year-old female with moderate HD became increasingly frustrated due to an inability to communicate. A specialist SALT assessment recommended an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) device. While cognitive decline made complex devices difficult, a simplified picture-based system improved her quality of life and reduced frustration-related outbursts.

huntington_disease_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Huntington disease presenting with personality change
  presenting_complaint: Loss of empathy and social disinhibition
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old male was referred by his GP after losing his job due to inappropriate comments to colleagues. There were no motor signs on initial examination, but a family history of "early dementia" prompted genetic testing. The results showed 45 CAG repeats, identifying the personality change as the prodromal phase of HD.

huntington_disease_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Huntington disease with chronic pressure ulcers
  presenting_complaint: Non-healing sacral wound
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old bedbound male with advanced HD and severe chorea presented with a Grade 4 sacral pressure ulcer. Constant movement from chorea made wound healing and dressing retention extremely difficult. He required a high-specification air mattress, intensive tissue viability nursing, and increased sedation to reduce the friction caused by his involuntary movements.
