ventricular_ectopics_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Benign ventricular ectopics
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent heart "skipping" and palpitations
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female medical student presented with a 3-month history of palpitations during rest. 24-hour Holter monitoring showed a 1% burden of monomorphic ventricular ectopics with no complex features. She was reassured, advised to reduce caffeine intake, and discharged from the cardiology clinic without medication.

ventricular_ectopics_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Frequent ventricular ectopy post-myocardial infarction
  presenting_complaint: Occasional chest thumping and lightheadedness
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male with a previous STEMI presented for routine follow-up. ECG revealed frequent unifocal ventricular ectopics; a subsequent Holter monitor demonstrated a 12% burden and several couplets. He was started on Bisoprolol 5mg daily, which significantly reduced symptoms and suppressed the ectopy on repeat monitoring.

ventricular_ectopics_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Ventricular bigeminy secondary to hypokalaemia
  presenting_complaint: Profound lethargy and irregular pulse
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female on long-term Furosemide for heart failure was admitted with generalised weakness. Admission ECG showed persistent ventricular bigeminy, and bloods revealed a potassium level of 2.8 mmol/L. Following intravenous potassium replacement, the bigeminy resolved completely within 12 hours.

ventricular_ectopics_004:
  primary_diagnosis: PVC-induced cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Progressive dyspnoea on exertion and ankle swelling
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented with a 6-month history of worsening heart failure symptoms. Investigations revealed a dilated left ventricle with an EF of 35% and a 24-hour ectopic burden of 28%. Following successful radiofrequency catheter ablation of the ectopic focus in the RVOT, his ventricular function normalised over the following year.

ventricular_ectopics_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Exercise-induced ventricular ectopics
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations specifically during high-intensity running
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old elite rower reported "thumping" in his chest during peak exertion. Exercise tolerance testing demonstrated increasing frequency of ventricular ectopics at high workloads, including a brief run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). Cardiac MRI was performed to exclude arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, which was fortunately negative.

ventricular_ectopics_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Gestational ventricular ectopy
  presenting_complaint: Fluttering sensation in chest in the third trimester
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female, 32 weeks pregnant, reported frequent palpitations. ECG showed occasional ventricular ectopics but no other abnormalities; echocardiography was normal. Symptoms were managed conservatively with reassurance, and the ectopy resolved spontaneously two weeks postpartum.

ventricular_ectopics_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Multifocal ventricular ectopics in Digoxin toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Nausea, blurred vision, and "skipped beats"
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with atrial fibrillation presented with gastrointestinal upset and yellow-tinted vision. ECG showed a slow ventricular response with frequent multifocal ventricular ectopics and occasional trigeminy. His Digoxin level was found to be 3.4 ng/mL; the drug was omitted, and ectopy subsided as levels normalised.

ventricular_ectopics_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic paediatric ventricular ectopy
  presenting_complaint: Incidental irregular heart rhythm noted during pre-operative assessment
  summary_of_course: An asymptomatic 7-year-old boy was referred after an irregular pulse was noted prior to tonsillectomy. ECG confirmed frequent monomorphic ventricular ectopics. After a normal echocardiogram and a 24-hour Holter showing a low burden (<5%) that suppressed with exercise, he was cleared for surgery with no further treatment required.

ventricular_ectopics_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Ventricular ectopy associated with Cardiac Sarcoidosis
  presenting_complaint: Syncope and frequent palpitations
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female with known pulmonary sarcoidosis presented following a collapse. Telemetry showed high-grade ventricular ectopy and episodes of NSVT. Cardiac MRI demonstrated late gadolinium enhancement in the basal septum, and she was subsequently managed with immunosuppression and an ICD for secondary prevention.

ventricular_ectopics_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening R-on-T ventricular ectopy
  presenting_complaint: Sudden cardiac arrest
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with severe ischaemic cardiomyopathy suffered an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Review of his previous week's ambulatory monitoring showed frequent ventricular ectopics exhibiting the R-on-T phenomenon, which eventually triggered ventricular fibrillation. He was successfully resuscitated and underwent urgent ICD implantation.

ventricular_ectopics_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Stimulant-induced ventricular ectopics
  presenting_complaint: Racing heart and anxiety after energy drink consumption
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department after consuming four high-caffeine energy drinks. ECG demonstrated frequent unifocal ventricular ectopics and sinus tachycardia. He was monitored for 4 hours, during which time the ectopy resolved as the stimulant effects wore off; he was advised on lifestyle modification.

ventricular_ectopics_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory ventricular ectopy requiring Flecainide
  presenting_complaint: Persistent, highly symptomatic palpitations
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old female with a 15% ectopic burden remained severely symptomatic despite maximal doses of Bisoprolol and Verapamil. Structural heart disease was excluded via echocardiography and stress test. She was commenced on Flecainide 50mg BD, which resulted in near-complete suppression of the ectopy and symptomatic relief.

ventricular_ectopics_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Nocturnal ventricular ectopy in Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA)
  presenting_complaint: Waking up with a "racing heart" and daytime somnolence
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old obese male underwent a sleep study and Holter monitoring concurrently. The Holter revealed frequent ventricular ectopics occurring almost exclusively during periods of desaturation and apnoea at night. Treatment with CPAP significantly reduced the nocturnal ectopic burden and improved his sleep quality.

ventricular_ectopics_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Ventricular ectopy in Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP)
  presenting_complaint: Atypical chest pain and palpitations
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female with known mild mitral valve prolapse presented with frequent "thumping" sensations. Holter monitoring showed frequent ventricular ectopics, some originating from the papillary muscles. She was started on a low-dose beta-blocker, which provided moderate symptomatic improvement.

ventricular_ectopics_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic ventricular ectopy during COPD exacerbation
  presenting_complaint: Increased breathlessness and irregular pulse
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with severe COPD was admitted with an infective exacerbation. His baseline occasional ectopy became frequent ventricular trigeminy during the acute illness, likely exacerbated by hypoxia and frequent Salbutamol nebulisers. The ectopy frequency returned to baseline once his respiratory status stabilised and nebuliser frequency was reduced.

ventricular_ectopics_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Cocaine-induced ventricular ectopy
  presenting_complaint: Chest pain and palpitations following substance use
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old male presented to A&E after using cocaine intranasally. ECG showed sinus tachycardia with frequent, multifocal ventricular ectopics. He was treated with intravenous Diazepam to reduce sympathetic outflow, leading to a gradual reduction in ectopic frequency over several hours of observation.

ventricular_ectopics_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Ventricular ectopy secondary to hyperthyroidism
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss, heat intolerance, and palpitations
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old female presented with symptoms of thyrotoxicosis. ECG showed frequent ventricular ectopics and a suppressed TSH of <0.01 mIU/L. Treatment with Carbimazole and Propranolol was initiated, and the ventricular ectopy resolved entirely once she reached a euthyroid state.

ventricular_ectopics_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-operative ventricular ectopy in ICU
  presenting_complaint: Frequent ectopy noted on cardiac monitor post-CABG
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male, 12 hours post-coronary artery bypass grafting, developed frequent ventricular ectopics. Electrolyte screening showed a magnesium level of 0.62 mmol/L. Following an infusion of 2g Magnesium Sulphate, the ectopy frequency diminished significantly, and he remained haemodynamically stable.

ventricular_ectopics_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic high-burden ventricular ectopy
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding on routine ECG for insurance
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old male was found to have frequent ventricular ectopics on a routine ECG. Despite a 24-hour burden of 18%, he remained entirely asymptomatic and had a normal echocardiogram for his age. Given his age and lack of symptoms, a conservative "watch and wait" approach was adopted.

ventricular_ectopics_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Ventricular ectopy masking as diagnostic challenge
  presenting_complaint: Dizziness and near-syncope
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male presented with episodes of near-collapse. Initial ECGs showed only occasional ectopy, but prolonged 7-day monitoring revealed that his symptoms coincided with "R-on-T" ectopics triggering short, self-terminating bursts of polymorphic VT. He was referred for urgent electrophysiology studies and subsequent ICD placement.
