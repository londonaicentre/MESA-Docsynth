flail_chest_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute traumatic flail chest
  presenting_complaint: Severe right-sided chest pain and shortness of breath following a high-speed road traffic accident.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male presented to A&E with paradoxical chest wall movement and respiratory distress. CT trauma series confirmed fractures of ribs 4-8 in two places with an underlying pulmonary contusion. He was admitted to the ICU for thoracic epidural analgesia and invasive mechanical ventilation due to worsening hypoxia.

flail_chest_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Flail chest with associated tension pneumothorax
  presenting_complaint: Acute respiratory failure and tracheal deviation after a fall from a height of 4 metres.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old construction worker presented with a visible flail segment on the left and absent breath sounds. Immediate needle decompression was performed followed by a large-bore chest drain for a tension pneumothorax. He underwent surgical rib fixation (ORIF) on day 3 to stabilise the chest wall and facilitate weaning from the ventilator.

flail_chest_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate flail chest in an elderly patient
  presenting_complaint: Pleuritic chest pain and inability to clear secretions following a fall at home.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with known osteoporosis presented with a localised flail segment involving ribs 3-5 on the right. Despite initial stability, she developed Type 2 respiratory failure due to poor cough effort and pain-induced splinting. She was managed with high-flow nasal oxygen and a paravertebral block, successfully avoiding intubation.

flail_chest_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Bilateral flail chest
  presenting_complaint: Crushing chest pain and cyanosis following a heavy machinery accident.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male sustained a severe crush injury resulting in bilateral anterior flail segments and a sternal fracture. Initial ABGs showed profound hypercapnia and acidosis (pH 7.15, pCO2 9.2 kPa). He required emergency bilateral chest drains and prolonged ICU stay with oscillatory ventilation for severe lung contusions.

flail_chest_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric flail chest
  presenting_complaint: Rapid, shallow breathing and bruising over the left rib cage after a bicycle collision.
  summary_of_course: A 9-year-old boy presented with significant chest wall tenderness and paradoxical motion despite the high compliance of paediatric ribs. CT confirmed multiple segmental rib fractures and a large haemothorax. He was managed conservatively with aggressive intravenous analgesia and chest physiotherapy in a high-dependency unit.

flail_chest_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute flail chest presentation
  presenting_complaint: Increasing breathlessness and "clicking" sensation in the chest 48 hours after a rugby injury.
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old male initially dismissed his injury as simple rib bruising but returned with worsening pain and dyspnoea. Clinical examination revealed a previously missed flail segment of the lateral chest wall. He was admitted for observation and managed with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and incentive spirometry.

flail_chest_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Flail chest with massive haemothorax
  presenting_complaint: Haemorrhagic shock and chest wall instability following a motorcycle crash.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female presented with a BP of 80/40 mmHg and a flail chest on the right. An intercostal drain immediately evacuated 1500ml of blood, necessitating an emergency thoracotomy. The flail segment was stabilised internally during the procedure to control bleeding from the intercostal arteries.

flail_chest_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Flail chest complicated by Hospital Acquired Pneumonia (HAP)
  presenting_complaint: Fever, productive cough, and worsening hypoxia five days post-trauma.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with a flail chest from a fall was initially managed on a surgical ward. Due to inadequate pain control and poor mobilisation, he developed a severe HAP in the lung underlying the flail segment. He required transfer to ICU for CPAP support and intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam.

flail_chest_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic flail chest with non-union
  presenting_complaint: Persistent chest wall deformity and chronic pain six months after a traumatic injury.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented with a visible sink-in of the chest wall during inspiration and a palpable "click" on movement. Imaging confirmed non-union of rib fractures 5-8 with persistent paradoxical movement. He was referred for elective rib plating and reconstruction to improve his restrictive lung defect.

flail_chest_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Flail chest masked by morbid obesity
  presenting_complaint: Severe dyspnoea and chest pain following a low-speed RTA.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male (BMI 46) had a normal initial physical exam, but CT thorax revealed a segmental flail injury of ribs 4-7. His clinical condition deteriorated rapidly due to the high work of breathing associated with his habitus and chest wall instability. He required early intubation and a tracheostomy for prolonged ventilatory weaning.

flail_chest_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic respiratory failure with flail chest
  presenting_complaint: Exacerbation of breathlessness and chest wall pain after falling against a bathtub.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with severe COPD sustained a flail segment on the left. His baseline FEV1 was 35% predicted, making him extremely intolerant of the chest wall instability. He was managed with BiPAP and a continuous intercostal nerve block to prevent further respiratory decline.

flail_chest_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Flail chest with diaphragmatic rupture
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal pain and respiratory distress following a fall from a ladder.
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old female presented with a flail chest and bowel sounds heard on chest auscultation. CT confirmed a left-sided flail segment and a concomitant diaphragmatic rupture with gastric herniation. She underwent urgent laparotomy for diaphragmatic repair and concurrent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for rib stabilisation.

flail_chest_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild flail chest managed in the community
  presenting_complaint: Localised chest pain and mild breathlessness after a fall.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with a small lateral flail segment was assessed in the Minor Injuries Unit. He was hemodynamically stable with normal oxygen saturations and no contusions on CT. He was discharged with a robust analgesia plan, including regular paracetamol, ibuprofen, and dihydrocodeine, with daily community nursing follow-up.

flail_chest_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Flail chest with surgical site infection post-ORIF
  presenting_complaint: Redness, discharge, and fever two weeks after rib plating surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male had undergone successful rib fixation for a severe flail chest. He represented with a purulent discharge from the surgical wound and elevated CRP. He required wound debridement and a long course of antibiotics, though the rib hardware was successfully salvaged.

flail_chest_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening flail chest with cardiac contusion
  presenting_complaint: Chest pain, arrhythmia, and hypotension following a steering wheel impact.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female presented with an anterior flail chest and ECG changes suggestive of myocardial injury. Echocardiogram showed a right ventricular contusion and reduced ejection fraction. She was managed in the cardiac ICU with careful fluid titration, inotropic support, and mechanical stabilisation of the flail segment.

flail_chest_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Flail chest in a patient with ankylosing spondylitis
  presenting_complaint: Extreme pain and inability to expand the chest following a minor fall.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with a "bamboo spine" sustained multiple rib fractures creating a flail segment. Due to his pre-existing restrictive lung disease and rigid chest wall, the flail segment caused disproportionate respiratory compromise. He required an early thoracic epidural and intensive chest physiotherapy to prevent atelectasis.

flail_chest_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic flail chest post-resuscitation
  presenting_complaint: Paradoxical chest movement noted after successful ROSC following cardiac arrest.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male received prolonged CPR for a myocardial infarction, resulting in multiple bilateral rib and sternal fractures. Post-resuscitation, he was difficult to ventilate due to chest wall instability. He was managed with internal splinting via positive pressure ventilation in the ICU.

flail_chest_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Flail chest with persistent air leak
  presenting_complaint: Bubbling in the chest drain bottle and failure of the lung to re-expand.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male with a flail chest and pneumothorax had a persistent large air leak through his intercostal drain for 7 days. Bronchoscopy ruled out major airway injury, suggesting the leak was from a lung laceration caused by a sharp rib fragment. He underwent rib fixation and pleurodesis to resolve the leak.

flail_chest_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Flail chest in a patient with liver cirrhosis
  presenting_complaint: Chest pain and worsening ascites following a fall.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with Child-Pugh B cirrhosis sustained a flail chest. His management was complicated by coagulopathy (INR 1.9) and thrombocytopenia, making regional anaesthesia (epidural) contraindicated. He was managed with a lidocaine infusion and cautious pleural drainage to avoid triggering hepatorenal syndrome.

flail_chest_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Flail chest with delayed pulmonary haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of haemoptysis and collapse 24 hours after admission for chest trauma.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female was initially stable with a flail segment and minor contusions. She suffered a sudden, massive pulmonary haemorrhage likely from a rib fragment lacerating the lung parenchyma during a coughing fit. She required emergency lobectomy and rib stabilisation to survive the event.
