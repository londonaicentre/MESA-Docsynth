  presenting_complaint: Chronic, gnawing pain in the rhomboid region with "knots" in the muscle.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female with fibromyalgia reported persistent left-sided thoracic pain. Examination identified multiple hyperirritable trigger points within the trapezius and rhomboid muscles that reproduced her referred pain. Treatment involved a multidisciplinary approach including dry needling, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), and aerobic conditioning.

  primary_diagnosis: Paget's disease of bone
  presenting_complaint: Deep, boring ache in the mid-thoracic region, worse at rest.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male was investigated for an incidentally raised alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 450 U/L. X-rays of the spine showed cortical thickening and trabecular coarsening of the T10 vertebra. He responded well to a single infusion of zoledronic acid, which normalized his ALP and significantly reduced his bone pain.

  primary_diagnosis: T4 syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Upper thoracic pain associated with "glove-like" paraesthesia in both hands.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female presented with vague interscapular pain and nocturnal numbness in all fingers of both hands. Neurological examination and nerve conduction studies were normal, but manual provocation of the T4 segment reproduced her symptoms. Diagnosis was made clinically, and she recovered following a course of thoracic spinal mobilisations and postural retraining.
