motor_neuron_disease_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive right-sided weakness and "tripping over" when walking.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented with a 6-month history of right foot drop and muscle twitching. Neurological examination revealed mixed upper and lower motor neuron signs in three limbs. Electromyography (EMG) confirmed widespread denervation and reinnervation changes, leading to an ALS diagnosis. He was commenced on Riluzole and referred to the multidisciplinary MND clinic for orthotic support.

motor_neuron_disease_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Bulbar Onset Motor Neuron Disease
  presenting_complaint: Slurred speech and difficulty swallowing liquids.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female presented with progressive dysarthria and choking episodes over 4 months. Examination showed tongue fasciculations and wasting with a brisk jaw jerk. Videofluoroscopy confirmed significant aspiration risk, and a Radiologically Inserted Gastrostomy (RIG) was performed for nutritional support. Her condition is managed palliatively with focus on secretion control using hyoscine patches.

motor_neuron_disease_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Respiratory Onset Motor Neuron Disease
  presenting_complaint: Severe orthopnoea and morning headaches.
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male presented acutely to the emergency department with Type 2 respiratory failure. Despite no prior limb weakness, formal respiratory muscle testing showed a Vital Capacity (VC) of 40% predicted when supine. EMG demonstrated subclinical denervation in the thoracic paraspinal muscles. He was stabilised on nocturnal Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) and diagnosed with respiratory-variant MND.

motor_neuron_disease_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic stiffness in both legs and slow, heavy gait.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female reported a 5-year history of progressive leg spasticity and balance issues. Clinical findings showed pure upper motor neuron (UMN) signs with no evidence of muscle wasting or fasciculations. Extensive neuroimaging and CSF analysis ruled out hereditary spastic paraplegia and MS. She remains stable with slow progression, managed with Baclofen and regular physiotherapy.

motor_neuron_disease_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Progressive Muscular Atrophy (PMA)
  presenting_complaint: Wasting of the small muscles of the hands and loss of grip strength.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male presented with bilateral hand weakness and visible muscle rippling. Examination revealed pure lower motor neuron (LMN) signs with absent reflexes in the upper limbs but preserved reflexes in the legs. EMG showed active denervation in multiple segments without UMN involvement. He was diagnosed with PMA, a less common MND variant, and started on Riluzole.

motor_neuron_disease_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Spinal Bulbar Muscular Atrophy (Kennedy's Disease)
  presenting_complaint: Proximal muscle weakness, cramps, and enlarged breast tissue.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented with a long history of leg cramps and difficulty climbing stairs. Clinical examination noted gynaecomastia and perioral fasciculations. Genetic testing confirmed a CAG repeat expansion in the androgen receptor gene. Unlike ALS, this X-linked condition has a slower progression, and he is managed symptomatically in a specialised neurogenetics clinic.

motor_neuron_disease_007:
  primary_diagnosis: MND with Frontotemporal Dementia (MND-FTD)
  presenting_complaint: Personality changes followed by weakness in the left arm.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female was initially referred to psychiatry for apathy and disinhibition. Within 6 months, she developed limb-onset MND symptoms including wasting of the thenar eminence. Neuropsychological testing and MRI brain (showing frontal lobe atrophy) confirmed the MND-FTD overlap syndrome. Management is complex due to the patient's lack of insight into her physical decline and poor compliance with NIV.

motor_neuron_disease_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 1
  presenting_complaint: Severe hypotonia and "floppy" appearance in a 4-month-old infant.
  summary_of_course: An infant presented with a weak cry, poor head control, and a bell-shaped chest deformity. Clinical examination showed absent deep tendon reflexes and tongue fasciculations. Genetic testing confirmed a homozygous deletion in the SMN1 gene. The patient was started on Nusinersen (Spinraza) via intrathecal injection, showing modest improvements in motor milestones.

motor_neuron_disease_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 3 (Kugelberg-Welander)
  presenting_complaint: Frequent falls and difficulty rising from a chair in an adolescent.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old male presented with progressive proximal muscle weakness and a waddling gait. He had achieved all early motor milestones but began struggling with PE at school. EMG and genetic testing confirmed SMA Type 3. He remains ambulatory but requires a manual wheelchair for long distances and undergoes regular monitoring for scoliosis.

motor_neuron_disease_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Flail Arm Variant MND
  presenting_complaint: Symmetrical profound wasting of both upper limbs.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male presented with "dangling" arms but preserved walking ability. Examination showed severe atrophy of the proximal and distal upper limb muscles with absent reflexes, while lower limb function and bulbar muscles remained normal. This "Man-in-the-barrel" presentation represents a regional variant of MND. Over two years, the disease has remained largely confined to the upper limbs, though prognosis remains guarded.

motor_neuron_disease_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Flail Leg Variant MND (Pseudopolyneuritic variant)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive weakness starting in the right foot, spreading to the left.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male presented with what was initially thought to be a peroneal nerve palsy. Over 12 months, the weakness became bilateral and proximal, with associated fasciculations and brisk knee reflexes. EMG showed widespread LMN involvement. This flail leg variant typically has a slightly more protracted course than classic ALS but eventually involves other regions.

motor_neuron_disease_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Acute-on-Chronic)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of breathlessness and cough.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old patient with known moderate ALS was admitted with community-acquired pneumonia. The acute infection precipitated Type 2 respiratory failure, requiring ICU admission for NIV titration. Despite antibiotic therapy, his underlying frailty and MND progression led to a transition to a palliative care pathway. He was discharged to a hospice for end-of-life care.

motor_neuron_disease_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Monomelic Amyotrophy (Hirayama Disease)
  presenting_complaint: Wasting of the right hand and forearm in a young adult.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male presented with insidious, unilateral muscle atrophy of the right hand. Unlike ALS, there were no sensory deficits or UMN signs. Flexion MRI of the cervical spine showed anterior displacement of the posterior dural wall, characteristic of Hirayama disease. The condition stabilised after two years, and he was managed with a cervical collar to prevent further cord compression.

motor_neuron_disease_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Diagnostic Challenge)
  presenting_complaint: Neck pain and progressive hand weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male was initially treated for cervical spondylotic myelopathy and underwent decompressive surgery. When his hand weakness continued to worsen and spread to his legs post-operatively, a repeat EMG was performed. The findings of widespread denervation outside the surgical site confirmed ALS. This case highlights the common pitfall of attributing MND symptoms to degenerative spinal disease.

motor_neuron_disease_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis with Sialorrhoea
  presenting_complaint: Constant drooling and skin irritation around the mouth.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with established bulbar ALS suffered from severe, treatment-resistant sialorrhoea. Initial trials of glycopyrrolate and hyoscine were ineffective or caused excessive dry mouth and confusion. He was successfully treated with ultrasound-guided Botulinum toxin B injections into the parotid and submandibular glands. This significantly improved his quality of life and reduced the risk of aspiration pneumonia.

motor_neuron_disease_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Riluzole Intolerance)
  presenting_complaint: Nausea and jaundice two months after starting MND medication.
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old female with limb-onset ALS was started on Riluzole 50mg BD. Routine blood monitoring at eight weeks revealed ALT levels five times the upper limit of normal. Riluzole was immediately discontinued, and LFTs returned to baseline within a month. Due to the hepatic sensitivity, she continues with supportive care alone, focusing on physiotherapy and occupational therapy.

motor_neuron_disease_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Rapidly Progressive)
  presenting_complaint: Rapid loss of mobility and speech over three months.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male presented with a very aggressive form of ALS. Within 12 weeks of his first symptom (a weak thumb), he became wheelchair-bound and developed significant dysarthria. Genetic screening revealed a SOD1 mutation (A4V), known for rapid progression. He was fast-tracked for NIV and gastrostomy, but sadly succumbed to respiratory failure within six months of diagnosis.

motor_neuron_disease_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis with Multiple Comorbidities
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty using a walking frame due to new arm weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old male with a history of heart failure (EF 30%) and Type 2 diabetes presented with progressive upper limb wasting. The clinical picture was complicated by peripheral neuropathy from diabetes and exertional dyspnoea from heart failure. EMG was essential to differentiate MND from diabetic amyotrophy. He is managed with a low-dose ACE inhibitor and cautious Riluzole use, requiring close monitoring of renal function.

motor_neuron_disease_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Late-Stage Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Total loss of movement except for eye muscles (Locked-in state).
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old female has been living with ALS for seven years. She is now completely tetraplegic and dependent on a tracheostomy with long-term ventilation. Communication is achieved solely through an eye-gaze computer system. She receives 24-hour nursing care at home, focusing on skin integrity, bowel management, and preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia.

motor_neuron_disease_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Rural Community Care)
  presenting_complaint: Increasing difficulty with activities of daily living in a remote setting.
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old farmer in a rural area presented with limb-onset MND. Due to the distance from a tertiary neurosciences centre, his care was coordinated via telehealth with the local GP and community matron. Home adaptations and a stairlift were installed early to maintain independence. His progress is monitored through a "shared care" model, ensuring access to specialised MND nurses despite his geographical isolation.
