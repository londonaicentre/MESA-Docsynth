  presenting_complaint: Deep coma and respiratory insufficiency after intentional ingestion.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male was brought to A&E after consuming a litre of vodka and 20 tablets of diazepam. He was profoundly bradycardic and bradypnoeic, requiring immediate ventilatory support in the resuscitation room.

acute_toxicity_from_alcohol_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic ketoacidosis
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal pain, nausea, and deep, rapid breathing.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old chronic heavy drinker presented after a 5-day binge followed by 24 hours of no intake due to gastritis. Labs showed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (pH 7.18), positive serum ketones, and a low BAC of 35 mg/dL. He was successfully treated with IV saline and 5% dextrose to stimulate insulin release and suppress ketogenesis.

  primary_diagnosis: Acute alcohol toxicity in an elderly patient with polypharmacy
  presenting_complaint: Acute confusion and multiple falls after drinking gin.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female on warfarin and amlodipine was admitted after being found confused at home. She had a minor subarachnoid haemorrhage on CT head and a BAC of 0.12%, highlighting the risks of moderate alcohol use in the elderly. Management involved reversal of anticoagulation and close neurological observation in the trauma unit.

  primary_diagnosis: Acute alcohol toxicity with rhabdomyolysis
  presenting_complaint: Muscle pain and dark urine after being found on the floor.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male was found in his flat after an unknown period of unconsciousness following heavy drinking (BAC 280 mg/dL).

  presenting_complaint: Aggressive behaviour and scalp laceration after a fight.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male was brought in by police, appearing heavily intoxicated and combative with a BAC of 200 mg/dL. His agitation was initially attributed to alcohol, but a drop in GCS from 14 to 10 prompted a CT scan. This revealed a large extradural haematoma, necessitating urgent neurosurgical evacuation despite his high alcohol level.

  primary_diagnosis: Acute alcohol intoxication with Wernicke's encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and profound confusion out of proportion to intake.
  summary_of_course: A 47-year-old malnourished male presented with acute intoxication (BAC 150 mg/dL).

  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old female was admitted with moderate intoxication and a potassium level of 2.5 mmol/L. Her ECG showed a prolonged QTc interval of 515ms, increasing the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. She was treated with IV potassium and magnesium replacement alongside cardiac monitoring until her electrolytes and ECG normalised.

  primary_diagnosis: Acute alcohol toxicity in a first-time drinker
  presenting_complaint: Near-syncope and extreme nausea after consuming vodka.
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old female presented after consuming several shots of spirits at a party, her first significant exposure. She was hypotensive (BP 88/55 mmHg) and markedly ataxic but remained conscious with a BAC of 115 mg/dL. She was managed with oral rehydration and observation, recovering quickly as the alcohol was metabolised.
