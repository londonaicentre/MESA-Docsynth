  presenting_complaint: Bilateral proximal limb weakness ("man-in-a-barrel" syndrome).
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old female suffered a prolonged period of hypotension during a complex hip arthroplasty. Post-operatively, she exhibited bilateral weakness; MRI showed ischaemic changes in the border-zone territories between the ACA and MCA. Management focused on haemodynamic support and permissive hypertension to maintain cerebral perfusion.

  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of pre-existing hemiparesis and new-onset headache.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old patient originally admitted for an embolic MCA stroke showed neurological deterioration 48 hours post-thrombolysis. Repeat CT head demonstrated a large parenchymal haematoma (PH2) within the infarcted area. Anticoagulation was deferred, and intracranial pressure was managed medically.

  presenting_complaint: Sudden neck pain followed by right-sided weakness and Horner's syndrome.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male presented after a minor sports-related neck injury. CT angiogram showed a "string sign" in the left internal carotid artery and a corresponding embolic infarct in the left hemisphere.

  presenting_complaint: Fever, malaise, and sudden onset of confusion with expressive dysphasia.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old IV drug user was admitted with S. aureus bacteraemia. Echocardiography showed mitral valve vegetations, and MRI brain confirmed multiple small embolic infarcts in various vascular territories. He was treated with a 6-week course of IV antibiotics, avoiding thrombolysis due to the high risk of mycotic aneurysm rupture.

cerebral_infarction_012:
  primary_diagnosis: CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent TIA-like episodes and progressive cognitive decline.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with a family history of early-onset dementia presented with subacute gait instability. MRI showed extensive white matter hyperintensities and multiple old lacunar infarcts, particularly in the temporal poles.

  presenting_complaint: Severe headache, papilloedema, and focal seizures.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female on the combined oral contraceptive pill presented with worsening intracranial pressure.

  presenting_complaint: Progressive encephalopathy, chronic headache, and multifocal neurological deficits.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male presented with a three-month history of cognitive decline and intermittent limb weakness. Brain biopsy and catheter angiography suggested small-vessel vasculitis. He had evidence of multiple small cortical and subacute subcortical infarcts and was started on high-dose steroids and cyclophosphamide.

cerebral_infarction_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic cerebral infarction
  presenting_complaint: New-onset left-sided neglect and hemianopia post-cardiac catheterisation.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male underwent elective coronary angiography. Immediately post-procedure, he developed signs of a right MCA territory stroke. Urgent CT confirmed a small embolic infarct, likely due to plaque disruption during catheter manipulation. He was managed with antiplatelets and discharged to neuro-rehabilitation.

cerebral_infarction_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Silent cerebral infarction
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding on MRI performed for chronic tension-type headaches.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with hypertension and hyperlipidaemia underwent neuroimaging for unrelated headaches. MRI revealed multiple old, small subcortical infarcts in the basal ganglia and deep white matter that the patient had never been aware of. He was started on aspirin and a statin for primary stroke prevention.

  presenting_complaint: Recurrent focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic seizures.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female with a history of a large right-sided ischaemic stroke three years prior presented with new-onset seizures. EEG showed focal slowing over the right hemisphere, and MRI confirmed a large area of encephalomalacia in the old MCA territory. Seizures were well-controlled with levetiracetam monotherapy.

cerebral_infarction_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic cerebral infarction
  presenting_complaint: Worsening of stable right-sided weakness and new dysarthria.
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old male with a previous left-sided lacunar stroke presented with a new acute infarct in the same territory. Carotid Doppler showed 80% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery. Due to his frailty and the acute-on-chronic nature, he was managed medically with dual antiplatelets rather than carotid endarterectomy.

cerebral_infarction_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Cocaine-induced ischaemic stroke
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of confusion and right-sided hemiplegia following drug use.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male presented to A&E after a weekend of heavy cocaine use. Urine toxicology was positive for benzoylecgonine. MRI showed multiple acute ischaemic lesions in the left hemisphere, likely due to drug-induced vasospasm or acute hypertensive surge. He was managed in the stroke unit and referred to drug cessation services.
