pheochromocytoma_001:
  primary_diagnosis: pheochromocytoma
  presenting_complaint: Paroxysmal headaches, palpitations, and profuse diaphoresis.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female presented with a classic triad of symptoms occurring three times weekly. Plasma free metanephrines were significantly elevated (normetanephrine 4500 pmol/L). CT abdomen revealed a 4cm vascular right adrenal mass; she was stabilised with phenoxybenzamine followed by propranolol before successful laparoscopic adrenalectomy.

pheochromocytoma_002:
  primary_diagnosis: incidental pheochromocytoma
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic adrenal mass found on routine imaging.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male underwent CT staging for suspected diverticulitis, which incidentally identified a 3.2cm left adrenal lesion with high unenhanced attenuation (35 HU). Despite being normotensive, biochemical screening confirmed a pheochromocytoma with elevated urinary fractionated metanephrines. He underwent elective surgery without intraoperative complications after careful alpha-blockade.

pheochromocytoma_003:
  primary_diagnosis: pheochromocytoma crisis
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset flash pulmonary oedema and hypertensive emergency.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male was admitted to the ICU with a blood pressure of 250/140 mmHg and severe respiratory distress. Echocardiography showed global left ventricular dysfunction, and a subsequent CT scan identified a 6cm right-sided adrenal haemorrhagic mass. He required phentolamine infusion for BP control and eventual delayed surgical resection after stabilisation.

pheochromocytoma_004:
  primary_diagnosis: paediatric pheochromocytoma (VHL-associated)
  presenting_complaint: Sustained hypertension and blurred vision.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy with a family history of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome presented with persistent hypertension (150/95 mmHg). MRI confirmed bilateral adrenal masses and a small cerebellar haemangioblastoma. He underwent bilateral cortical-sparing adrenalectomies to mitigate the lifelong risk of Addisonian crises.

pheochromocytoma_005:
  primary_diagnosis: pheochromocytoma in MEN2A
  presenting_complaint: Routine screening in a patient with known medullary thyroid carcinoma.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female with a RET proto-oncogene mutation was screened annually for catecholamine excess. Recent plasma metanephrines showed a twofold rise, and MIBG scintigraphy confirmed a small left adrenal pheochromocytoma. She underwent a left-sided adrenalectomy prior to her scheduled total thyroidectomy.

pheochromocytoma_006:
  primary_diagnosis: pheochromocytoma in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Severe hypertension at 28 weeks gestation, initially managed as pre-eclampsia.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old primigravida presented with BP 190/110 mmHg and headaches but lacked proteinuria or oedema. Biochemical testing revealed massive catecholamine excess, and MRI confirmed a right adrenal mass. She was managed with phenoxybenzamine and underwent a combined Caesarean section and adrenalectomy at 32 weeks.

pheochromocytoma_007:
  primary_diagnosis: catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy
  presenting_complaint: Chronic fatigue, dyspnoea on exertion, and orthopnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female presented with symptoms of congestive heart failure and an ejection fraction of 25% on echocardiogram. Further investigation into her episodic flushing and tachycardia revealed a 5cm pheochromocytoma. Following alpha-blockade and surgical resection, her cardiac function improved significantly over six months.

pheochromocytoma_008:
  primary_diagnosis: undiagnosed pheochromocytoma
  presenting_complaint: Severe intraoperative hypertensive crisis during elective cholecystectomy.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with "essential" hypertension experienced a BP spike to 280/160 mmHg upon induction of anaesthesia. The procedure was aborted, and post-operative CT and biochemistry confirmed a pheochromocytoma. He was subsequently managed with doxazosin and underwent successful adrenalectomy three weeks later.

pheochromocytoma_009:
  primary_diagnosis: normotensive pheochromocytoma
  presenting_complaint: Unexplained weight loss, anxiety, and new-onset diabetes mellitus.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male presented with a 10kg weight loss and difficult-to-control hyperglycaemia despite a normal BMI. While his blood pressure remained 125/80 mmHg, a 24-hour urinary metanephrine collection was four times the upper limit of normal. CT imaging showed a 3.5cm left adrenal mass, and his diabetes resolved following surgical excision.

pheochromocytoma_010:
  primary_diagnosis: metastatic pheochromocytoma
  presenting_complaint: Persistent back pain and refractory hypertension.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female, ten years post-adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma, presented with lumbar pain. Imaging revealed multiple osteolytic lesions and a para-aortic mass, with significantly elevated plasma normetanephrine. She was started on alpha-blockers and referred for 131I-MIBG therapy and palliative radiotherapy.

pheochromocytoma_011:
  primary_diagnosis: drug-induced pheochromocytoma crisis
  presenting_complaint: Paradoxical hypertension after starting a beta-blocker for anxiety.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male was prescribed propranolol for palpitations and developed a hypertensive crisis (BP 230/130 mmHg) within hours of the first dose. This "unopposed alpha-stimulation" led to the diagnosis of a 4cm pheochromocytoma. He was switched to phenoxybenzamine and later underwent successful surgery.

pheochromocytoma_012:
  primary_diagnosis: extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma (paraganglioma)
  presenting_complaint: Micturition syncope and post-voiding palpitations.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female experienced episodes of fainting and tachycardia immediately after emptying her bladder. Cystoscopy and MRI revealed a 2cm mass within the bladder wall, and biochemistry confirmed catecholamine excess. The bladder paraganglioma was resected via a partial cystectomy.

pheochromocytoma_013:
  primary_diagnosis: retroperitoneal paraganglioma
  presenting_complaint: Vague abdominal pain and episodic sweating.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male presented with dull ache in the left flank and paroxysmal diaphoresis. Imaging showed a 7cm mass at the organ of Zuckerkandl, separate from the adrenal glands. Biochemical markers were elevated, and the mass was surgically removed following a standard alpha-blockade protocol.

pheochromocytoma_014:
  primary_diagnosis: pheochromocytoma in the elderly
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent falls, orthostatic hypotension, and confusion.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including CKD stage 3 and atrial fibrillation presented with fluctuating blood pressure. Despite the postural drops, she had periods of severe hypertension; a CT scan for suspected malignancy found a 4cm adrenal mass. Due to her frailty, she was managed medically with low-dose alpha-blockers and close monitoring.

pheochromocytoma_015:
  primary_diagnosis: recurrent pheochromocytoma
  presenting_complaint: Return of episodic headaches five years after initial surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male had previously undergone a right adrenalectomy. Surveillance imaging had been clear, but new-onset symptoms prompted a 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, which identified a small recurrence in the surgical bed. Re-operation was performed, and histology confirmed a recurrent pheochromocytoma with a PASS score of 6.

pheochromocytoma_016:
  primary_diagnosis: pheochromocytoma with SDHD mutation
  presenting_complaint: Neck mass and episodic tachycardia.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male presented with a painless lump in his neck, diagnosed as a carotid body tumor. Genetic screening for succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) mutations was positive (SDHD), and subsequent abdominal MRI identified a synchronous unilateral pheochromocytoma. Both lesions were managed surgically in a staged approach.

pheochromocytoma_017:
  primary_diagnosis: pheochromocytoma in Neurofibromatosis type 1
  presenting_complaint: Hypertension in a teenager with known NF1.
  summary_of_course: A 17-year-old female with multiple café au lait spots and cutaneous neurofibromas was found to have a BP of 165/105 mmHg during a routine clinic visit. Investigations revealed a 3cm right adrenal pheochromocytoma. She underwent a laparoscopic adrenalectomy, which successfully restored normotension.

pheochromocytoma_018:
  primary_diagnosis: malignant pheochromocytoma (SDHB mutation)
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal fullness and weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old male with a known SDHB mutation presented with a large 12cm abdominal mass. Biopsy was avoided, but biochemistry and MIBG uptake confirmed a pheochromocytoma with local invasion into the inferior vena cava. He underwent radical resection and was commenced on adjuvant chemotherapy due to the high risk of metastasis.

pheochromocytoma_019:
  primary_diagnosis: pheochromocytoma-induced stroke
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset left-sided weakness and severe headache.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male presented with a haemorrhagic stroke and a BP of 220/120 mmHg. After initial neurosurgical stabilisation, an underlying cause for the hypertensive bleed was sought, revealing a 4.5cm adrenal pheochromocytoma. He was treated with alpha-blockade and underwent adrenalectomy once his neurological status had stabilised.

pheochromocytoma_020:
  primary_diagnosis: adrenal apoplexy due to pheochromocytoma
  presenting_complaint: Sudden, severe abdominal pain followed by cardiovascular collapse.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female presented in shock with signs of peritonitis. Initial CT showed a ruptured 8cm adrenal mass with retroperitoneal haemorrhage; as her BP fluctuated wildly between 60/40 and 210/110 mmHg, she was diagnosed with pheochromocytoma apoplexy. Following emergency stabilisation and alpha-blockade, she underwent a delayed, successful adrenalectomy.
