  presenting_complaint: Productive cough and recurrent chest infections.
  summary_of_course: 55-year-old female with no smoking history but long-term exposure to biomass fuel in childhood. HRCT showed bronchial wall thickening consistent with chronic bronchitis but no bronchiectasis. She was managed with airway clearance techniques and a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA).

chronic_bronchitis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Chronic Bronchitis with Frequent Exacerbator Phenotype
  presenting_complaint: Four chest infections in the last six months.
  summary_of_course: 70-year-old male with FEV1 40% predicted and chronic sputum production. Despite optimal inhaler therapy (triple therapy), he suffered frequent exacerbations. He was started on prophylactic low-dose azithromycin three times weekly following a cardiac review and QTc monitoring.

  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Bronchitis and Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath and cough in early middle age.
  summary_of_course: 39-year-old male presented with symptoms of chronic bronchitis. Blood tests revealed a low Alpha-1 antitrypsin level (PiZZ genotype). Management focused on aggressive smoking cessation, vaccination, and referral for consideration of augmentation therapy.
