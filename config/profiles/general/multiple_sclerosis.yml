  primary_diagnosis: Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS)
  presenting_complaint: Right-sided optic neuritis and painful eye movements.
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old female presented with subacute loss of central vision in the right eye and retro-orbital pain. MRI brain revealed three periventricular T2-hyperintense lesions and gadolinium enhancement of the right optic nerve. CSF analysis showed unmatched oligoclonal bands, confirming a diagnosis of RRMS; she was treated with IV methylprednisolone and commenced on dimethyl fumarate.

multiple_sclerosis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS)
  presenting_complaint: Gradual worsening of gait and balance over 18 months.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male reported a slow, non-relapsing decline in his ability to walk, describing a "heavy" left leg. Spinal MRI showed diffuse cord atrophy and two T2 lesions in the cervical cord, while brain MRI met McDonald criteria for dissemination in space. He was diagnosed with PPMS and initiated on ocrelizumab infusions to slow disability progression.

multiple_sclerosis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SPMS)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive mobility decline following 15 years of relapsing disease.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female with a long history of RRMS reported that her walking distance had steadily decreased from 1km to 100m over the last two years without distinct relapses. Clinical assessment confirmed an EDSS score of 6.0, indicating a transition to SPMS. After reviewing MRI activity, she was transitioned from interferon-beta to siponimod.

multiple_sclerosis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Multiple Sclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of double vision and truncal ataxia.
  summary_of_course: A 13-year-old girl presented with sudden onset diplopia and unsteady gait. Initial MRI showed multiple large, fluffy demyelinating lesions, initially raising suspicion of ADEM, but a follow-up scan at 6 months showed new silent lesions. She was diagnosed with paediatric-onset MS and started on fingolimod due to high disease activity.

multiple_sclerosis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Tumefactive Multiple Sclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Right-sided hemiparesis and expressive aphasia.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male presented with acute focal neurological deficits mimicking a stroke or malignancy. MRI brain demonstrated a 4.5cm ring-enhancing lesion in the left frontal lobe with significant mass effect and minimal oedema. Brain biopsy confirmed inflammatory demyelination consistent with tumefactive MS, and he responded well to high-dose steroids and plasma exchange.

multiple_sclerosis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Fulminant Multiple Sclerosis (Marburg Variant)
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive tetraplegia and respiratory failure.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female experienced a devastating, monophasic decline over three weeks, progressing from limb weakness to complete paralysis and coma. MRI showed extensive, confluent demyelination across the brainstem and hemispheres. Despite aggressive ICU support and cyclophosphamide, the patient succumbed to neurogenic respiratory failure, representing a rare Marburg variant presentation.

multiple_sclerosis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Benign Multiple Sclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Routine follow-up for long-standing stable disease.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female was originally diagnosed with MS 25 years ago following a single episode of paraesthesia. She has had no further relapses and remains fully ambulatory with an EDSS of 1.0. Serial MRI scans show no new T2 lesions or atrophy, categorising her clinical course as benign MS, managed with watchful waiting.

multiple_sclerosis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: RRMS with Urosepsis
  presenting_complaint: Fever, rigors, and acute worsening of pre-existing leg weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male with known RRMS and a neurogenic bladder presented to A&E with confusion and pyrexia. Investigations confirmed E. coli bacteraemia secondary to a urinary tract infection, which had triggered a pseudo-relapse of his MS symptoms. He was treated with IV ceftriaxone and required temporary catheterisation, with neurological symptoms returning to baseline as the infection resolved.

multiple_sclerosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: RRMS with Steroid-Induced Hyperglycaemia
  presenting_complaint: Acute sensory relapse and blurred vision.
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old female with RRMS and comorbid Type 1 Diabetes presented with a new sensory level at T10. Treatment with high-dose IV methylprednisolone caused severe hyperglycaemia and incipient ketoacidosis. She was managed with a variable rate insulin infusion (sliding scale) while completing her steroid course, requiring close coordination between neurology and endocrinology.

multiple_sclerosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) mimic
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral leg weakness and urinary retention.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female presented with acute transverse myelitis extending over four vertebral segments (LETM). Initial suspicion was NMOSD, but AQP4 and MOG antibodies were negative, and brain MRI showed classic Dawson’s fingers. She was ultimately diagnosed with MS and started on natalizumab due to the severity of the spinal cord presentation.

multiple_sclerosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: RRMS with Treatment-Related PML Risk
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic; routine monitoring of JCV serology.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old male had been stable on natalizumab for six years. Recent blood tests showed a high-titre JCV antibody index of 3.8, placing him at high risk for Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). After a detailed risk-benefit discussion, he underwent a washout period and was switched to cladribine to maintain disease control while mitigating viral reactivation risk.

multiple_sclerosis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Late-Onset Multiple Sclerosis (LOMS)
  presenting_complaint: New onset urinary urgency and frequent falls.
  summary_of_course: A 71-year-old male presented with progressive balance issues previously attributed to "old age." MRI brain revealed multiple periventricular and infratentorial plaques, and CSF showed 12 oligoclonal bands. Despite his age, the diagnosis of LOMS was made; treatment was tailored to his comorbidities (hypertension and BPH), opting for a less intensive oral DMT.

multiple_sclerosis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Postpartum RRMS Relapse
  presenting_complaint: Severe vertigo and ataxia three months after delivery.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female with known RRMS had been stable throughout her pregnancy but experienced a rebound relapse 12 weeks postpartum. She presented with disabling vertigo and nystagmus, requiring IV steroids. A multidisciplinary decision was made to cease breastfeeding to allow the urgent initiation of high-efficacy therapy with alemtuzumab.

  primary_diagnosis: Balo's Concentric Sclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of confusion and right-sided neglect.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male presented with subacute encephalopathy and focal signs. MRI revealed a large lesion in the left parietal lobe with alternating rings of hyperintensity and isointensity, resembling an onion skin. This rare variant of MS was treated with aggressive immunosuppression using cyclophosphamide and high-dose corticosteroids, resulting in partial functional recovery.

multiple_sclerosis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: MS-associated Trigeminal Neuralgia
  presenting_complaint: Paroxysmal, electric-shock-like facial pain.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female presented with lancinating pain in the right V2 distribution triggered by chewing. MRI brain showed a demyelinating plaque at the trigeminal nerve root entry zone in the pons. She was diagnosed with MS-associated trigeminal neuralgia and managed with carbamazepine and a course of oral prednisolone for the acute inflammatory component.

multiple_sclerosis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Brainstem Relapse (Severe)
  presenting_complaint: Dysphagia, dysarthria, and impaired consciousness.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male with known RRMS was admitted to the ICU following a rapid decline in bulbar function. MRI showed a new, large enhancing lesion in the medulla and pons causing obstructive hydrocephalus. He required intubation for airway protection and was treated with IVMP followed by five cycles of plasma exchange, eventually transferring to neurorehabilitation.

multiple_sclerosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: MS with Psychiatric Presentation
  presenting_complaint: First-episode psychosis and auditory hallucinations.
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old male with no prior history was admitted to a psychiatric ward with paranoid delusions. A routine neurological screen revealed brisk reflexes and a positive Babinski sign; subsequent MRI showed multiple demyelinating lesions in the temporal lobes and corpus callosum. His psychiatric symptoms resolved significantly following steroid treatment for MS, highlighting an atypical inflammatory presentation.

multiple_sclerosis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: RRMS with Autonomic Dysfunction
  presenting_complaint: Chronic constipation and erectile dysfunction.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with a 5-year history of RRMS presented with worsening autonomic symptoms that were severely impacting his quality of life. Clinical evaluation identified neurogenic bowel and bladder, alongside significant erectile dysfunction. Management involved a combination of sildenafil, a high-fibre diet with osmotic laxatives, and referral to a specialist neuro-urology clinic.

multiple_sclerosis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Radiologically Isolated Syndrome (RIS) progressing to RRMS
  presenting_complaint: Lhermitte’s sign and left arm numbness.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old female had an incidental MRI in 2021 for trauma which showed lesions "highly suggestive of MS" (RIS). Two years later, she developed an electric-shock sensation down her spine on neck flexion (Lhermitte’s). This clinical event, combined with her prior imaging, confirmed a diagnosis of RRMS, and she was started on teriflunomide.
