pressure_ulcer_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Category 1 sacral pressure ulcer
  presenting_complaint: Persistent redness over the sacrum that does not fade
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female resident of a care home presented with non-blanching erythema over the sacral prominence. She has limited mobility due to severe osteoarthritis and vascular dementia. Clinical assessment confirmed a Category 1 pressure ulcer, managed with a high-specification foam mattress and a 2-hourly repositioning regime. The redness resolved within 7 days with improved nutritional support and skin barrier creams.

pressure_ulcer_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Category 4 ischial pressure ulcer with osteomyelitis
  presenting_complaint: Deep open wound on the buttock with visible bone
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male with T4 complete spinal cord injury presented with a chronic ischial ulcer of 6 months' duration. Examination revealed a 5cm deep cavity with exposed ischial tuberosity and foul-smelling discharge. MRI confirmed underlying osteomyelitis, requiring surgical debridement and a 6-week course of intravenous antibiotics. The patient was referred to the plastic surgery team for a rotational flap repair.

pressure_ulcer_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Unstageable pressure ulcer of the left heel
  presenting_complaint: Black, leathery patch on the heel
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male in the ICU for sepsis secondary to pneumonia developed a dark, necrotic eschar on his left heel. The wound bed was completely obscured by stable eschar, making it unstageable at the time of initial assessment. Offloading was achieved using heel suspension boots. Following gradual autolytic debridement with hydrogel, the wound was eventually classified as a Category 3 ulcer and treated with negative pressure wound therapy.

pressure_ulcer_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Category 2 medical device-related pressure ulcer
  presenting_complaint: Skin breakdown on the bridge of the nose
  summary_of_course: A neonate born at 28 weeks' gestation required continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) via a nasal mask in the NICU. On day 4, a partial-thickness skin loss with a shallow open ulcer was noted on the nasal bridge. The mask was adjusted to a different interface and hydrocolloid dressings were applied to protect the area. The ulcer healed within 5 days without further complication.

pressure_ulcer_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Category 3 sacral pressure ulcer
  presenting_complaint: Deep open sore on the lower back with yellow slough
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female admitted with a fractured neck of femur (NOF) developed a sacral ulcer post-operatively. Assessment showed full-thickness skin loss involving subcutaneous fat but without exposed bone or tendon. The wound bed contained 40% yellow slough and 60% granulation tissue. Management included sharp debridement by a tissue viability nurse and the application of alginate dressings.

pressure_ulcer_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Deep tissue pressure injury (DTPI)
  presenting_complaint: Purple, blood-filled blister on the right heel
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with Type 2 diabetes and peripheral neuropathy presented with a localised area of purple discolouration on his right heel. The skin was intact but felt boggy compared to surrounding tissue. This was diagnosed as a deep tissue pressure injury likely caused by prolonged immobility during a recent long-haul flight. Despite immediate offloading, the area evolved into a Category 4 ulcer over the following week.

pressure_ulcer_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Kennedy Terminal Ulcer
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly appearing butterfly-shaped ulcer on the sacrum
  summary_of_course: A 90-year-old female with end-stage heart failure in a hospice setting developed a sudden, large, butterfly-shaped ulcer over her sacrum. The wound was multi-coloured with irregular borders and progressed rapidly from intact skin to full-thickness loss within 24 hours. Given the patient's terminal status, the focus of care remained on comfort, pain management, and odour control rather than curative wound healing.

pressure_ulcer_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Category 4 pressure ulcer with septicaemia
  presenting_complaint: Large, infected hip wound with high fever and confusion
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with advanced multiple sclerosis was admitted with a Grade 4 trochanteric pressure ulcer. She was tachycardic and hypotensive, with blood cultures positive for Staphylococcus aureus. The ulcer showed extensive undermining and necrotic tissue. She was treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation, intravenous flucloxacillin, and urgent surgical debridement of the necrotic site.

pressure_ulcer_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Category 2 pressure ulcer in abdominal skin fold
  presenting_complaint: Red, weeping area in the lower abdominal fold
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with morbid obesity (BMI 48) and limited mobility presented with a shallow ulcer in his infra-abdominal skin fold. The lesion was characterized by partial-thickness loss of the dermis and was exacerbated by moisture-associated skin damage (intertrigo). Treatment involved improved hygiene, moisture-wicking textiles, and a barrier film to prevent further maceration.

pressure_ulcer_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Category 2 medical device-related pressure ulcer of the ear
  presenting_complaint: Painful ulcer on the top of the right ear
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old male with COPD required high-flow nasal cannula oxygen. After three days of continuous use, a Category 2 pressure ulcer developed on the superior aspect of the pinna where the tubing rested. The delivery system was switched to a face mask to remove pressure from the ears. The ulcer was treated with a thin foam dressing and healed within two weeks.

pressure_ulcer_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Category 3 sacral pressure ulcer
  presenting_complaint: Large, deep wound on the back following a fall
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male was found on his floor 48 hours after an accidental drug overdose. Upon admission, he had a significant Category 3 pressure ulcer over his sacrum due to prolonged contact with the hard floor. Blood tests showed an elevated creatine kinase (CK) of 15,000 U/L, indicating rhabdomyolysis. The wound required surgical debridement and vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy.

pressure_ulcer_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic Category 2 pressure ulcer of the malleolus
  presenting_complaint: Skin breakdown under a compression bandage
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female with chronic venous insufficiency was being treated with four-layer compression bandaging for a venous leg ulcer. During a dressing change, a new Category 2 pressure ulcer was identified over the lateral malleolus, caused by excessive pressure from the bandage over a bony prominence. The bandaging technique was modified to include extra padding over the malleoli, and the new ulcer healed successfully.

pressure_ulcer_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Category 4 pressure ulcer with necrotic eschar
  presenting_complaint: Blackened, foul-smelling wound on the heel
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old male, three weeks post-ischaemic stroke with dense right-sided hemiplegia, developed a necrotic heel ulcer. Assessment revealed a Category 4 lesion with liquefactive necrosis and a putrid odour. Despite conservative sharp debridement and antimicrobial dressings, the patient's peripheral vascular disease limited healing potential. He eventually required a below-knee amputation due to progressive gangrene.

pressure_ulcer_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent Category 4 ischial pressure ulcer
  presenting_complaint: Breakdown of a previous surgical flap site
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male with paraplegia presented with a recurrence of a Category 4 ischial ulcer at the margin of a previous rotation flap. The patient admitted to poor compliance with his pressure relief schedule and a malfunctioning wheelchair cushion. Investigations showed no new osteomyelitis. He was managed with strict bed rest on an air-fluidised bed and a revised seating assessment before considering further reconstructive surgery.

pressure_ulcer_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Mucosal pressure ulcer of the lower lip
  presenting_complaint: Deep ulceration on the inner lip
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with ARDS was intubated and ventilated in the ICU for 14 days. A mucosal pressure ulcer developed on the lower lip due to the pressure of the endotracheal tube. Unlike cutaneous ulcers, this was not staged using the standard NPUAP system. The tube was repositioned daily by the nursing staff, and the ulcer resolved following extubation and the application of topical oral gels.

pressure_ulcer_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Category 2 pressure ulcer with secondary cellulitis
  presenting_complaint: Red, swollen, and painful skin around a sacral sore
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old female with advanced dementia and urinary incontinence developed a Category 2 sacral ulcer. Within 48 hours, the surrounding skin became hot, erythematous, and exquisitely tender, extending 5cm from the wound edges. She was diagnosed with secondary cellulitis and started on oral flucloxacillin. Improved continence management and more frequent dressing changes led to the resolution of the infection.

pressure_ulcer_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Category 1 pressure ulcer of the heel
  presenting_complaint: Redness on the heel that doesn't go away
  summary_of_course: A 92-year-old female in a nursing home was noted to have persistent redness on her left heel during a routine skin check. She had been spending increased time in her armchair due to a recent chest infection. The area was diagnosed as a Category 1 pressure ulcer. Immediate intervention with "floating the heels" using pillows and the provision of a pressure-relieving cushion prevented progression to skin breakdown.

pressure_ulcer_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Category 3 pressure ulcer following cardiac surgery
  presenting_complaint: Open wound on the sacrum after a long operation
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male underwent a complex 8-hour coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). On the second post-operative day, a Category 3 pressure ulcer was identified on his sacrum, likely due to intraoperative immobility and poor perfusion. The wound was managed with a silicone foam dressing and a dynamic air mattress. It showed good granulation tissue after 14 days of intensive nutritional supplementation.

pressure_ulcer_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Category 4 pressure ulcer with a sinus tract
  presenting_complaint: Small opening on the hip that drains large amounts of fluid
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis presented with a Category 4 greater trochanteric ulcer. Probing of the wound revealed a 4cm sinus tract extending towards the hip joint. An MRI scan showed fluid collections but no joint involvement. The sinus was managed with ribbon gauze packing and systemic antibiotics, though healing was slow due to the patient's chronic anaemia and malnutrition.

pressure_ulcer_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Category 4 pressure ulcer with myiasis
  presenting_complaint: Deep, neglected sacral wound containing larvae
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male with chronic alcoholism and homelessness was brought to A&E after being found collapsed. He had a massive Category 4 sacral ulcer that had been neglected for weeks, showing evidence of myiasis (maggot infestation). The wound was manually debrided, irrigated with saline, and treated with antimicrobial dressings. He received broad-spectrum antibiotics and social work input for long-term placement and wound care.
