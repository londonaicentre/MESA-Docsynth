alcoholic_polyneuropathy_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic alcoholic polyneuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral burning pain and numbness in the feet.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with a 20-year history of heavy spirit consumption (approx. 80 units/week) presented with progressive "glove and stocking" sensory loss. Clinical examination revealed absent ankle jerks and reduced vibration sense to the mid-shin. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) confirmed a length-dependent axonal sensory-motor neuropathy; he was commenced on high-dose oral thiamine and referred to alcohol transition services.

alcoholic_polyneuropathy_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic alcoholic polyneuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of gait instability and severe calf pain.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with known alcohol dependence presented following a six-week binge with minimal nutritional intake. She exhibited profound distal muscle weakness (MRC grade 3/5 in dorsiflexion) and exquisite tenderness in the gastrocnemius. Laboratory tests showed macrocytic anaemia and low serum thiamine; she was treated with intravenous Pabrinex and intensive physiotherapy, showing partial motor recovery over three months.

alcoholic_polyneuropathy_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild alcoholic polyneuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent tingling in the toes and "pins and needles".
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old city professional reported mild paraesthesia in both feet, primarily at night. History revealed regular heavy social drinking exceeding 40 units weekly but no significant comorbidities. Early signs of reduced pinprick sensation were noted distally; symptoms stabilised following a significant reduction in alcohol intake and vitamin B complex supplementation.

alcoholic_polyneuropathy_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe alcoholic polyneuropathy with autonomic dysfunction
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent falls and persistent light-headedness upon standing.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with long-term alcohol misuse presented with severe sensory ataxia and orthostatic hypotension (30mmHg drop). Investigations confirmed impaired heart rate variability and distal axonal loss on NCS. Management involved fludrocortisone for autonomic symptoms and strict alcohol abstinence, though he remained dependent on a walking frame for mobility.

alcoholic_polyneuropathy_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic polyneuropathy complicated by Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, ataxia, and profound weakness in the lower limbs.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old homeless male was admitted via A&E with ophthalmoplegia and global confusion. Alongside cognitive deficits, he demonstrated absent deep tendon reflexes and severe distal wasting. Following ICU stabilisation and parenteral thiamine, his ocular signs resolved, but the severe polyneuropathy necessitated long-term residential care due to permanent foot drop.

alcoholic_polyneuropathy_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Mixed alcoholic and diabetic polyneuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Numbness in feet and slow-healing toe ulcer.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male with Type 2 Diabetes and a history of daily wine consumption (50 units/week) presented with a neuropathic ulcer. Differentiating the aetiology was challenging, but the severity of axonal loss on NCS was disproportionate to his HbA1c of 52 mmol/mol, suggesting alcohol as a major contributor. Treatment focused on pressure relief, glycaemic control, and alcohol cessation.

alcoholic_polyneuropathy_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute painful alcoholic polyneuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Intolerable "electric shock" sensations in both legs.
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old female presented with rapidly progressing neuropathic pain over three weeks. She had recently increased her alcohol intake following redundancy. Examination showed hyperalgesia and allodynia below the knees; she was started on Pregabalin and thiamine, requiring a multidisciplinary pain management approach to achieve functional improvement.

alcoholic_polyneuropathy_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic polyneuropathy with secondary pressure sores
  presenting_complaint: Infected skin lesions on the heels and inability to walk.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old isolated male was found with Grade 3 pressure ulcers on both heels, attributed to profound sensory loss and immobility from chronic alcohol-related nerve damage. He had significant distal muscle atrophy and "steppage" gait. Admission for IV antibiotics and surgical debridement was required, with long-term placement in a nursing home due to unsafe mobility.

alcoholic_polyneuropathy_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Early-onset alcoholic polyneuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Loss of balance and frequent tripping.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male with a history of severe vodka dependence since age 18 presented with bilateral foot drop. Neurological exam confirmed distal motor weakness and loss of vibration sense to the pelvis. Despite his young age, the severity of his alcohol use led to advanced axonal degeneration usually seen in much older patients; he showed modest improvement after six months of sobriety.

alcoholic_polyneuropathy_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic polyneuropathy with predominantly motor involvement
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty climbing stairs and lifting feet.
  summary_of_course: A 49-year-old male presented with significant proximal and distal leg weakness. Initially suspected to have CIDP, his history of 100 units of alcohol per week and low B12/folate levels pointed towards a nutritional/toxic cause. NCS showed low amplitude CMAPs with preserved conduction velocities, consistent with alcoholic axonal degeneration; he responded well to abstinence and intensive physical rehabilitation.

alcoholic_polyneuropathy_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic polyneuropathy in the setting of Decompensated Cirrhosis
  presenting_complaint: Swelling of the abdomen and numbness in extremities.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female with jaundice and ascites was noted to have significant peripheral neuropathy during her admission for liver failure. The neuropathy limited her ability to participate in physiotherapy for sarcopenia. Management was palliative-focused, aiming for symptom control of neuropathic pain with low-dose gabapentin while managing her hepatic encephalopathy.

alcoholic_polyneuropathy_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic alcoholic polyneuropathy (Treatment Failure)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive loss of hand function and persistent leg numbness.
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old male continued to consume 60+ units of cider weekly despite a diagnosis of polyneuropathy two years prior. His symptoms progressed from the lower limbs to involve the small muscles of the hands (intrinsic wasting). Despite repeated vitamin prescriptions, the ongoing ethanol neurotoxicity resulted in permanent disability and the need for home adaptations.

alcoholic_polyneuropathy_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic polyneuropathy with Vitamin B12 deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Tingling in hands and feet with associated fatigue.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with chronic alcoholism was found to have macrocytic anaemia (MCV 115) and low B12 levels. Examination showed loss of joint position sense and absent reflexes, suggesting a mixed picture of alcoholic neuropathy and subacute combined degeneration of the cord. He received hydroxocobalamin injections and oral thiamine, resulting in significant resolution of upper limb symptoms.

alcoholic_polyneuropathy_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild alcoholic polyneuropathy (Community Screening)
  presenting_complaint: Subjective "heaviness" in the legs during long walks.
  summary_of_course: During a routine GP review for hypertension, a 50-year-old female mentioned occasional leg discomfort. Screening revealed reduced monofilament sensation at the hallux and diminished ankle jerks. She admitted to drinking two bottles of wine daily; early intervention with alcohol brief advice and thiamine prevented further symptomatic progression over a 12-month follow-up.

alcoholic_polyneuropathy_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe alcoholic polyneuropathy (Acute-on-Chronic)
  presenting_complaint: Total inability to weight-bear following a period of self-neglect.
  summary_of_course: A 57-year-old male was admitted with severe malnutrition and dehydration. He had profound distal wasting and was unable to move his ankles (MRC 0/5). NCS showed unrecordable sensory and motor responses in the lower limbs. After four weeks of inpatient nutritional support and abstinence, he regained minimal toe movement but remained wheelchair-dependent.

alcoholic_polyneuropathy_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic polyneuropathy with neuropathic arthropathy (Charcot Joint)
  presenting_complaint: Swollen, deformed right ankle without significant pain.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old chronic alcoholic presented with a painless but severely deformed ankle joint. Radiographs confirmed Charcot neuroarthropathy secondary to profound loss of protective sensation from alcoholic polyneuropathy. Management involved offloading with a total contact cast and strict alcohol cessation to prevent further joint destruction and potential amputation.

alcoholic_polyneuropathy_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic polyneuropathy (Diagnostic Challenge)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive weakness initially misdiagnosed as lumbar radiculopathy.
  summary_of_course: A 51-year-old male underwent unsuccessful spinal decompression for suspected L4/L5 radiculopathy. Post-operatively, his bilateral symptoms persisted and progressed; a detailed history then revealed significant undisclosed alcohol use. Subsequent NCS/EMG confirmed a generalised axonal polyneuropathy rather than focal nerve root compression, and his symptoms stabilised only after addressing his alcohol intake.

alcoholic_polyneuropathy_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic polyneuropathy with Upper Limb Predominance
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty with fine motor tasks and "burning" hands.
  summary_of_course: A 47-year-old female tailor presented with an unusual distribution of neuropathy, where her hands were more symptomatic than her feet. She had a 15-year history of heavy gin consumption. While NCS showed a generalised process, the functional impact on her hands was severe; she required occupational therapy and high-dose amitriptyline for sensory symptoms.

alcoholic_polyneuropathy_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcoholic polyneuropathy with Gastroparesis
  presenting_complaint: Nausea, vomiting, and numbness in the feet.
  summary_of_course: A 53-year-old male with long-standing alcohol misuse presented with symptoms of delayed gastric emptying. Gastric emptying studies confirmed gastroparesis, and neurological exam showed classic signs of alcoholic polyneuropathy. This suggested extensive involvement of both the peripheral and autonomic nervous systems; management included prokinetics, thiamine, and small frequent meals.

alcoholic_polyneuropathy_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Life-threatening Alcoholic Polyneuropathy with Respiratory Failure
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath and profound generalised weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old female with extreme alcohol-related malnutrition was admitted to the ICU. In addition to severe peripheral neuropathy, she developed respiratory muscle weakness (reduced vital capacity) and required temporary non-invasive ventilation. Investigations showed profound thiamine and phosphate depletion (refeeding syndrome risk); intensive replacement therapy and long-term rehab were required for her to eventually return to independent living.
