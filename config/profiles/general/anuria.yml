anuria_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis
  presenting_complaint: Facial swelling and lack of urine for 24 hours
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy presented with periorbital oedema and hypertension two weeks after a sore throat. His mother reported he had not passed urine since the previous morning, and a bladder scan confirmed an empty bladder. Investigations showed low C3 complement levels and high ASOT titres, confirming post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis which required a period of peritoneal dialysis.

anuria_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Obstructive Uropathy due to Prostatic Hyperplasia
  presenting_complaint: Lower abdominal pain and inability to void for 18 hours
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male presented to A&E with severe suprapubic discomfort and acute-on-chronic urinary retention. A bedside ultrasound revealed a massively distended bladder and bilateral hydronephrosis, with a creatinine of 640 µmol/L. Following difficult urethral catheterisation, he experienced a post-obstructive diuresis of 4 litres in 2 hours, requiring careful fluid replacement.

anuria_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Flash Pulmonary Oedema secondary to Bilateral Renal Artery Stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset shortness of breath and zero urine output
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with known atherosclerotic disease was started on Ramipril for hypertension. Three days later, she presented with life-threatening pulmonary oedema and absolute anuria. Diagnosis of bilateral renal artery stenosis was confirmed via renal artery Doppler, and her renal function improved significantly after the ACE inhibitor was withheld and renal stenting was performed.

anuria_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Bloody diarrhoea followed by anuria and pallor
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old girl was admitted with a 5-day history of bloody diarrhoea and subsequent cessation of micturition. Laboratory tests revealed microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and a creatinine of 400 µmol/L. She was diagnosed with Shiga toxin-produced HUS and required urgent haemodialysis for five days before renal recovery began.

anuria_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Interstitial Nephritis
  presenting_complaint: Maculopapular rash and sudden drop in urine output
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old woman taking Naproxen for osteoarthritis developed a systemic rash and fever. Within 48 hours, her urine output dropped to less than 50ml per day despite adequate hydration. Renal biopsy confirmed acute interstitial nephritis with eosinophilic infiltration; she was treated with high-dose corticosteroids, leading to a gradual restoration of urine output.

anuria_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI
  presenting_complaint: Dark 'tea-coloured' urine followed by anuria
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male was found collapsed following a prolonged period of immobilisation after drug ingestion. He initially passed a small amount of dark brown urine but then became completely anuric. Creatine kinase was elevated at 150,000 U/L and hyperkalaemia of 6.8 mmol/L necessitated emergency haemodialysis while his kidneys recovered from myoglobin-induced injury.

anuria_008:
  primary_diagnosis: End-Stage Renal Disease with Missed Dialysis
  presenting_complaint: Severe breathlessness and anuria for 3 days
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with known ESRD on maintenance haemodialysis missed three consecutive sessions due to personal issues. He presented to the emergency department with absolute anuria, peripheral oedema, and life-threatening hyperkalaemia of 7.2 mmol/L with ECG changes. He was treated with urgent calcium gluconate and insulin-dextrose before being stabilised on emergency dialysis.

anuria_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Bilateral Ureteric Calculi
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent loin pain followed by total anuria
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with a history of nephrolithiasis presented with sudden onset bilateral flank pain that spontaneously resolved, followed by 24 hours of no urine production. Non-contrast CT KUB revealed obstructing calculi in both proximal ureters. He underwent urgent bilateral retrograde stent insertion, which resulted in immediate relief of the anuria.

anuria_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Ischaemic AKI post-Aortic Aneurysm Repair
  presenting_complaint: Post-operative anuria following AAA repair
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male underwent an open repair of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. Post-operatively, he remained anuric for 48 hours despite optimal haemodynamics and a patent urinary catheter. The prolonged cross-clamp time resulted in severe ischaemic acute kidney injury, requiring two weeks of renal replacement therapy in the ICU before his output returned.

anuria_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Hepatorenal Syndrome Type 1
  presenting_complaint: Worsening jaundice and cessation of urine output
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis and refractory ascites was admitted with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. His renal function rapidly deteriorated over 72 hours, culminating in absolute anuria that was unresponsive to fluid boluses and albumin. He was diagnosed with Hepatorenal Syndrome Type 1 and started on Terlipressin and albumin as a bridge to potential liver transplantation.

anuria_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Neonatal Renal Vein Thrombosis
  presenting_complaint: Palpable flank masses and failure to pass urine
  summary_of_course: A 2-day-old neonate born to a mother with gestational diabetes failed to pass urine since birth. Physical examination revealed bilateral palpable abdominal masses and gross haematuria on the only occasion a few drops were passed. Doppler ultrasound confirmed bilateral renal vein thrombosis; the infant was managed with supportive care and anticoagulation in the neonatal ICU.

anuria_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Anti-GBM Disease (Goodpasture's Syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Haemoptysis and rapidly declining urine output
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old male smoker presented with a cough, haemoptysis, and malaise. Within three days of admission, his urine output fell to zero and his creatinine rose to 900 µmol/L. Serology was positive for anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies, and he was treated with plasma exchange, steroids, and cyclophosphamide, though he remained dialysis-dependent.

anuria_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Contrast-Induced Nephropathy
  presenting_complaint: Anuria following coronary angiography
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old diabetic male with pre-existing stage 4 CKD underwent an urgent coronary intervention for an acute coronary syndrome. Despite pre-procedure hydration, he developed absolute anuria 24 hours after the administration of iodinated contrast. His renal function failed to recover to baseline, and he eventually transitioned to long-term outpatient haemodialysis.

anuria_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Myeloma Cast Nephropathy
  presenting_complaint: Severe back pain and anuria
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old female presented with a pathological fracture of the rib and new-onset anuria. Laboratory results showed hypercalcaemia and a significant paraprotein gap, with Bence-Jones proteins in the trace amounts of urine obtained. A bone marrow biopsy confirmed multiple myeloma, and she was started on chemotherapy and bortezomib alongside haemodialysis for cast nephropathy.

anuria_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Dehydration and Heatstroke
  presenting_complaint: Confusion and no urine output during a heatwave
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old long-distance runner collapsed during a summer marathon and was found to have a core temperature of 41°C. He was profoundly dehydrated and remained anuric for 36 hours despite receiving 6 litres of intravenous crystalloids. His condition was complicated by multi-organ failure, but his renal function eventually recovered after a week of supportive ICU care.

anuria_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Preeclampsia with HELLP Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Epigastric pain and anuria at 34 weeks gestation
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old primigravida presented with a headache, visual disturbances, and a total lack of urine for 12 hours. Bloods showed haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets, with a creatinine of 210 µmol/L. Following emergency Caesarean section, she remained anuric for a further 24 hours before a slow recovery of renal function with intensive fluid monitoring.

anuria_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Bladder Carcinoma with Ureteric Obstruction
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss and sudden cessation of micturition
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with a history of smoking and intermittent painless haematuria presented with absolute anuria. Imaging revealed a large bladder base tumour invading both ureteric orifices, causing bilateral hydronephrosis. He was managed with bilateral percutaneous nephrostomies, which successfully bypassed the obstruction and restored urine flow and renal function.

anuria_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Hyperacute Renal Transplant Rejection
  presenting_complaint: Immediate post-operative anuria following transplant
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female received a deceased-donor renal transplant. Intraoperatively, the graft became mottled and cyanotic immediately after reperfusion, and no urine was produced in the following 6 hours. Despite aggressive immunosuppression, the graft was non-viable due to pre-formed antibodies, and a transplant nephrectomy was performed the next day.

anuria_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Ethylene Glycol Poisoning
  presenting_complaint: Altered consciousness and anuria
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male was brought to A&E after being found unconscious with an empty bottle of antifreeze nearby. He was profoundly acidotic with a large osmolar gap and became completely anuric within hours of admission. Treatment with Fomepizole and urgent haemodialysis was initiated to remove the toxic metabolites (glycolic acid) and manage the acute kidney injury.
