pale_pallor_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Hereditary Spherocytosis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent jaundice and mild pallor
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old girl presented with intermittent episodes of mild jaundice and pallor, often following viral infections. Physical examination revealed moderate splenomegaly, and a blood film showed numerous spherocytes with an increased reticulocyte count. She was managed conservatively with folic acid supplementation, with plans for a possible splenectomy in later childhood if haemolytic crises became more frequent.

  presenting_complaint: Recurrent epistaxis and extreme fatigue
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented with a three-week history of spontaneous nosebleeds and a "deathly" pale appearance. Blood results showed severe pancytopenia (Hb 55g/L, Neutrophils 0.4 x 10^9/L, Platelets 12 x 10^9/L), and bone marrow trephine biopsy confirmed a hypocellular marrow. He was commenced on antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and ciclosporin after failing to find a matched bone marrow donor.

pale_pallor_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Myxedema (Severe Hypothyroidism)
  presenting_complaint: Weight gain and cold intolerance
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female presented with a slow onset of cognitive slowing, periorbital puffiness, and a pasty, pale skin texture. Laboratory tests revealed a TSH of 105 mIU/L and an undetectable free T4. She was started on a low dose of levothyroxine (25mcg), which was gradually titrated upwards, leading to an improvement in her metabolic rate and skin perfusion.

pale_pallor_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Myocardial Infarction (Cardiogenic Shock)
  presenting_complaint: Crushing chest pain and diaphoresis
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male smoker presented to A&E with sudden onset retrosternal chest pain, appearing ashen-pale and drenched in sweat. An ECG showed ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V6, and his blood pressure was 88/50mmHg. He underwent emergency primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left anterior descending artery and required intra-aortic balloon pump support for 48 hours.

pale_pallor_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Beta-Thalassaemia Major
  presenting_complaint: Failure to thrive and marked pallor
  summary_of_course: An 18-month-old boy of Mediterranean descent presented with poor feeding, abdominal distension, and severe pallor.

He was commenced on a lifelong monthly blood transfusion programme and iron chelation therapy with deferasirox.

pale_pallor_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Lead Poisoning
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal pain and developmental delay
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old boy living in a Victorian-era house undergoing renovation presented with irritability, constipation, and a pale complexion.

  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female presented with a "lemon-yellow" tint to her pale skin and a smooth, red tongue (glossitis). Gastric parietal cell and intrinsic factor antibodies were positive, confirming pernicious anaemia. She responded well to parenteral B12 replacement, though she required long-term monitoring for gastric adenocarcinoma due to associated atrophic gastritis.

pale_pallor_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Anorexia Nervosa
  presenting_complaint: Amenorrhoea and fainting episodes
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female student was referred to the eating disorder clinic with a BMI of 14.2 and a very pale, lanugo-covered appearance.

  primary_diagnosis: Post-partum haemorrhage
  presenting_complaint: Excessive vaginal bleeding following delivery
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old G1P1 female became acutely pale and tachycardic 20 minutes after a normal vaginal delivery. Estimated blood loss was 1.5 litres due to uterine atony; she was managed with bimanual compression, intravenous oxytocin, and ergometrine. She received three units of cross-matched blood and made a full recovery with a discharge haemoglobin of 102g/L.

  presenting_complaint: High fever and rigors following travel
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male returned from a three-week trip to Nigeria and presented with cyclical fevers and a greyish-pale complexion. A thick and thin blood film showed a 5% parasitaemia of P. falciparum. He was treated with intravenous artesunate for severe malaria complicated by haemolysis, requiring close monitoring of his renal function and haematocrit.

pale_pallor_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath and easy bruising
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old male presented with a chronic, progressive pallor and exertional dyspnoea over twelve months. Bone marrow aspirate showed dysplastic changes in two cell lines and 4% blasts, consistent with MDS-MLD. Given his age and comorbidities, he was managed with supportive care, including regular erythropoietin injections and occasional red cell transfusions to maintain a target Hb of 90g/L.

pale_pallor_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Dark urine and sudden pallor
  summary_of_course: An 11-year-old boy of Middle Eastern descent presented with sudden onset jaundice and pallor 48 hours after consuming fava beans. Laboratory findings showed a Coombs-negative haemolytic anaemia with "bite cells" and Heinz bodies on the blood film. The acute episode resolved with hydration and avoidance of oxidative triggers, and his G6PD enzyme activity was later confirmed to be low.

  primary_diagnosis: Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)
  presenting_complaint: Bleeding from venepuncture sites
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female was admitted to the ICU with meningococcal septicaemia and rapidly progressing purpura fulminans. She was profoundly pale with cold extremities and evidence of multi-organ failure. DIC was diagnosed based on a high D-dimer, low fibrinogen, and prolonged PT/APTT; she required aggressive replacement of platelets, fresh frozen plasma, and cryoprecipitate alongside intensive antibiotic therapy.
