nephrogenic_diabetes_insipidus_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
  presenting_complaint: Failure to thrive, recurrent fevers, and extreme irritability.
  summary_of_course: A 6-month-old male infant presented with severe hypernatraemic dehydration (sodium 158 mmol/L) and poor weight gain. Despite adequate fluid intake, urine osmolality remained low at 110 mOsm/kg with no response to exogenous desmopressin. Genetic testing confirmed an AVPR2 mutation, and the patient was managed with a low-solute diet, thiazide diuretics, and amiloride.

nephrogenic_diabetes_insipidus_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
  presenting_complaint: Polyuria and polydipsia of 6 litres per day.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female with a 15-year history of lithium therapy for bipolar disorder reported worsening nocturia and thirst. Water deprivation testing showed a failure to concentrate urine above 250 mOsm/kg after DDAVP administration. Lithium was tapered under psychiatric supervision, and amiloride was commenced to block lithium entry into the collecting duct cells, resulting in a moderate reduction in urine volume.

nephrogenic_diabetes_insipidus_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypercalcaemia-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
  presenting_complaint: Acute confusion and excessive urination.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with known squamous cell lung carcinoma presented with a serum calcium of 3.6 mmol/L and acute polyuria. The hypercalcaemia caused down-regulation of aquaporin-2 channels, leading to secondary NDI. Symptoms resolved following aggressive intravenous hydration and bisphosphonate therapy to normalise calcium levels.

nephrogenic_diabetes_insipidus_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-obstructive nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
  presenting_complaint: Massive diuresis following catheterisation for urinary retention.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with benign prostatic hyperplasia underwent emergency catheterisation for acute-on-chronic retention, yielding 1.5L of urine. He subsequently developed a profound polyuria of 800ml/hour due to transient tubular insensitivity to ADH. He required meticulous fluid replacement with 0.45% saline to match losses and prevent life-threatening hypernatraemia during the recovery phase.

nephrogenic_diabetes_insipidus_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Sickle cell trait-associated nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
  presenting_complaint: Chronic mild polyuria and inability to concentrate urine during exercise.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male with sickle cell trait (HbAS) presented with exertional dehydration. Investigations revealed hyposthenuria (fixed low urine specific gravity) due to vasa recta sickling and papillary infarcts impairing the medullary concentration gradient. He was managed with education on proactive hydration and avoidance of extreme physical stress.

nephrogenic_diabetes_insipidus_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Sjögren's syndrome-related nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
  presenting_complaint: Persistent thirst and dry mouth.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female with Sjögren's syndrome and tubulointerstitial nephritis developed subacute polyuria. Renal biopsy showed lymphocytic infiltration, and water deprivation testing confirmed NDI. Treatment with corticosteroids for the underlying interstitial nephritis led to partial improvement in urinary concentrating ability.

nephrogenic_diabetes_insipidus_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic lithium-induced NDI
  presenting_complaint: Severe lethargy and polyuria following a viral illness.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old on long-term lithium developed gastroenteritis, leading to volume depletion and lithium toxicity (level 2.4 mmol/L). This exacerbated his underlying NDI, resulting in a sodium of 168 mmol/L and ICU admission. He required emergency haemodialysis to clear the lithium and slow correction of hypernatraemia with 5% dextrose.

nephrogenic_diabetes_insipidus_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypokalaemia-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
  presenting_complaint: Muscle weakness and increased urinary frequency.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female with chronic laxative abuse presented with a serum potassium of 2.1 mmol/L. The profound hypokalaemia induced a state of ADH resistance, evidenced by a low urine osmolality that failed to rise with desmopressin. Following aggressive potassium supplementation and cessation of laxatives, her urinary concentrating capacity returned to normal over two weeks.

nephrogenic_diabetes_insipidus_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Autosomal dominant nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
  presenting_complaint: Life-long polydipsia and mild polyuria.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female with a family history of "weak kidneys" presented for evaluation. Water deprivation testing showed a partial response to DDAVP, but urine osmolality remained sub-maximal at 400 mOsm/kg. Genetic testing identified a heterozygous mutation in the AQP2 gene, confirming a milder, adult-onset form of autosomal dominant NDI.

nephrogenic_diabetes_insipidus_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Amyloidosis-related nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
  presenting_complaint: Lower limb oedema and nocturia.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with systemic AL amyloidosis presented with nephrotic-range proteinuria and polyuria. Renal biopsy confirmed amyloid deposition in the medullary interstitium and collecting ducts, disrupting the osmotic gradient. Management focused on treating the underlying plasma cell dyscrasia while using salt restriction to manage polyuria.

nephrogenic_diabetes_insipidus_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Treatment-resistant congenital NDI
  presenting_complaint: Persistent severe polyuria despite standard therapy.
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old boy with known X-linked NDI continued to produce 5 litres of urine daily despite hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride. The addition of indomethacin (a prostaglandin inhibitor) was trialled to reduce glomerular filtration rate and increase proximal tubule reabsorption. This resulted in a 30% reduction in urine volume, though close monitoring for gastric irritation and renal impairment was required.

nephrogenic_diabetes_insipidus_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Partial nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (diagnostic challenge)
  presenting_complaint: Thirst and polyuria following head injury.
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male developed polyuria following a road traffic accident, raising suspicion of central DI. However, urine osmolality only rose from 150 to 320 mOsm/kg after 10mcg of intranasal desmopressin, suggesting a peripheral component or "washout" of the medullary gradient. Further testing after prolonged fluid restriction confirmed a partial NDI, likely exacerbated by excessive fluid resuscitation during his initial trauma care.

nephrogenic_diabetes_insipidus_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Autosomal recessive congenital NDI
  presenting_complaint: Severe neonatal dehydration and hypernatraemia.
  summary_of_course: A 2-week-old female infant born to consanguineous parents presented with a sodium of 162 mmol/L. Unlike the more common X-linked variety, genetic analysis revealed a homozygous mutation in the AQP2 gene. She required a high-volume, low-sodium formula and meticulous monitoring of her fluid balance to maintain growth and neurodevelopment.

nephrogenic_diabetes_insipidus_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Amphotericin B-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
  presenting_complaint: Polyuria during treatment for systemic candidiasis.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old neutropenic patient received a course of liposomal amphotericin B. He developed significant hypokalaemia and a rise in urine output to 5 litres/day with low urine osmolality. The drug-induced tubular toxicity caused a transient NDI which slowly resolved over three weeks following the cessation of the antifungal agent.

nephrogenic_diabetes_insipidus_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-acute tubular necrosis (ATN) nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
  presenting_complaint: Excessive urination during recovery from sepsis.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male in the diuretic phase of recovery from septic AKI developed polyuria exceeding 6 litres per day. Despite resolving creatinine levels, his tubules remained temporarily unresponsive to ADH. He was managed with free water access and monitored for electrolyte imbalances until tubular function fully matured after 10 days.

nephrogenic_diabetes_insipidus_016:
  primary_diagnosis: NDI in the setting of cognitive impairment
  presenting_complaint: Severe hypernatraemic dehydration and obtundation.
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old female with dementia and chronic lithium use for depression was admitted from a care home with a sodium of 172 mmol/L. She had lost the ability to communicate thirst or access water independently, leading to a life-threatening crisis. She was treated with a slow infusion of 5% dextrose and her lithium was permanently discontinued.

nephrogenic_diabetes_insipidus_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Ifosfamide-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
  presenting_complaint: Polyuria and glycosuria in a paediatric oncology patient.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy undergoing chemotherapy for osteosarcoma developed Fanconi syndrome and NDI symptoms. Ifosfamide metabolites caused damage to the distal tubules, resulting in ADH resistance. Management involved aggressive electrolyte replacement and the use of thiazides to reduce the free water clearance.

nephrogenic_diabetes_insipidus_018:
  primary_diagnosis: ADPKD-associated nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
  presenting_complaint: Early-onset nocturia and thirst.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) presented with significant nocturia despite a normal GFR. The architectural disruption of the renal medulla by expanding cysts interfered with the countercurrent multiplier system, causing an early NDI phenotype. He was advised on high fluid intake to suppress endogenous vasopressin, which may also slow cyst progression.

nephrogenic_diabetes_insipidus_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Demeclocycline-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
  presenting_complaint: New-onset polyuria during treatment for SIADH.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male with small cell lung cancer was treated for SIADH with demeclocycline. He subsequently developed excessive thirst and a urine output of 4.5 litres/day as the medication effectively induced a controlled state of NDI. The dose was titrated downwards to achieve a balance between preventing hyponatraemia and avoiding symptomatic polyuria.

nephrogenic_diabetes_insipidus_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Partial NDI secondary to chronic pyelonephritis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent urinary tract infections and mild polyuria.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female with a history of recurrent childhood pyelonephritis and renal scarring presented with mild polydipsia. Investigations showed a reduced maximum urinary concentrating ability (450 mOsm/kg) consistent with partial NDI due to medullary scarring. No specific treatment was required other than ensuring adequate fluid intake during periods of illness.
