  primary_diagnosis: Primary Adrenal Insufficiency (Addison's Disease)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive fatigue, weight loss, and skin hyperpigmentation.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female presented with a six-month history of lethargy and 8kg weight loss. Clinical examination revealed hyperpigmentation of palmar creases and buccal mucosa. Investigations showed hyponatraemia (128 mmol/L), hyperkalaemia (5.6 mmol/L), and a failed short Synacthen test (peak cortisol 110 nmol/L). She was commenced on oral hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone with significant symptomatic improvement.

adrenocortical_insufficiency_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Adrenal Crisis
  presenting_complaint: Severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and profound hypotension.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male with known Addison's disease presented to A&E with a 24-hour history of gastroenteritis. He was found to be in shock (BP 75/40 mmHg) with metabolic acidosis and hypoglycaemia. He was treated urgently with IV boluses of 100mg hydrocortisone and aggressive fluid resuscitation. He was stabilised and transferred to the medical ward for monitoring and education on sick day rules.

  primary_diagnosis: Secondary Adrenal Insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Headaches, visual field defects, and generalized weakness.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male presented with bitemporal hemianopia and lethargy. MRI pituitary confirmed a 2.5cm macroadenoma compressing the optic chiasm. Endocrine workup revealed low morning cortisol (45 nmol/L) and inappropriately low ACTH (8 ng/L), confirming secondary insufficiency. He was started on hydrocortisone replacement prior to scheduled transsphenoidal resection.

adrenocortical_insufficiency_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic Adrenal Insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Myalgia, joint pain, and severe exhaustion after stopping steroids.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with COPD had been on long-term prednisolone (10mg daily) for six months and stopped it abruptly three days ago. She presented with "steroid withdrawal syndrome" including hypotension and severe malaise. A morning cortisol was suppressed at 20 nmol/L. She was restarted on a tapering dose of prednisolone to allow for HPA axis recovery.

adrenocortical_insufficiency_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Salt-Wasting Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)
  presenting_complaint: Poor feeding, vomiting, and ambiguous genitalia in a neonate.
  summary_of_course: A 10-day-old neonate (assigned female at birth) presented with failure to thrive and dehydration. Biochemistry revealed Na 120 mmol/L and K 7.2 mmol/L. Genetic testing confirmed 21-hydroxylase deficiency with markedly elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone. The infant was stabilised with IV fluids, hydrocortisone, and fludrocortisone in the neonatal ICU.

adrenocortical_insufficiency_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Waterhouse-Friderichsen Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Fever, non-blanching purpuric rash, and rapid collapse.
  summary_of_course: An 18-year-old male student presented with meningococcal septicaemia and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). He rapidly developed refractory shock despite vasopressors. CT abdomen showed bilateral adrenal haemorrhage. Despite intensive care support and high-dose IV corticosteroids, the patient unfortunately succumbed to multi-organ failure.

adrenocortical_insufficiency_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 2 (Schmidt Syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Dizziness and worsening glycaemic control in a known diabetic.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female with Type 1 Diabetes and Hashimoto's thyroiditis reported frequent unexplained hypoglycaemic episodes and salt craving.

  primary_diagnosis: X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD)
  presenting_complaint: Behavioural changes and skin darkening in a young boy.
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old boy was referred by his GP for hyperpigmentation and declining school performance. Neurological assessment showed gait ataxia, while endocrine tests confirmed primary adrenal insufficiency. Plasma very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) levels were elevated, confirming X-ALD. He was started on adrenal replacement therapy and referred to paediatric neurology for monitoring of cerebral involvement.

adrenocortical_insufficiency_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Metastatic Adrenal Destruction
  presenting_complaint: Weight loss, anorexia, and persistent hyponatraemia.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male with known metastatic small cell lung cancer presented with worsening confusion and weakness. CT imaging showed bilateral bulky adrenal metastases. A short Synacthen test confirmed adrenal insufficiency (peak cortisol 140 nmol/L). Palliative treatment with low-dose dexamethasone improved his energy levels and appetite.

adrenocortical_insufficiency_010:
  primary_diagnosis: TB-related Adrenal Insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Chronic cough, night sweats, and postural dizziness.
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old male recently arrived from a high-prevalence TB area presented with constitutional symptoms. Sputum cultures were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Imaging revealed enlarged, calcified adrenal glands. He was diagnosed with TB-adrenalitis causing primary insufficiency and commenced on quadruple antituberculous therapy alongside steroid replacement.

adrenocortical_insufficiency_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-induced Hypophysitis
  presenting_complaint: Severe headache and profound lethargy.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male undergoing Pembrolizumab treatment for metastatic melanoma developed sudden onset fatigue. Endocrine screening showed low TSH and low morning cortisol with low ACTH. MRI pituitary showed mild infundibular thickening consistent with drug-induced hypophysitis. He required permanent secondary adrenal and thyroid hormone replacement.

adrenocortical_insufficiency_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Bilateral Adrenal Haemorrhage (Anticoagulation-related)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset severe flank pain and hypotension.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male on Warfarin for atrial fibrillation presented with acute abdominal pain and a drop in haemoglobin. CT scan revealed large bilateral adrenal haematomas. He developed acute adrenal insufficiency requiring immediate IV hydrocortisone. His anticoagulation was reversed, and he was transitioned to long-term oral steroid replacement.

adrenocortical_insufficiency_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Isolated ACTH Deficiency
  presenting_complaint: Non-specific malaise and recurrent infections.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female presented with a two-year history of "feeling unwell" but no hyperpigmentation or electrolyte imbalance. An insulin tolerance test (ITT) demonstrated a failed cortisol response and blunted ACTH rise, while other pituitary axes were intact. This rare case of isolated ACTH deficiency was treated with hydrocortisone, resulting in a complete resolution of symptoms.

adrenocortical_insufficiency_014:
  primary_diagnosis: HIV-associated Adrenal Insufficiency (CMV Adrenalitis)
  presenting_complaint: Wasting, fever, and low blood pressure.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old male with advanced HIV (CD4 count <50) presented with refractory hypotension. Investigations for opportunistic infections identified Cytomegalovirus (CMV) in the blood. Adrenal function testing confirmed primary insufficiency, likely due to CMV adrenalitis. He was treated with Ganciclovir and hydrocortisone, though his prognosis remained guarded due to systemic viraemia.

adrenocortical_insufficiency_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Relative Adrenal Insufficiency in Septic Shock
  presenting_complaint: Hypotension unresponsive to fluid resuscitation and vasopressors.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female was admitted to ICU with urosepsis. Despite high-dose noradrenaline, her mean arterial pressure remained below 60 mmHg. A random cortisol was 400 nmol/L, which was considered inappropriately low for a state of physiological stress. Following the administration of 50mg IV hydrocortisone every 6 hours, her vasopressor requirements rapidly decreased.

adrenocortical_insufficiency_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Pregnancy-masked Adrenal Insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Excessive vomiting and syncope in the first trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old pregnant female was initially treated for hyperemesis gravidarum. However, persistent hyponatraemia and postural hypotension prompted a Synacthen test, which revealed Addison's disease. Management was complicated by the need to adjust hydrocortisone doses throughout the trimesters and provide parenteral coverage during labour.

adrenocortical_insufficiency_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Etomidate-induced Adrenal Suppression
  presenting_complaint: Post-intubation cardiovascular instability.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old trauma patient was intubated in the emergency department using Etomidate as an induction agent. In the following 12 hours, he exhibited unexpected haemodynamic instability. Recognition of Etomidate's inhibitory effect on 11-beta-hydroxylase led to the administration of supplemental hydrocortisone, which stabilised his blood pressure.

adrenocortical_insufficiency_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Subclinical Adrenal Insufficiency (Early stage)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic fatigue and mild orthostatic dizziness.
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old female athlete complained of reduced performance and lightheadedness. Initial electrolytes and morning cortisol (320 nmol/L) were normal, but she was positive for 21-hydroxylase antibodies. A repeat Synacthen test six months later showed a suboptimal peak of 380 nmol/L, indicating early-stage autoimmune adrenalitis. She was started on a low-dose hydrocortisone trial with symptomatic benefit.

adrenocortical_insufficiency_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-Adrenalectomy Adrenal Insufficiency
  presenting_complaint: Nausea and weakness following surgery for Cushing's Syndrome.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female underwent unilateral adrenalectomy for a cortisol-secreting adenoma. Post-operatively, the contralateral gland remained suppressed due to long-term feedback inhibition. She required temporary hydrocortisone replacement for 12 months until the remaining adrenal gland recovered sufficient function, confirmed by a normal Synacthen test.

adrenocortical_insufficiency_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Adrenal Insufficiency secondary to Sarcoidosis
  presenting_complaint: Dyspnoea, skin lesions, and extreme tiredness.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with known pulmonary sarcoidosis presented with new-onset hyperpigmentation and hypotension. CT thorax and abdomen showed hilar lymphadenopathy and enlarged, nodular adrenal glands. Adrenal biopsy confirmed non-caseating granulomas. He was treated with high-dose prednisolone, which addressed both the sarcoidosis activity and the adrenal insufficiency.
