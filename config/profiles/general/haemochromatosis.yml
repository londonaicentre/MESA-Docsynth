haemochromatosis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Hereditary haemochromatosis (C282Y homozygote)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic fatigue and bilateral finger joint pain
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male presented with a 12-month history of lethargy and arthralgia affecting the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints. Investigations revealed a ferritin of 1,250 μg/L and transferrin saturation of 82%, with genetic testing confirming C282Y homozygosity. He commenced weekly venesection, achieving a target ferritin of 50 μg/L within nine months with significant improvement in fatigue.

haemochromatosis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Bronze diabetes secondary to haemochromatosis
  presenting_complaint: New-onset polyuria, polydipsia, and skin hyperpigmentation
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old post-menopausal female presented with symptoms of hyperglycaemia and a distinct metallic grey skin tone. Laboratory tests showed an HbA1c of 78 mmol/mol and a ferritin of 3,400 μg/L, while an MRI Liver Multi-organ Iron study confirmed severe hepatic and pancreatic siderosis. She was managed with insulin therapy and aggressive venesection to mitigate further end-organ damage.

haemochromatosis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Juvenile haemochromatosis (HJV mutation)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive dyspnoea and palpitations
  summary_of_course: An 18-year-old male presented with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III heart failure symptoms and supraventricular tachycardia. Echocardiography demonstrated a restrictive cardiomyopathy, and genetic analysis identified a homozygous HJV mutation. Due to the severity of cardiac iron overload (MRI T2* <10ms), he was started on urgent continuous intravenous desferrioxamine chelation.

haemochromatosis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary haemochromatosis (Transfusional iron overload)
  presenting_complaint: Routine monitoring in a patient with Beta-thalassaemia major
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female with a lifelong transfusion requirement (over 100 units) presented for annual review. Her ferritin had risen to 4,200 μg/L despite oral chelation, and FibroScan indicated advanced fibrosis (F3). Her chelation regimen was intensified from deferasirox monotherapy to a combination with deferiprone to protect her hepatic and cardiac function.

haemochromatosis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic liver failure in haemochromatosis
  presenting_complaint: Jaundice, abdominal swelling, and confusion
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with known but poorly managed haemochromatosis and comorbid alcohol misuse presented with decompensated cirrhosis. Clinical examination revealed icterus, ascites, and Grade II hepatic encephalopathy. Despite intensive supportive care in the high dependency unit, his condition deteriorated due to hepatorenal syndrome, highlighting the risk of synergistic liver injury.

haemochromatosis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Haemochromatosis-associated arthropathy
  presenting_complaint: Severe "iron fist" deformity and chronic hand pain
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female presented with characteristic hook-like osteophytes on hand X-rays and inability to fully extend her fingers. Although her systemic iron stores were only moderately elevated (ferritin 600 μg/L), her transferrin saturation was persistently >75%. While venesection stabilised her iron levels, her arthropathy remained progressive, requiring specialist rheumatological intervention and analgesia.

haemochromatosis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Restrictive cardiomyopathy secondary to iron overload
  presenting_complaint: Syncope and peripheral oedema
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male was admitted following a syncopal episode, with ECG showing atrial fibrillation and right bundle branch block. Investigations revealed a ferritin of 2,100 μg/L and significant myocardial iron deposition on MRI. He was stabilised with diuretics and rate control, and long-term venesection was initiated to reduce the total body iron burden.

haemochromatosis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to haemochromatosis
  presenting_complaint: Loss of libido and erectile dysfunction
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male presented to his GP with endocrine symptoms and low mood. Biochemical screening showed low testosterone (4.2 nmol/L) with inappropriately low LH and FSH, while a subsequent iron panel showed a ferritin of 1,850 μg/L. Pituitary MRI confirmed iron deposition in the anterior pituitary, and he was commenced on both testosterone replacement and a venesection programme.

haemochromatosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic Hereditary Haemochromatosis
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding on routine health screening
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old male underwent blood tests for an insurance medical, which revealed an incidental ferritin of 850 μg/L. Genetic testing confirmed he was a C282Y/H63D compound heterozygote. As he was asymptomatic with normal LFTs and no evidence of fibrosis, he was started on maintenance venesection every three months to prevent future complications.

haemochromatosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Ferroportin disease (Type 4 Haemochromatosis)
  presenting_complaint: High ferritin with normal transferrin saturation
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male was referred with a persistently high ferritin of 1,100 μg/L but a normal transferrin saturation of 35%. Genetic testing for HFE mutations was negative, but an SLC40A1 mutation was identified, confirming Ferroportin disease. Unlike classic HH, he showed a tendency towards mild anaemia during venesection, requiring a more cautious, less frequent phlebotomy schedule.

haemochromatosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Neonatal haemochromatosis (GALD)
  presenting_complaint: Fulminant hepatic failure in a 3-day-old neonate
  summary_of_course: A newborn presented with severe coagulopathy, hypoglycaemia, and hyperbilirubinaemia shortly after birth. An MRI showed extrahepatic iron in the pancreas, and a salivary gland biopsy confirmed siderosis, consistent with gestational alloimmune liver disease (GALD). The infant was treated urgently with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and double-volume exchange transfusion.

haemochromatosis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent iron overload post-liver transplant
  presenting_complaint: Rising ferritin levels following transplantation
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male, who received a liver transplant five years ago for haemochromatosis-related hepatocellular carcinoma, showed a steady rise in ferritin to 900 μg/L. Investigation confirmed that the underlying genetic drive for hyperabsorption remained, leading to iron accumulation in the graft. He was restarted on a maintenance venesection schedule to protect the donor organ.

haemochromatosis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Haemochromatosis with venesection intolerance
  presenting_complaint: Severe anxiety and vasovagal syncope during phlebotomy
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female with a ferritin of 1,500 μg/L and difficult venous access experienced repeated syncopal episodes during attempted venesection. Despite trying various distraction techniques and local anaesthesia, she remained unable to tolerate the procedure. She was transitioned to oral iron chelation with deferasirox as an alternative method to reduce her iron stores.

haemochromatosis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Haemochromatosis masked by Chronic Kidney Disease
  presenting_complaint: Lethargy in an elderly patient with multiple comorbidities
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with Stage 4 CKD and heart failure presented with worsening fatigue. His ferritin was 950 μg/L, initially attributed to the anaemia of chronic disease; however, a transferrin saturation of 90% prompted HFE testing, which was positive. Due to his frailty and borderline haemoglobin, he was managed with small-volume (250ml) venesections every month under close monitoring.

haemochromatosis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Porphyria Cutanea Tarda (PCT) associated with HH
  presenting_complaint: Blistering skin lesions on the dorsum of the hands
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male presented with fragile skin and painful blisters following sun exposure. Clinical suspicion of PCT was confirmed by elevated urinary porphyrins, and subsequent screening revealed underlying C282Y homozygosity. Venesection served a dual purpose, successfully treating both the PCT skin manifestations and the systemic iron overload.

haemochromatosis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Vibrio vulnificus septicaemia in undiagnosed HH
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressive cellulitis and septic shock
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male presented in septic shock 24 hours after consuming raw oysters. Blood cultures grew Vibrio vulnificus, an iron-seeking pathogen, and subsequent investigations revealed an undiagnosed ferritin of 2,800 μg/L. He required ICU admission for vasopressor support and surgical debridement, with haemochromatosis identified as the primary predisposing factor for the fulminant infection.

haemochromatosis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Non-HFE Haemochromatosis (TfR2 mutation)
  presenting_complaint: Early-onset liver enzyme derangement
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old female was investigated for persistently elevated ALT and AST. HFE genetic testing was negative, but a broader iron overload gene panel identified a mutation in the Transferrin Receptor 2 (TfR2) gene. MRI quantification showed moderate hepatic iron (LIC 7.5 mg/g dw), and she was successfully managed with bi-weekly venesection.

haemochromatosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) complicating HH
  presenting_complaint: Right upper quadrant pain and unexplained weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with a 20-year history of haemochromatosis-related cirrhosis presented with new abdominal pain. An alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was significantly elevated at 450 ng/mL, and a triple-phase CT scan identified a 4cm hypervascular lesion in segment VII of the liver. He was referred to the hepatobiliary multidisciplinary team for consideration of radiofrequency ablation.

haemochromatosis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Haemochromatosis in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Management of known HH during second trimester
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old pregnant female with known HH was monitored closely by her obstetrician and haematologist. Her ferritin levels naturally declined from 400 μg/L to 150 μg/L by the third trimester due to the high iron demands of the foetus and expanded maternal blood volume. Venesection was suspended during the pregnancy and resumed six months postpartum after her iron levels began to rise again.

haemochromatosis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Neuropsychiatric presentation of haemochromatosis
  presenting_complaint: Severe "brain fog", depression, and cognitive slowing
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female was referred to psychiatry for treatment-resistant depression and cognitive difficulties. A routine metabolic screen included an iron panel, which showed a ferritin of 950 μg/L and a transferrin saturation of 88%. Following the initiation of venesection and the reduction of her iron stores, she reported a significant improvement in her mental clarity and mood, suggesting a metabolic component to her psychiatric symptoms.
