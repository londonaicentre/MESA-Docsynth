recurrent_falls_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Orthostatic hypotension secondary to polypharmacy
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent dizzy spells and three falls in the last month when standing up.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with hypertension and heart failure presented after falling in her kitchen. Lying and standing blood pressure readings showed a 25mmHg drop in systolic pressure upon standing. Her medications, including amlodipine and furosemide, were reviewed and adjusted, resulting in a significant reduction in postural symptoms and no further falls at six-week follow-up.

recurrent_falls_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Parkinson's disease with freezing of gait
  presenting_complaint: Frequent "tripping" and inability to move feet forward, leading to multiple forward falls.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with a 5-year history of Parkinson's disease reported daily episodes of freezing, particularly in doorways. Clinical examination revealed a shuffling gait and postural instability. Optimisation of levodopa therapy and referral to a specialist neuro-physiotherapist for cueing strategies improved his mobility and reduced fall frequency.

recurrent_falls_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Ataxic cerebral palsy
  presenting_complaint: Paediatric patient with persistent unsteadiness and frequent tumbles since starting to walk.
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old girl was referred to the paediatric gait clinic due to recurrent falls at school. MRI brain showed cerebellar hypoplasia, and multidisciplinary assessment confirmed ataxic cerebral palsy. She was managed with orthotics (AFOs) and a tailored physical education programme, leading to improved balance and confidence.

recurrent_falls_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcohol-related cerebellar degeneration
  presenting_complaint: Chronic instability and recurrent falls, often resulting in facial bruising.
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old male with long-term alcohol dependency presented with a wide-based gait and truncal ataxia. CT head showed marked cerebellar atrophy. Despite abstinence and high-dose thiamine (Pabrinex), his gait remained impaired, requiring a long-term walking frame and community occupational therapy input for home safety.

recurrent_falls_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe frailty syndrome and sarcopenia
  presenting_complaint: Generalised weakness and multiple "slips" in the bedroom over the last six months.
  summary_of_course: An 89-year-old female living alone was found to have a Rockwood Frailty Score of 7. Investigations revealed Vitamin D deficiency (20 nmol/L) and significant muscle wasting. Treatment included Vitamin D loading, a high-protein diet, and a community strength and balance programme, which stabilised her condition.

recurrent_falls_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Sick Sinus Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Sudden blackouts without warning, occurring twice in the last week.
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old male was admitted to the syncope unit after a fall resulting in a Colles' fracture. A 24-hour Holter monitor captured a 4.2-second sinus pause during a symptomatic episode. He underwent permanent dual-chamber pacemaker insertion, with complete resolution of his syncopal falls.

recurrent_falls_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS)
  presenting_complaint: Subacute onset of leg weakness and "dragging" of the left foot leading to falls.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female presented with a three-week history of worsening mobility. Examination showed increased tone and clonus in the lower limbs. MRI showed new demyelinating lesions, and she was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone for an MS relapse, followed by a transition to disease-modifying therapy.

recurrent_falls_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Vascular dementia with visuospatial impairment
  presenting_complaint: Frequent falls in the care home, particularly at night.
  summary_of_course: An 84-year-old male with known vascular dementia was falling 3-4 times weekly. Assessment suggested poor depth perception and "sundowning" behaviour. Environmental modifications, including improved lighting and floor sensors, along with a cataract extraction, reduced his fall rate by 60%.

recurrent_falls_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)
  presenting_complaint: Acute episodes of room-spinning dizziness triggered by head movement, causing two falls.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male presented to A&E after falling while getting out of bed. A positive Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre confirmed right-sided posterior canal BPPV. He was successfully treated with an Epley manoeuvre in the clinic and remained symptom-free at his two-week review.

recurrent_falls_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Loss of balance and "numb feet" resulting in frequent stumbles in the dark.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with Type 2 Diabetes for 20 years reported several near-misses and one fall. Examination showed a "stocking" distribution of sensory loss and absent ankle jerks. He was provided with podiatry-approved footwear and advised on visual compensation techniques for balance, preventing further injury.

recurrent_falls_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-stroke hemispatial neglect
  presenting_complaint: Repeatedly bumping into objects on the left side and falling.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female, three months post-right MCA stroke, was struggling with community mobility. Despite good motor recovery, she consistently failed to notice obstacles in her left visual field. Targeted occupational therapy for spatial awareness and "scanning" significantly improved her safety and reduced falls.

recurrent_falls_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH)
  presenting_complaint: The "triad" of worsening gait, urinary incontinence, and cognitive decline over 12 months.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male was referred to neurology for "magnetic gait" and recurrent falls. MRI showed ventriculomegaly out of proportion to sulcal atrophy. Following a successful lumbar drain trial which improved his walking speed, he underwent ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting with marked improvement.

recurrent_falls_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic sedation secondary to benzodiazepine use
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of daytime somnolence and unsteadiness leading to a hip fracture.
  summary_of_course: An 81-year-old female was admitted with a neck of femur fracture after falling at 10 AM. History revealed she had recently started nitrazepam for insomnia. The medication was identified as the primary cause of her ataxia and falls; it was tapered and stopped post-operatively, and she was transitioned to non-pharmacological sleep hygiene.

recurrent_falls_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe knee osteoarthritis with joint instability
  presenting_complaint: Chronic knee pain and the joint "giving way," causing frequent falls.
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old male with bilateral knee osteoarthritis reported his right knee frequently buckled during weight-bearing. X-rays showed Grade 4 Kellgren-Lawrence changes. After failing conservative management with physiotherapy, he underwent a total knee replacement, which restored joint stability and eliminated the falls.

recurrent_falls_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Myasthenia Gravis
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent leg weakness and falls that worsen towards the end of the day.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented with fatiguable weakness and ptosis. She had experienced three falls in the last month, always in the evening. Positive anti-AChR antibodies and decremental response on EMG confirmed the diagnosis; treatment with pyridostigmine and prednisolone resolved her weakness and falls.

recurrent_falls_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Aortic Stenosis
  presenting_complaint: Exertional lightheadedness and two episodes of collapse while walking uphill.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male reported recurrent "drop attacks" during physical activity. Echocardiography revealed a calcified aortic valve with an area of 0.7cm2 and a mean gradient of 50mmHg. He was referred for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI), after which his exertional symptoms and falls ceased.

recurrent_falls_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)
  presenting_complaint: 8-year-old boy with progressive difficulty climbing stairs and frequent falls.
  summary_of_course: A young boy was brought in by his parents due to a "waddling" gait and frequent tumbles. Clinical exam noted a positive Gowers' sign and pseudohypertrophy of the calves. Genetic testing confirmed a deletion in the DMD gene, and he was commenced on a multidisciplinary care plan including corticosteroids and physiotherapy.

recurrent_falls_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Functional Neurological Disorder (FND)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden "leg collapses" and falls without loss of consciousness, occurring multiple times daily.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female presented with dramatic falls that were not associated with prodromal symptoms or injury. Neurological examination showed Hoover’s sign and inconsistent gait patterns. After a diagnosis of FND was explained and accepted, she engaged in specialist physiotherapy, leading to a gradual reduction in fall frequency.

recurrent_falls_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent hypoglycaemia in Type 1 Diabetes
  presenting_complaint: Acute episodes of confusion and falling, typically occurring in the early morning.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male with T1DM was brought to A&E after a fall resulting in a head injury. Capillary blood glucose on arrival was 2.1 mmol/L. Review of his continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data showed frequent nocturnal hypoglycaemia; his insulin pump settings were adjusted, and he received further carbohydrate counting education.

recurrent_falls_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Hyperactive delirium secondary to Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)
  presenting_complaint: Acute confusion, agitation, and three falls within 24 hours of hospital admission.
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old female was admitted for a suspected UTI. She became acutely confused, attempted to climb out of bed repeatedly, and fell twice in the ward. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics (nitrofurantoin) and implementation of a 1-to-1 "special" nursing observation resolved the delirium and prevented further falls.
