minimal_change_disease_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic Minimal Change Disease
  presenting_complaint: Periorbital oedema and frothy urine
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old male presented with a 5-day history of worsening facial swelling and abdominal distension. Urinalysis showed 4+ protein with a urine protein-creatinine ratio (uPCR) of 950 mg/mmol and serum albumin of 18 g/L. He was started on oral prednisolone (60 mg/m2) and achieved complete remission within 10 days, consistent with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome.

minimal_change_disease_002:
  primary_diagnosis: NSAID-induced Minimal Change Disease
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral leg swelling and weight gain
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female with chronic back pain reported a 2-week history of pitting oedema after increasing ibuprofen use. Investigations revealed nephrotic-range proteinuria (8.2 g/24h) and normal renal function, with biopsy confirming podocyte foot process effacement without interstitial nephritis. Discontinuation of NSAIDs and a short course of corticosteroids led to a full resolution of symptoms and proteinuria.

minimal_change_disease_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Minimal Change Disease with Acute Kidney Injury
  presenting_complaint: Severe anasarca and oliguria
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male presented to A&E with gross peripheral oedema and a reduced urine output over 48 hours. Laboratory tests showed an albumin of 14 g/L and a creatinine rise from 80 to 245 µmol/L, necessitating hospital admission for intravenous furosemide and high-dose steroids. Renal biopsy confirmed MCD with acute tubular necrosis; he recovered baseline renal function following prolonged steroid therapy.

minimal_change_disease_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Steroid-dependent Minimal Change Disease
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent swelling on steroid tapering
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old girl, previously diagnosed with MCD, presented with her third relapse in 12 months, occurring each time the prednisolone dose dropped below 10 mg. Despite initial responses, the frequent relapses necessitated the introduction of Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) as a steroid-sparing agent. She successfully achieved sustained remission on MMF, allowing for the complete withdrawal of corticosteroids.

minimal_change_disease_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Paraneoplastic Minimal Change Disease
  presenting_complaint: Generalised oedema and cervical lymphadenopathy
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented with nephrotic syndrome and palpable neck nodes. Biopsy of a lymph node confirmed Hodgkin Lymphoma, while a concurrent renal biopsy showed MCD. Treatment of the underlying lymphoma with ABVD chemotherapy resulted in rapid disappearance of proteinuria, confirming a paraneoplastic association.

minimal_change_disease_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Steroid-resistant Minimal Change Disease
  presenting_complaint: Persistent proteinuria despite 8 weeks of prednisolone
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old boy failed to achieve remission after a standard 8-week course of daily prednisolone. A renal biopsy was performed to exclude FSGS but confirmed MCD with extensive foot process effacement. He was subsequently started on Ciclosporin, which successfully induced remission after 4 weeks of therapy.

minimal_change_disease_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Minimal Change Disease complicated by Pulmonary Embolism
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset pleuritic chest pain and leg swelling
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female with undiagnosed nephrotic syndrome (albumin 12 g/L, uPCR 1200 mg/mmol) presented acutely with breathlessness. CTPA confirmed bilateral pulmonary emboli, attributed to the hypercoagulable state of MCD. She was managed with anticoagulation and high-dose steroids, with proteinuria resolving over three weeks.

minimal_change_disease_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Minimal Change Disease in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Rapid onset hypertension and proteinuria at 24 weeks gestation
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old pregnant woman was initially suspected of having early-onset pre-eclampsia due to heavy proteinuria and mild hypertension. However, the absence of other pre-eclampsia features and a very low albumin prompted a renal biopsy, which revealed MCD. She was managed with prednisolone and delivered a healthy infant at 37 weeks, with postpartum resolution of renal symptoms.

minimal_change_disease_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Minimal Change Disease with Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal pain, fever, and ascites
  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old child with known MCD presented to the paediatric assessment unit with acute abdominal pain and pyrexia. Ascitic fluid culture grew Streptococcus pneumoniae, confirming SBP as a complication of his nephrotic state. He was treated with intravenous cefotaxime and albumin infusions alongside an increase in his steroid dose.

minimal_change_disease_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Minimal Change Disease triggered by Vaccination
  presenting_complaint: Frothy urine and eyelid swelling 3 days after influenza vaccine
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with no prior medical history developed sudden onset nephrotic syndrome shortly after receiving a seasonal flu jab. Investigations showed uPCR 880 mg/mmol and normal serum creatinine. He responded rapidly to a 4-week course of prednisolone, suggesting an immune-mediated trigger for his MCD.

minimal_change_disease_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Relapsing Minimal Change Disease
  presenting_complaint: Recurrence of leg swelling following an upper respiratory tract infection
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female with a history of MCD in childhood presented with her first adult relapse following a viral sore throat. Her uPCR was 650 mg/mmol and albumin was 22 g/L. She was recommenced on prednisolone 1mg/kg, achieving complete remission within two weeks, and followed a tapering schedule over 6 months.

minimal_change_disease_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Minimal Change Disease with Hyperlipidaemia
  presenting_complaint: Severe xanthomata and peripheral oedema
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male presented with profound nephrotic syndrome and eruptive xanthomata. Laboratory results showed a total cholesterol of 15.2 mmol/L and triglycerides of 6.4 mmol/L, alongside an albumin of 16 g/L. While steroids addressed the underlying MCD, he required temporary statin therapy to manage the extreme hyperlipidaemia until remission was achieved.

minimal_change_disease_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Minimal Change Disease presenting as Anaphylactoid reaction
  presenting_complaint: Facial swelling and urticaria
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female was initially treated in the ED for suspected allergy due to facial puffiness and a rash. When the swelling failed to respond to antihistamines and was noted to be non-pruritic, urinalysis revealed 4+ protein. Renal biopsy confirmed MCD, and the "rash" was determined to be atypical skin changes associated with severe hypoproteinaemia.

minimal_change_disease_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Minimal Change Disease with Steroid-Induced Psychosis
  presenting_complaint: Acute confusion and agitation during MCD treatment
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male started on 60mg prednisolone for biopsy-proven MCD developed severe psychiatric symptoms within 7 days. He required admission to a mental health unit and a rapid steroid taper. Rituximab was initiated as an alternative first-line agent, which successfully induced renal remission without further psychiatric sequelae.

minimal_change_disease_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Minimal Change Disease with Cellulitis
  presenting_complaint: Red, hot, swollen lower leg and systemic malaise
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female with undiagnosed MCD presented with severe cellulitis of the right calf. The underlying nephrotic oedema (albumin 19 g/L) had predisposed her to skin breakdown and infection. She required IV antibiotics for the cellulitis and subsequent steroid therapy for the MCD, with both resolving over a two-week hospital stay.

minimal_change_disease_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Minimal Change Disease with IgA Deposition (Edge Case)
  presenting_complaint: Visible haematuria and nephrotic syndrome
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male presented with atypical features for MCD, including macroscopic haematuria. Renal biopsy showed foot process effacement typical of MCD but also mild mesangial IgA deposits. He was treated for MCD with steroids and achieved complete remission of the nephrotic syndrome, suggesting the IgA was an incidental finding or a rare overlap.

minimal_change_disease_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Frequently Relapsing Minimal Change Disease
  presenting_complaint: Fourth episode of oedema in 12 months
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy experienced multiple relapses of MCD despite initially being steroid-sensitive. Due to the high cumulative steroid dose and signs of Cushingoid features, he was treated with a single dose of Rituximab (375 mg/m2). This resulted in a prolonged remission of over 18 months without the need for further maintenance therapy.

minimal_change_disease_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Minimal Change Disease with Severe Hypovolaemia
  presenting_complaint: Dizziness, tachycardia, and abdominal pain
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old girl with acute-onset nephrotic syndrome presented with signs of intravascular volume depletion despite significant peripheral oedema. Her blood pressure was 85/50 mmHg and she had a compensated metabolic acidosis. She required cautious volume expansion with 20% human albumin solution before commencing steroid therapy for her biopsy-confirmed MCD.

minimal_change_disease_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Minimal Change Disease in an Elderly Patient
  presenting_complaint: New-onset heart failure symptoms and proteinuria
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male was referred to cardiology for suspected heart failure due to bilateral leg oedema and breathlessness. Normal BNP levels and echocardiogram shifted focus to the kidneys, where a uPCR of 700 mg/mmol was found. Despite his age, he tolerated a modified course of oral prednisolone and achieved remission within 3 weeks.

minimal_change_disease_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Minimal Change Disease with Chronic Kidney Disease
  presenting_complaint: Worsening of baseline renal function and new-onset frothy urine
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old with stage 3b CKD secondary to hypertensive nephrosclerosis developed sudden nephrotic-range proteinuria. Biopsy showed MCD superimposed on chronic hypertensive changes (glomerulosclerosis 30%). He was treated with a cautious steroid regimen, which resolved the proteinuria but left his creatinine at a new baseline of 210 µmol/L.
