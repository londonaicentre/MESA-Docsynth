  primary_diagnosis: Insulinoma
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent episodes of confusion and diaphoresis relieved by eating
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female presented with symptomatic fasting hypoglycaemia (glucose 2.2 mmol/L). A supervised 72-hour fast confirmed endogenous hyperinsulinism, and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) localised a 1.2cm nodule in the pancreatic tail. The lesion was successfully enucleated laparoscopically, resulting in complete resolution of her neuroglycopenic symptoms.

benign_neoplasm_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Pleomorphic Adenoma
  presenting_complaint: Slowly enlarging, painless lump at the angle of the jaw
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female presented with a firm, mobile mass in the left parotid tail present for three years. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) was suggestive of a pleomorphic adenoma. She underwent a superficial parotidectomy with facial nerve monitoring, and histology confirmed a benign mixed tumour with clear margins.

benign_neoplasm_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Renal Angiomyolipoma
  presenting_complaint: Sudden flank pain and hypotension
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old female with known tuberous sclerosis presented in hypovolaemic shock with acute left-sided loin pain. CT angiography revealed a ruptured 12cm renal angiomyolipoma with a large retroperitoneal haematoma (Wunderlich syndrome).
