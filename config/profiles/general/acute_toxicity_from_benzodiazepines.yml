acute_toxicity_from_benzodiazepines_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute diazepam overdose
  presenting_complaint: Reduced level of consciousness and slurred speech
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female presented to A&E after intentionally ingesting 200mg of diazepam. On examination, GCS was 10 (E3, V3, M4) with stable haemodynamics and a respiratory rate of 12. She was managed with supportive care and intravenous fluids, regaining full consciousness after 18 hours of observation.

acute_toxicity_from_benzodiazepines_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Accidental paediatric alprazolam ingestion
  presenting_complaint: Ataxia and extreme somnolence
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old male was brought to the paediatric emergency department after ingesting an unknown quantity of his mother's Xanax (alprazolam). He was markedly ataxic and difficult to rouse, though his airway remained patent. Following a period of 12-hour observation and monitoring for respiratory depression, he was discharged once fully alert.

acute_toxicity_from_benzodiazepines_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic nitrazepam toxicity in the elderly
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent falls and confusion
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with mild cognitive impairment was admitted following three falls in 48 hours. Review revealed a recent dose increase of nitrazepam for insomnia, leading to drug accumulation and significant daytime sedation. Symptoms resolved within 72 hours of discontinuing the medication and providing gentle rehydration.

acute_toxicity_from_benzodiazepines_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe mixed benzodiazepine and ethanol toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Comatose state and respiratory insufficiency
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with a history of alcohol dependence was found unresponsive with empty blister packs of temazepam. On arrival, GCS was 4, oxygen saturations were 84% on room air, and arterial blood gas showed respiratory acidosis. He required emergent intubation and ICU admission for mechanical ventilation; he was successfully extubated on day 3.

acute_toxicity_from_benzodiazepines_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic lorazepam toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Dysarthria and impaired coordination
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male, prescribed lorazepam 2mg TDS for anxiety, took an additional 20mg during a panic attack. He presented with significant dysarthria and a broad-based gait but maintained a GCS of 14. He was monitored in the Medical Assessment Unit for 24 hours until symptoms improved, followed by a psychiatric review.

acute_toxicity_from_benzodiazepines_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Flumazenil-induced seizure in chronic BZD user
  presenting_complaint: Generalized tonic-clonic seizure following reversal agent
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old chronic diazepam user presented with acute toxicity; flumazenil was inadvertently administered by a junior doctor to reverse sedation. This precipitated a prolonged generalized tonic-clonic seizure due to acute withdrawal of GABAergic tone. The seizure was managed with levetiracetam, and the patient required ICU stabilization.

acute_toxicity_from_benzodiazepines_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Benzodiazepine toxicity mimicking acute stroke
  presenting_complaint: Left-sided weakness and slurred speech
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female presented as a "stroke call" with focal neurological signs and obtundation. Brain CT was unremarkable, but a subsequent toxicology screen was positive for high levels of midazolam, which she had mistakenly double-dosed. Her focal deficits resolved completely as the drug was metabolised, confirming toxicity-induced pseudostroke.

acute_toxicity_from_benzodiazepines_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute oxazepam toxicity secondary to renal impairment
  presenting_complaint: Progressive lethargy and poor oral intake
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with Stage 4 CKD developed progressive somnolence over one week while taking prescribed oxazepam. Investigations showed an acute-on-chronic kidney injury (Cr 450) leading to reduced clearance of benzodiazepine metabolites. He required temporary haemodialysis and cessation of the sedative to restore baseline mental status.

acute_toxicity_from_benzodiazepines_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe "Street Valium" (Etizolam) toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Deep coma and pinpoint pupils
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male was found unresponsive in a community setting after consuming "blue valium" (illicit etizolam). He presented with a GCS of 3 and severe respiratory depression, initially failing to respond to naloxone. Toxicology later confirmed high-concentration etizolam; he required a 48-hour sedative infusion in ICU to manage subsequent agitation during the "washout" phase.

acute_toxicity_from_benzodiazepines_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Clonazepam toxicity complicated by aspiration pneumonia
  presenting_complaint: Fever, cough, and reduced consciousness
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female ingested 40mg of clonazepam and was found 12 hours later by family. She had a GCS of 7 and signs of right-sided consolidation on chest X-ray, consistent with aspiration. She was treated with intravenous co-amoxiclav and supportive ventilation, remaining in hospital for 10 days.

acute_toxicity_from_benzodiazepines_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Paradoxical reaction to midazolam
  presenting_complaint: Severe agitation and tachycardia
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old female underwent dental sedation with oral midazolam but became violently agitated and combative rather than sedated. Her heart rate rose to 160 bpm, and she required physical restraint to prevent self-harm. The reaction was managed with a small dose of promethazine and a quiet environment until the midazolam effect subsided.

acute_toxicity_from_benzodiazepines_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-procedural midazolam overdose
  presenting_complaint: Apnoea following gastroscopy
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male received 5mg of midazolam for an endoscopic procedure but developed sudden apnoea in the recovery room. Bag-valve-mask ventilation was initiated immediately, and a single dose of 200mcg flumazenil was administered with good effect. He was monitored for 4 hours for resedation before being safely discharged.

acute_toxicity_from_benzodiazepines_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Mixed diazepam and amitriptyline toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Hypotension and widened QRS complex on ECG
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old female presented with a mixed overdose of diazepam and amitriptyline. While the diazepam caused deep sedation, the amitriptyline induced cardiac toxicity with a QRS duration of 140ms and hypotension. She was treated with sodium bicarbonate for the TCA effects and supportive care for the benzodiazepine-induced coma.

acute_toxicity_from_benzodiazepines_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild chlordiazepoxide toxicity during alcohol detox
  presenting_complaint: Excessive drowsiness and unsteady gait
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male undergoing community alcohol detoxification was prescribed a Librium (chlordiazepoxide) taper. He took his doses too close together, resulting in significant over-sedation and a fall. The GP reduced the taper schedule, and the patient's symptoms resolved without requiring hospital admission.

acute_toxicity_from_benzodiazepines_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic midazolam toxicity in palliative care
  presenting_complaint: Myoclonus and paradoxical terminal restlessness
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with end-stage lung cancer on a midazolam syringe driver developed worsening agitation and myoclonic jerks. Clinical review suggested metabolite accumulation (midazolam-1-glucuronide) due to declining hepatic function. The infusion was switched to levomepromazine, which resulted in improved symptom control and settled the agitation.

acute_toxicity_from_benzodiazepines_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute diazepam toxicity in a "body stuffer"
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly declining GCS following police pursuit
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male swallowed approximately 50 tablets of diazepam to avoid detection during a police search. Within 30 minutes, his GCS dropped from 15 to 6. He underwent emergency gastric lavage in A&E followed by activated charcoal administration and was monitored in a high-dependency unit for 24 hours.

acute_toxicity_from_benzodiazepines_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute lorazepam toxicity in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Reduced fetal movements and maternal sedation
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old pregnant female (34 weeks gestation) presented after ingesting 15mg of lorazepam. Obstetric review showed a "sleepy" fetal heart rate trace with reduced variability on CTG. Maternal supportive care led to full recovery, and fetal monitoring normalised as the drug was cleared; no emergency delivery was required.

acute_toxicity_from_benzodiazepines_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory phenazepam toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Prolonged coma (5 days)
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male ingested an unknown quantity of phenazepam, a long-acting benzodiazepine. He remained in a deep coma (GCS 5) for over 100 hours despite no co-ingestants. He required prolonged intubation and nasogastric feeding in the ICU until the drug eventually cleared and he regained consciousness without focal deficit.

acute_toxicity_from_benzodiazepines_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Synergistic alprazolam and methadone toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Severe hypoxia and pinpoint pupils
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female on a methadone programme presented with a respiratory rate of 6 and saturations of 78%. She had co-ingested 10mg of alprazolam. She required multiple naloxone boluses and a naloxone infusion, but remained heavily sedated for 24 hours due to the long-acting nature of the benzodiazepine component.

acute_toxicity_from_benzodiazepines_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Diazepam toxicity in decompensated cirrhosis
  presenting_complaint: Worsening hepatic encephalopathy
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male with known alcoholic cirrhosis was given diazepam for agitation. Due to severely impaired hepatic metabolism, he developed profound, prolonged sedation and hypercapnia. The clinical picture was initially confused with worsening encephalopathy, but a positive BZD screen and slow recovery after stopping the drug confirmed iatrogenic toxicity.
