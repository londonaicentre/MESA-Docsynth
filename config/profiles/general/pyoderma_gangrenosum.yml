pyoderma_gangrenosum_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Classic Ulcerative Pyoderma Gangrenosum
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly enlarging, exquisitely painful leg ulcer with purple edges.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with known ulcerative colitis presented with a 2cm pustule on his left pretibial area following minor trauma. Over 7 days, it evolved into a 10cm ulcer with undermined violaceous borders and a necrotic base. Skin biopsy confirmed a dense neutrophilic infiltrate, and he was started on high-dose oral prednisolone (60mg), resulting in rapid stabilisation and eventual healing over three months.

pyoderma_gangrenosum_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-surgical Pyoderma Gangrenosum (Pathergy)
  presenting_complaint: Severe wound breakdown and ulceration following a bilateral mastectomy.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female underwent surgery for breast cancer; ten days post-operatively, her surgical incisions developed progressive ulceration despite multiple courses of antibiotics. Initially suspected as necrotising fasciitis, the lack of response to surgical debridement and worsening of the lesions suggested pathergy. A diagnosis of PG was made, and she responded significantly to systemic ciclosporin and intravenous methylprednisolone.

pyoderma_gangrenosum_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Bullous Pyoderma Gangrenosum
  presenting_complaint: Painful blisters and erosions on the dorsal hands and forearms.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with underlying myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) developed acute, superficial blue-grey bullae that rapidly eroded. Clinical examination and histology were consistent with the bullous variant of PG, often associated with haematological malignancy. Treatment focused on managing the MDS alongside systemic corticosteroids, though the skin lesions showed a waxing and waning course.

pyoderma_gangrenosum_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Vegetative (Granulomatous) Pyoderma Gangrenosum
  presenting_complaint: Chronic, non-painful superficial ulcerated plaque on the trunk.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old retired farmer presented with a six-month history of a slow-growing, verrucous plaque on his abdomen. Unlike classic PG, the lesion was not painful and lacked the characteristic violaceous border. Histopathology revealed a superficial granulomatous process, and the lesion was successfully treated with topical tacrolimus and potent corticosteroids without the need for systemic immunosuppression.

pyoderma_gangrenosum_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Peristomal Pyoderma Gangrenosum
  presenting_complaint: Extremely painful ulceration surrounding an ileostomy site.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female with Crohn’s disease and a permanent ileostomy reported difficulty maintaining a stoma seal due to surrounding ulceration. Clinical review identified multiple small, painful ulcers with undermined edges at the stoma-skin interface. Management involved stoma care optimisation, intralesional steroid injections, and an increase in her maintenance dose of adalimumab, leading to complete resolution.

pyoderma_gangrenosum_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Pustular Pyoderma Gangrenosum
  presenting_complaint: Multiple small, painful pustules on the shins during an IBD flare.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old female student with active ulcerative colitis developed numerous discrete pustules on both legs. Unlike bacterial folliculitis, these lesions were sterile on culture and were intensely painful. The pustules persisted until her bowel inflammation was controlled with intensified anti-TNF therapy, confirming a diagnosis of pustular PG.

pyoderma_gangrenosum_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Pyoderma Gangrenosum
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent, non-healing ulcers on the lower limbs despite standard therapy.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male with rheumatoid arthritis had a three-year history of bilateral leg ulcers. He failed to respond to prednisolone, ciclosporin, and mycophenolate mofetil. Eventually, the introduction of ustekinumab (anti-IL12/23) led to significant epithelialisation of the chronic ulcers, highlighting the challenge of treatment-resistant cases.

pyoderma_gangrenosum_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Pyoderma Gangrenosum
  presenting_complaint: Large, painful ulcer on the thigh of an 8-year-old girl.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old girl with no prior medical history presented with a rapidly progressing ulcer on her right thigh following a fall. Extensive workup for infection and vasculitis was negative. She was diagnosed with idiopathic paediatric PG and responded well to a tapering course of prednisolone, though she required long-term monitoring for potential underlying systemic disease.

pyoderma_gangrenosum_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Pyoderma Gangrenosum associated with PAPA Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent sterile joint swelling and severe acne-like skin ulceration.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male presented with a history of recurrent sterile pyogenic arthritis since childhood. He developed multiple deep, necrotic skin ulcers on his legs and back. Genetic testing confirmed a mutation in the PSTPIP1 gene, diagnosing PAPA (Pyogenic Arthritis, Pyoderma gangrenosum, and Acne) syndrome, and his PG was managed with the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra.

pyoderma_gangrenosum_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Extracutaneous Pyoderma Gangrenosum (Pulmonary)
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath, cough, and painful skin ulcers.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with classic leg PG developed sterile pulmonary nodules and pleural effusions. Lung biopsy showed a neutrophilic infiltrate similar to the skin lesions, with no evidence of infection or malignancy. Both the skin and pulmonary manifestations responded concurrently to high-dose systemic corticosteroids, representing a rare extracutaneous involvement of PG.

pyoderma_gangrenosum_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-Chronic Pyoderma Gangrenosum
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening and intense pain in a long-standing leg ulcer.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female had a stable, small PG ulcer for two years. Following a mechanical fall and local trauma, the ulcer expanded by 5cm in 48 hours with severe liquefactive necrosis. She was admitted for pain management with IV opiates and started on IV methylprednisolone pulses to arrest the acute inflammatory phase.

pyoderma_gangrenosum_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Pyoderma Gangrenosum mimicking Venous Ulceration
  presenting_complaint: Chronic leg ulcer initially treated as a venous ulcer for 12 months.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old woman with varicose veins was treated in the community with compression bandaging for a medial malleolus ulcer. The ulcer failed to heal and became increasingly painful with a violaceous rim. Review by a dermatologist and a punch biopsy led to a diagnosis of PG, and she improved rapidly once compression was stopped and topical clobetasol propionate was initiated.

pyoderma_gangrenosum_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Facial Pyoderma Gangrenosum
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly progressing painful ulcer on the cheek and jawline.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male presented with what was initially thought to be severe odontogenic infection or carbuncle. The lesion failed to respond to broad-spectrum antibiotics and rapidly enlarged to involve the earlobe. Biopsy and negative cultures led to a diagnosis of facial PG, which carried a high risk of cosmetic disfigurement, necessitating aggressive treatment with infliximab.

pyoderma_gangrenosum_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Pyoderma Gangrenosum with Monoclonal Gammopathy
  presenting_complaint: Multiple scattered ulcers on the trunk and limbs.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female was referred for multiple painful ulcers. Protein electrophoresis revealed an IgA monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The PG was found to be a paraneoplastic manifestation of her plasma cell dyscrasia, and the ulcers required combined therapy with dapsone and steroids for control.

pyoderma_gangrenosum_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Malignant Pyoderma Gangrenosum (Superficial Ulcerative)
  presenting_complaint: Aggressive ulceration of the head and neck.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male presented with "malignant" PG, an older term for a superficial but highly destructive variant affecting the upper body. The ulcers showed minimal undermined borders but significant horizontal spread. Despite the name, no malignancy was found, and the patient achieved remission after a six-month course of oral ciclosporin.

pyoderma_gangrenosum_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Drug-Induced Pyoderma Gangrenosum
  presenting_complaint: New onset of painful skin ulcers shortly after starting Sunitinib.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old patient with renal cell carcinoma developed classic PG-like ulcers on the shins three weeks after commencing the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Sunitinib. The lesions resolved upon withdrawal of the drug and a short course of topical steroids. Re-challenge with a different TKI did not cause recurrence, suggesting a drug-specific reaction.

pyoderma_gangrenosum_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Pyoderma Gangrenosum with Secondary Infection
  presenting_complaint: Foul-smelling, purulent ulcer with systemic fever and rigors.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with established PG presented with acute clinical deterioration. Swabs grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa and MRSA, complicating the underlying neutrophilic dermatosis. He required admission for IV antibiotics to treat the secondary cellulitis before his immunosuppressive regimen for PG could be safely escalated.

pyoderma_gangrenosum_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Genital Pyoderma Gangrenosum
  presenting_complaint: Exquisitely painful ulceration of the vulva.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female was referred from a GUM clinic after failing treatment for suspected herpes simplex and syphilis. Examination showed a deep, sharply demarcated ulcer on the labia majora. Biopsy confirmed PG, and she was started on oral prednisolone, which led to a dramatic reduction in pain within 48 hours.

pyoderma_gangrenosum_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Pyoderma Gangrenosum with Pathergy from Debridement
  presenting_complaint: Massive expansion of a wound following surgical cleaning.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male with a small, undiagnosed leg ulcer underwent surgical debridement in the emergency department for "infected tissue." Within 24 hours, the wound size tripled, and the patient developed systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The diagnosis was corrected to PG, and the use of "split-thickness skin grafting" was only successful later under heavy cover of ciclosporin.

pyoderma_gangrenosum_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Pyoderma Gangrenosum in Pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Painful leg ulcer developing in the third trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old pregnant female developed a classic PG ulcer on her left calf. Management was complicated by the need to avoid certain medications; she was successfully treated with topical steroids and a low-dose oral prednisolone regimen, with no adverse effects on the foetus, and the ulcer healed completely postpartum.
