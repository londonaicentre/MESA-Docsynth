  primary_diagnosis: Acute Silicosis
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly worsening shortness of breath and weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male kitchen fitter specializing in engineered stone (quartz) presented with subacute respiratory failure. HRCT revealed a "crazy paving" pattern and ground-glass opacities, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) confirmed alveolar proteinosis-like material. Despite aggressive corticosteroid treatment, his condition deteriorated, necessitating referral for urgent lung transplantation assessment.

  presenting_complaint: Right-sided pleuritic chest pain and dullness to percussion.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male retired carpenter presented with a large unilateral pleural effusion and 10kg weight loss. Pleural fluid cytology was inconclusive, but a thoracoscopic pleural biopsy confirmed epithelioid mesothelioma. He underwent palliative chemotherapy (pemetrexed and cisplatin) and an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) was inserted for symptom control.

  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic; incidental finding on pre-operative chest X-ray.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male ex-coal miner underwent a routine CXR prior to elective hip surgery, which revealed multiple 2-5mm nodules in the upper zones. PFTs were within normal limits for his age, and no significant emphysema was noted. He was reassured that no active treatment was required but was advised regarding eligibility for Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit.

  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of fever, chills, and dyspnoea 6 hours after work.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old farm labourer presented to A&E with acute flu-like symptoms after handling mouldy hay. CXR showed diffuse micronodular opacities, and BAL showed a marked lymphocytosis (60%). He responded rapidly to oral prednisolone and was advised to use high-efficiency respiratory protective equipment (RPE) and improve barn ventilation.

  presenting_complaint: Dry cough, fatigue, and exertional breathlessness.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female electronics technician presented with symptoms mimicking sarcoidosis, including hilar lymphadenopathy on CXR. A positive Beryllium Lymphocyte Proliferation Test (BeLPT) confirmed the diagnosis of berylliosis related to her work with alloy components. She was commenced on long-term immunosuppression with methotrexate to manage progressive granulomatous lung disease.

occupational_lung_disease_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Isocyanate-induced Occupational Asthma
  presenting_complaint: Severe acute bronchospasm and cough.
  summary_of_course: A 41-year-old car sprayer presented with acute-on-chronic wheezing following a spill of polyurethane paint. Despite using a mask, he developed significant airway hyper-responsiveness, confirmed by a positive methacholine challenge test. He required a career change as even minute exposures triggered life-threatening asthma attacks.

occupational_lung_disease_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Hard Metal Lung Disease
  presenting_complaint: Subacute cough and bibasal crackles.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male diamond polisher using cobalt-tungsten carbide tools presented with interstitial lung disease symptoms. Lung biopsy revealed Giant Cell Interstitial Pneumonia (GIP), the pathognomonic feature of hard metal lung disease. His symptoms stabilized following complete cessation of exposure and a course of oral corticosteroids.

occupational_lung_disease_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Byssinosis
  presenting_complaint: Chest tightness specifically on the first day of the work week.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old female textile worker in a cotton mill reported "Monday morning fever" and chest tightness that resolved by Wednesday. Spirometry demonstrated a significant decline in FEV1 over the course of a Monday shift. She was diagnosed with Grade 2 byssinosis and managed with bronchodilators and workplace dust suppression measures.

occupational_lung_disease_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Siderosis (Welder's Lung)
  presenting_complaint: Abnormal chest X-ray during routine occupational screening.
  summary_of_course: A 47-year-old arc welder of 20 years was found to have widespread fine stippled opacities on CXR. He was entirely asymptomatic with normal PFTs and no evidence of fibrosis on HRCT. He was diagnosed with siderosis, a benign pneumoconiosis caused by iron oxide inhalation, requiring only periodic monitoring and improved fume extraction.

occupational_lung_disease_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Bronchiolitis Obliterans (Popcorn Lung)
  presenting_complaint: Severe, fixed breathlessness and dry cough.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old male worker at a flavouring manufacturing plant presented with rapidly progressive airway obstruction. FEV1 was 40% predicted with no reversibility, and HRCT showed mosaic attenuation and air trapping on expiration. The diagnosis was linked to diacetyl exposure; he was treated with inhaled triple therapy but remained significantly disabled.

  primary_diagnosis: Silico-tuberculosis
  presenting_complaint: Fever, night sweats, and worsening cough in a patient with known silicosis.
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old male tunnel driller with pre-existing chronic silicosis presented with constitutional symptoms and a new cavitary lesion on CXR. Sputum smear was positive for Acid-Fast Bacilli (AFB), confirming Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. He required an extended 9-month course of anti-tuberculous therapy due to the impaired macrophage function associated with silica-laden lungs.

  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding on CT scan for suspected pulmonary embolism.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male plumber was found to have well-circumscribed, calcified pleural plaques along the posterolateral chest wall and diaphragm. He was asymptomatic with normal lung function. He was counselled that plaques are a marker of asbestos exposure but do not cause functional impairment or progress to malignancy, though they indicate an increased lifetime risk of other asbestos-related diseases.

  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Silicosis with Comorbid COPD
  presenting_complaint: Chronic productive cough and exertional dyspnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 71-year-old male retired foundry worker and heavy smoker presented with mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease.

  primary_diagnosis: Bird Fancier's Lung (Occupational)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic dry cough and gradual decline in exercise tolerance.
  summary_of_course: A 26-year-old female pet shop assistant presented with a 6-month history of breathlessness. HRCT showed diffuse centrilobular ground-glass nodules and "three-density" sign. Serum precipitating antibodies to avian antigens were strongly positive, confirming occupational hypersensitivity pneumonitis from cleaning bird cages.

  primary_diagnosis: Indium Lung
  presenting_complaint: Dyspnoea and finger clubbing.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old male technician in an LCD screen manufacturing facility presented with interstitial opacities. Serum indium levels were significantly elevated (50 ng/mL), and histology showed cholesterol granulomas and alveolar proteinosis. Despite cessation of exposure, his interstitial fibrosis progressed, requiring long-term steroid therapy.

  presenting_complaint: Multiple lung nodules and painful, swollen finger joints.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male ex-coal miner with a history of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) presented with multiple large (1-3cm) peripheral lung nodules on CXR. Biopsy showed necrobiotic nodules with a peripheral zone of inflammation and coal dust. He was diagnosed with Caplan's syndrome and managed with DMARDs for his RA, alongside monitoring of his pulmonary nodules.

  primary_diagnosis: Acute Chlorine Gas Inhalation
  presenting_complaint: Severe stridor, wheeze, and respiratory distress.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male industrial cleaner was accidentally exposed to high concentrations of chlorine gas following a chemical mixing error.
