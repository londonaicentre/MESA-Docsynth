  presenting_complaint: Persistent toe-walking and frequent falls.
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old boy born at 30 weeks gestation presented to the paediatric clinic with gait abnormalities and lower limb stiffness. Physical examination revealed increased tone in bilateral gastrocnemii and brisk knee reflexes, confirmed as spastic diplegia via MRI showing periventricular leukomalacia. He was commenced on a programme of intensive physiotherapy and bilateral ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) with significant improvement in mobility.

cerebral_palsy_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Dyskinetic cerebral palsy with status dystonicus
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of severe, painful involuntary muscle contractions and pyrexia.
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old male with known severe dyskinetic CP was admitted to the PICU in status dystonicus following a chest infection. He exhibited metabolic derangement with elevated creatine kinase levels (15,000 U/L) indicating rhabdomyolysis. Treatment involved aggressive sedation with midazolam and clonidine infusions, alongside cooling measures and hydration, leading to gradual stabilisation over ten days.

cerebral_palsy_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy
  presenting_complaint: Reduced spontaneous movement of the left arm and leg.
  summary_of_course: An 18-month-old female was referred by her health visitor due to a strong right-hand preference and dragging of the left foot. Cranial imaging identified a right-sided middle cerebral artery territory infarct, likely neonatal. She was diagnosed with hemiplegic CP and started on constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) to improve functional use of the upper limb.

cerebral_palsy_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy with aspiration pneumonia
  presenting_complaint: Acute shortness of breath, coughing during feeds, and oxygen desaturation.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old girl with GMFCS level V spastic quadriplegia was admitted via A&E with acute respiratory distress. Chest X-ray confirmed right lower lobe consolidation consistent with aspiration pneumonia secondary to oropharyngeal dysphagia. She was treated with intravenous antibiotics and referred for a formal videofluoroscopy swallow study, which necessitated the transition from oral to gastrostomy (PEG) feeding.

cerebral_palsy_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Ataxic cerebral palsy
  presenting_complaint: Generalised instability, intention tremor, and delayed walking.
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old boy presented with a history of late motor milestones and persistent truncal ataxia. Investigations, including genetic screening for hereditary ataxias, were negative, but MRI showed cerebellar hypoplasia. He was diagnosed with ataxic CP and currently receives occupational therapy to assist with fine motor tasks and school-based support for dyspraxia.

cerebral_palsy_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy with painful hip subluxation
  presenting_complaint: Severe pain during nappy changes and refusal to sit in a wheelchair.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old non-ambulant male presented with acute-on-chronic hip pain and increased scissoring of the lower limbs. Pelvic X-rays revealed 70% displacement of the left femoral head (subluxation) due to chronic spasticity of the adductor muscles. He underwent bilateral adductor tenotomies and a Varus Derotation Osteotomy (VDRO) to stabilise the joint and alleviate pain.

cerebral_palsy_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Mixed cerebral palsy (spastic-dyskinetic)
  presenting_complaint: Fluctuating muscle tone and difficulty with speech.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old woman with a history of birth asphyxia exhibits both spasticity in the lower limbs and choreoathetoid movements in the upper limbs. She uses a powered wheelchair and an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) device for severe dysarthria. Her management focuses on oral baclofen for spasticity and trihexyphenidyl for dystonia, with regular multidisciplinary review in a specialist adult transition clinic.

cerebral_palsy_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Spastic diplegic cerebral palsy with neuromuscular scoliosis
  presenting_complaint: Progressive spinal curvature and difficulty maintaining a seated position.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old girl with moderate spastic diplegia showed a rapidly progressing thoracolumbar curve on routine screening, measuring 55 degrees Cobb angle. The scoliosis was impacting her respiratory function and seating balance. She was scheduled for posterior spinal fusion surgery to prevent further deformity and maintain her ability to use a manual wheelchair.

cerebral_palsy_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy with refractory epilepsy
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic seizures.
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old boy with right-sided hemiplegia developed drug-resistant epilepsy at age 5. Despite trials of three different anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), he continued to experience weekly seizures impacting his cognitive development. Following a multidisciplinary pre-surgical evaluation, he was considered for a Vagus Nerve Stimulator (VNS) insertion to reduce seizure frequency and severity.

cerebral_palsy_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy with chronic constipation
  presenting_complaint: Abdominal distension, vomiting, and overflow diarrhoea.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with severe CP and limited mobility presented with acute abdominal pain; an abdominal X-ray showed significant faecal loading. This was attributed to a combination of low fibre intake, inadequate hydration, and reduced colonic motility associated with his primary diagnosis. He required a manual evacuation under sedation followed by a long-term maintenance regimen of macrogol laxatives and stimulant aperients.

cerebral_palsy_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild spastic diplegic cerebral palsy
  presenting_complaint: Muscle cramps and fatigue after walking short distances.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old man was diagnosed with mild CP in childhood but had been lost to follow-up for twenty years. He presented with worsening musculoskeletal pain and "early ageing" symptoms, common in adults with CP. He was referred to a specialist adult CP service for gait analysis and was prescribed botulinum toxin injections to the calf muscles to reduce spasticity-related pain.

cerebral_palsy_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Dyskinetic cerebral palsy with severe GORD
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent haematemesis and irritability during feeds.
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old girl with athetoid movements and poor head control was diagnosed with severe gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). Endoscopy revealed Grade C oesophagitis, likely exacerbated by the high intra-abdominal pressure from dystonic posturing. She was managed with high-dose proton pump inhibitors and eventually required a Nissen fundoplication to prevent further oesophageal damage and chronic micro-aspiration.

cerebral_palsy_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy with baclofen pump failure
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of severe muscle rigidity, tachycardia, and hallucinations.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old woman with an intrathecal baclofen pump presented to A&E with symptoms of acute baclofen withdrawal. Investigation revealed a catheter disconnection, leading to a life-threatening increase in spasticity and autonomic instability. She was treated with high-dose oral baclofen and benzodiazepines as a bridge until the pump system could be surgically repaired.

cerebral_palsy_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Monoplegic cerebral palsy
  presenting_complaint: Isolated weakness and poor coordination of the right hand.
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old girl presented with difficulty with handwriting and fine motor tasks. While originally thought to have a peripheral nerve injury, MRI of the brain revealed a small focal cortical dysplasia in the left motor cortex. She was diagnosed with monoplegic CP, a rare presentation, and her management plan focuses on occupational therapy and school-based adaptations.

cerebral_palsy_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy with osteopenia
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of thigh pain and swelling after a minor fall.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old non-ambulant woman with severe CP was brought to the hospital after a low-energy transfer resulted in a femoral shaft fracture. DEXA scanning confirmed significant osteoporosis, common in non-weight-bearing patients with CP. The fracture was managed with intramedullary nailing, and she was started on bisphosphonate therapy and vitamin D supplementation.

cerebral_palsy_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Spastic diplegic cerebral palsy with neurogenic bladder
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent urinary tract infections and worsening urinary incontinence.
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old male with spastic diplegia reported increasing difficulty with bladder control. Urodynamic studies showed detrusor overactivity and sphincter dyssynergia, consistent with a neurogenic bladder secondary to his upper motor neurone lesion. He was started on oxybutynin and a clean intermittent catheterisation (CIC) programme to protect his renal function and improve social continence.

cerebral_palsy_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy with chronic respiratory failure
  presenting_complaint: Morning headaches, daytime somnolence, and recurrent chest infections.
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old male with GMFCS level V CP and severe kyphoscoliosis was found to have nocturnal hypoventilation on sleep studies. His capillary blood gas showed compensated respiratory acidosis with an elevated pCO2. He was successfully commenced on nocturnal non-invasive ventilation (NIV), which improved his daytime alertness and reduced the frequency of hospital admissions for respiratory exacerbations.

cerebral_palsy_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Athetoid cerebral palsy with cervical myelopathy
  presenting_complaint: New onset of weakness in the hands and "electric shock" sensations down the spine.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old man with known athetoid CP presented with worsening upper limb function. MRI of the cervical spine revealed severe degenerative changes and cord compression (myelopathy) caused by decades of involuntary neck movements. He underwent urgent cervical decompression and fusion to prevent further neurological deterioration, though his post-operative recovery was complicated by persistent dystonia.

cerebral_palsy_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Spastic diplegic cerebral palsy with visual impairment
  presenting_complaint: Difficulty navigating school environment and bumping into objects.
  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old boy with spastic diplegia was referred to ophthalmology for a formal assessment. He was diagnosed with Cerebral Visual Impairment (CVI), a common comorbidity in CP where the brain cannot process visual information correctly despite healthy eyes. His school plan was updated to include high-contrast materials and reduced visual clutter to support his learning and mobility.

cerebral_palsy_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy with multi-organ dysfunction
  presenting_complaint: Hypotension, oliguria, and altered consciousness.
  summary_of_course: A 13-year-old girl with severe CP was admitted to the ICU with septic shock secondary to an infected pressure ulcer on her sacrum. She developed acute kidney injury and required vasopressor support and continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVH). Following a prolonged stay, she was stabilised but required an intensive multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme to return to her baseline level of function.
