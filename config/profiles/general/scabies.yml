scabies_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Classic scabies
  presenting_complaint: Intense generalised pruritus, worse at night, and a rash between the fingers.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old male presented with a 3-week history of nocturnal itching and erythematous papules in the finger webs and wrists. Clinical examination identified visible burrows, and a diagnosis of classic scabies was made. He was treated with two applications of permethrin 5% cream one week apart, alongside all household contacts, resulting in full resolution.

scabies_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Scabies with secondary impetiginisation
  presenting_complaint: Itchy rash with yellow crusting and sores on the limbs.
  summary_of_course: A 6-year-old girl presented with a subacute pruritic eruption complicated by honey-coloured crusting on her legs. Swabs confirmed Staphylococcus aureus infection secondary to scratching scabietic lesions. She required a course of oral flucloxacillin followed by standard permethrin treatment for the underlying infestation, with good clinical recovery.

scabies_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Crusted (Norwegian) scabies
  presenting_complaint: Thick, scaly plaques on the hands and feet with minimal itching.
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old female resident of a nursing home presented with hyperkeratotic, greyish crusts on her palms and soles. Initially misdiagnosed as psoriasis, skin scrapings revealed a massive mite burden confirming crusted scabies. She was managed with a combination of oral ivermectin and topical malathion in an isolation room, and the facility initiated an outbreak protocol.

scabies_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Scabies in an immunocompromised host
  presenting_complaint: Widespread itchy papular rash and weight loss.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male with poorly controlled HIV presented with a severe, generalised papular eruption. Due to his compromised immune status, the infestation was extensive but lacked the typical crusted appearance. He was treated with a multi-dose regimen of oral ivermectin (days 1, 2, 8, 9, and 15) and topical permethrin, leading to eventual clearance.

scabies_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Recurrent scabies due to treatment failure
  presenting_complaint: Persistent itching despite two courses of topical treatment.
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old female reported ongoing nocturnal pruritus after completing two rounds of permethrin. Investigation revealed that her partner had not been treated and her bedding was not washed at 60 degrees Celsius, leading to re-infestation. After educating the patient on environmental decontamination and treating all contacts simultaneously with malathion, the symptoms subsided.

scabies_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Nodular scabies
  presenting_complaint: Persistent, highly itchy red-brown lumps on the genitals.
  summary_of_course: An 11-year-old boy presented with firm, 5mm pruritic nodules on the scrotum and penis following a treated scabies infestation. Despite the absence of new burrows, the nodules remained intensely itchy for weeks. He was diagnosed with nodular scabies, a hypersensitivity reaction, and successfully treated with topical moderate-potency corticosteroids.

scabies_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Scabies incognito
  presenting_complaint: Widespread, poorly defined rash that worsened after using steroid cream.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male was initially treated for presumed eczema with topical betamethasone for six weeks. The rash became widespread and atypical, losing the classic burrow distribution, but dermoscopy eventually revealed Sarcoptes scabiei mites. The steroids were ceased, and he was successfully treated with permethrin, though the inflammatory response was prolonged.

scabies_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Infantile scabies
  presenting_complaint: Irritability, poor feeding, and blisters on the soles of the feet.
  summary_of_course: An 8-month-old infant presented with a vesicular and pustular eruption involving the palms, soles, and face, which is unusual for adults. The mother also reported nocturnal itching. The infant was treated with permethrin 5% cream (applied to the whole body including the scalp) and showed significant improvement within 10 days.

scabies_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Scabies-associated cellulitis and sepsis
  presenting_complaint: Severe leg pain, swelling, fever, and a long-standing itchy rash.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old diabetic male presented to A&E with systemic inflammatory response syndrome and right lower limb cellulitis. History revealed a chronic, untreated scabies infestation that served as the portal of entry for Group A Streptococcus. He was stabilised with intravenous antibiotics and subsequently treated for scabies with oral ivermectin.

scabies_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Institutional scabies outbreak
  presenting_complaint: Multiple inmates with itchy rashes and excoriations.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old male in a correctional facility presented with classic scabietic burrows on his wrists. Public health authorities identified 15 other symptomatic individuals within the same wing. A mass treatment programme using oral ivermectin was implemented for all inmates and staff to break the cycle of transmission.

scabies_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Scabies in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Intense itching on the abdomen and breasts during the third trimester.
  summary_of_course: A 33-year-old pregnant female presented with a pruritic eruption focused on the periumbilical area and nipples. Clinical burrows confirmed scabies. Permethrin 5% cream was prescribed as the first-line treatment due to its safety profile in pregnancy, and the patient reported complete resolution after two applications.

scabies_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-scabietic pruritus
  presenting_complaint: Continued itching four weeks after completing scabies treatment.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male returned to his GP complaining of persistent itch despite no new lesions. Dermoscopic examination was negative for live mites or new burrows, confirming post-scabietic pruritus (an immunological reaction). He was managed with emollients and oral antihistamines, and the itch gradually resolved over the following month.

scabies_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic neglected scabies
  presenting_complaint: Widespread excoriations, lichenification, and secondary infection.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old homeless male presented with a six-month history of "itchy skin." Examination showed extensive lichenification from chronic scratching and multiple areas of secondary bacterial infection. He was admitted for skin debridement, topical antibiotics, and supervised scabies treatment with ivermectin, resulting in significant dermatological improvement.

scabies_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Bullous scabies
  presenting_complaint: Tense blisters and itching on the limbs of an elderly patient.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male presented with a blistering eruption mimicking bullous pemphigoid. However, the presence of burrows and a positive skin scraping for mites led to a diagnosis of bullous scabies. He responded well to anti-scabietic treatment combined with a short course of oral prednisolone to manage the bullous reaction.

scabies_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Scabies in a bedbound patient
  presenting_complaint: Rash localized to the back, buttocks, and pressure areas.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old female, bedbound following a stroke, developed a pruritic rash concentrated on her back and posterior thighs. In immobile patients, the distribution can be atypical, focusing on areas of skin-to-bed contact. Diagnosis was confirmed via microscopy, and she was treated with malathion liquid, requiring assistance from nursing staff for application.

scabies_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Scabies with iron-deficiency anaemia
  presenting_complaint: Severe itch, pallor, and lethargy in a paediatric refugee.
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old girl recently arrived from a refugee camp presented with a heavy scabies burden and secondary impetigo. Blood tests revealed iron-deficiency anaemia, likely exacerbated by chronic hookworm infection and the nutritional stress of chronic skin inflammation. She was treated with ivermectin, oral iron supplements, and antibiotics, leading to a recovery of both skin and systemic health.

scabies_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Occupational scabies
  presenting_complaint: Mildly itchy papules on the hands of a healthcare worker.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old nurse developed symptoms two weeks after caring for a patient with undiagnosed crusted scabies. Due to early recognition, the infestation was mild with only two visible burrows. She was treated promptly with permethrin and took leave from work until the first treatment was completed to prevent further hospital transmission.

scabies_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Genital scabies
  presenting_complaint: Itchy sores on the penis, suspected to be a sexually transmitted infection.
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old male attended a GUM clinic concerned about syphilis or herpes. Examination showed characteristic scabietic papules on the glans penis and burrows on the wrists, with no evidence of treponemal infection on serology. He was treated with permethrin and advised on contact tracing for recent sexual partners.

scabies_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Scalp involvement in elderly scabies
  presenting_complaint: Itching and scaling of the scalp and neck in a patient with dementia.
  summary_of_course: A 91-year-old male with advanced dementia presented with an itchy, scaly scalp, which is an atypical site for adult scabies but common in the very elderly. Skin scrapings from the neck confirmed the presence of mites. Treatment required application of scabicides from the top of the head to the soles of the feet, including the scalp and ears.

scabies_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory crusted scabies
  presenting_complaint: Failure of multiple treatments for a severe, scaly skin condition.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) developed crusted scabies that failed to respond to two doses of ivermectin. She required an intensified regimen of seven doses of oral ivermectin over 28 days combined with twice-weekly topical permethrin and keratolytics. This aggressive approach finally achieved mycological clearance.
