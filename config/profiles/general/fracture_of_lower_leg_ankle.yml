  primary_diagnosis: Fragility fracture of the distal fibula
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset of ankle pain while walking.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with known osteoporosis and dementia sustained a minimally displaced Weber B fracture. Due to her high frailty and comorbidities, she was managed in a total contact cast rather than undergoing surgery. Her recovery was complicated by a pressure sore under the cast.

  presenting_complaint: Persistent pain and "clicking" sensation at the fracture site six months post-injury.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old heavy smoker had previously undergone IM nailing for a transverse tibial fracture. Follow-up imaging showed no callus formation and a persistent fracture line. He required revision surgery with bone grafting and exchange nailing to achieve union.

  presenting_complaint: Redness, warmth, and purulent discharge from a surgical scar.
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old diabetic male presented three weeks post-ORIF with signs of deep surgical site infection. Cultures grew MRSA, necessitating implant removal, aggressive debridement, and a six-week course of targeted IV antibiotics via a PICC line.

fracture_of_lower_leg_ankle_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Tibial stress fracture (Acute-on-chronic)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden sharp pain in the shin during a marathon, following weeks of dull aching.
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old long-distance runner had ignored progressive pretibial pain. An MRI initially showed bone marrow oedema, but a subsequent X-ray after a sudden "pop" revealed a complete cortical break. He was treated with non-weight bearing and a gradual return-to-play protocol.

fracture_of_lower_leg_ankle_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Toddler's fracture
  presenting_complaint: Refusal to weight-bear after a minor trip.
  summary_of_course: A 22-month-old girl presented with no obvious deformity but cried when her leg was rotated. Initial X-rays were normal, but follow-up films ten days later showed a faint spiral fracture of the distal tibial shaft with periosteal reaction. She was managed in a long-leg cast for three weeks.

fracture_of_lower_leg_ankle_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Bimalleolar equivalent fracture
  presenting_complaint: Lateral ankle pain and significant medial swelling.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male sustained a lateral malleolus fracture with associated deltoid ligament rupture, evidenced by widening of the medial clear space on stress radiographs. He underwent ORIF of the fibula to restore the ankle mortise and syndesmotic stability.

  primary_diagnosis: Pathological fracture of the tibia
  presenting_complaint: Leg pain and inability to walk without a clear history of trauma.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer presented with a displaced mid-shaft tibial fracture. Imaging revealed an underlying lytic lesion. He was treated with an IM nail for stabilisation and referred for palliative radiotherapy and oncology review.

  presenting_complaint: Severe ankle deformity that could not be reduced in the ED.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male presented with a fracture-dislocation where the proximal fibular fragment was trapped behind the posterior tubercle of the tibia. Closed reduction failed repeatedly, necessitating urgent open reduction to prevent skin necrosis and neurovascular compromise.

fracture_of_lower_leg_ankle_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Juvenile Tillaux fracture
  presenting_complaint: Anterolateral ankle pain in an adolescent.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old male sustained an avulsion fracture of the anterolateral distal tibial epiphysis during a basketball game. CT scan showed 3mm of displacement, requiring percutaneous screw fixation to ensure articular surface congruity and prevent future osteoarthritis.

fracture_of_lower_leg_ankle_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Distal third tibial fracture with deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
  presenting_complaint: Calf swelling and tenderness two weeks after cast application.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female was being treated conservatively for a spiral tibial fracture. She presented with unilateral calf swelling; Doppler ultrasound confirmed a proximal DVT. She was started on therapeutic anticoagulation while continuing fracture management in a boot.

  presenting_complaint: Chronic ankle pain and visible deformity one year after injury.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male had declined surgery for a displaced ankle fracture and was lost to follow-up. He returned with significant valgus deformity and early-onset post-traumatic arthritis. He eventually required a corrective supramalleolar osteotomy and ankle arthrodesis.

  primary_diagnosis: Bilateral pilon fractures in polytrauma
  presenting_complaint: Multiple injuries following a fall from a third-floor balcony.

  presenting_complaint: Swollen, warm, but painless ankle in a patient with poorly controlled diabetes.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female presented with what appeared to be a standard ankle fracture on X-ray, but with minimal pain despite significant fragmentation. Clinical suspicion of Charcot led to offloading in a total contact cast and multidisciplinary diabetic foot team involvement to prevent amputation.

  primary_diagnosis: Complicated distal tibial fracture with fat embolism syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Confusion, breathlessness, and petechial rash 24 hours after a long-bone fracture.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male was awaiting surgery for a displaced tibial shaft fracture. He became acutely hypoxic and tachycardic with a drop in Glasgow Coma Scale. He was transferred to the ICU for supportive ventilation and eventually underwent delayed IM nailing once stable.
