normal_pressure_hydrocephalus_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus
  presenting_complaint: Progressive gait instability, urinary urgency, and mild cognitive decline over 18 months.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male presented with a classic "magnetic" gait and frequent falls. MRI brain showed ventriculomegaly with an Evan's index of 0.38 and disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid-space hydrocephalus (DESH). Following a positive CSF tap test showing significant improvement in walking speed, he underwent successful ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt insertion with resolution of urinary symptoms.

normal_pressure_hydrocephalus_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary normal pressure hydrocephalus
  presenting_complaint: Worsening memory loss and slow walking speed following a subarachnoid haemorrhage two years ago.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female with a history of aneurysmal SAH presented with subacute cognitive deterioration and gait apraxia. Neuropsychological testing confirmed executive dysfunction, and imaging showed ventriculomegaly out of proportion to cortical atrophy. She was diagnosed with secondary NPH and managed with a programmable VP shunt, resulting in moderate cognitive stabilization.

normal_pressure_hydrocephalus_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Normal pressure hydrocephalus with over-drainage complication
  presenting_complaint: Severe orthostatic headache and drowsiness three weeks post-shunt insertion.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male, previously shunted for NPH, presented acutely to the ED. CT head revealed bilateral subdural haematomas secondary to CSF over-drainage. The programmable shunt valve was adjusted to a higher pressure setting, and the haematomas were managed conservatively with bed rest, leading to gradual symptom resolution.

normal_pressure_hydrocephalus_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Early-stage idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus
  presenting_complaint: Mild balance issues and occasional urinary incontinence.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female was referred to the neurology outpatient clinic for "clumsiness." Examination revealed a wide-based gait and a MoCA score of 24/30. MRI confirmed early ventriculomegaly, and she is currently undergoing a three-day continuous lumbar drainage trial to confirm shunt candidacy.

normal_pressure_hydrocephalus_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Normal pressure hydrocephalus with comorbid Parkinson's disease
  presenting_complaint: Significant mobility decline and resting tremor.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male with known Parkinson's disease failed to respond to increased levodopa doses. Further investigation with MRI showed significant ventricular enlargement and upward bowing of the corpus callosum. A CSF tap test provided transient improvement in gait but not tremor, suggesting NPH as a co-existing contributor to his disability.

normal_pressure_hydrocephalus_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus
  presenting_complaint: Complete inability to ambulate and profound urinary incontinence.
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old male was admitted from a nursing home in a bedbound state with advanced dementia. Despite the severity, a lumbar infusion test showed high outflow resistance (Rout). Given his frailty and advanced stage, the family and MDT opted for palliative care rather than surgical intervention.

normal_pressure_hydrocephalus_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-traumatic normal pressure hydrocephalus
  presenting_complaint: Cognitive slowing and "heavy legs" following a traumatic brain injury.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male presented 18 months after a severe RTA with progressive difficulty in executive tasks and a shuffling gait. MRI showed ventriculomegaly with no evidence of obstructive pathology. He responded exceptionally well to a VP shunt, returning to part-time employment within six months.

normal_pressure_hydrocephalus_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Normal pressure hydrocephalus with shunt infection
  presenting_complaint: Fever, neck stiffness, and recurrence of gait symptoms post-shunting.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male presented acutely six weeks after VP shunt placement. CSF sampled from the shunt reservoir showed pleocytosis and grew Staphylococcus epidermidis. The shunt was externalised, and he completed a course of intrathecal and IV antibiotics before a new shunt was inserted on the contralateral side.

normal_pressure_hydrocephalus_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (Atypical presentation)
  presenting_complaint: Predominant psychiatric symptoms including apathy and social withdrawal.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female was initially treated for late-life depression with minimal response to SSRIs. Subsequent development of a short-stepped gait prompted an MRI, which revealed classic NPH features. Following shunt insertion, her apathy significantly improved, highlighting NPH as a reversible cause of "pseudodepression."

normal_pressure_hydrocephalus_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic normal pressure hydrocephalus
  presenting_complaint: Sudden inability to walk following a minor urinary tract infection.
  summary_of_course: A 77-year-old male with long-standing, stable gait issues experienced a rapid decline in mobility and consciousness during a systemic infection. While the UTI was treated, his mobility failed to return to baseline. A lumbar puncture showed an opening pressure of 14 cmH2O, and a large-volume tap led to immediate gait improvement, prompting shunt surgery.

normal_pressure_hydrocephalus_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Normal pressure hydrocephalus with vascular dementia
  presenting_complaint: Stepwise cognitive decline and gait apraxia.
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old female with hypertension and previous lacunar infarcts presented with mixed symptoms. MRI showed both ventriculomegaly and significant small vessel disease (Fazekas grade 3). A shunt was inserted but only provided minimal improvement in gait, likely limited by the extent of underlying vascular white matter damage.

normal_pressure_hydrocephalus_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Secondary normal pressure hydrocephalus (Post-meningitis)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic headaches and progressive memory impairment.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with a history of tuberculous meningitis in childhood presented with adult-onset cognitive decline. Investigations confirmed communicating hydrocephalus with normal opening pressure. He underwent a ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt due to extensive abdominal adhesions from previous surgeries, resulting in stabilized cognitive function.

normal_pressure_hydrocephalus_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (Mild severity)
  presenting_complaint: Occasional dizziness and "feeling off-balance" while turning.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male presented with vague balance complaints. Quantitative gait analysis revealed a reduced step height and increased cadence during turning. MRI showed an Evan's index of 0.32, and he is being monitored 6-monthly in the community to determine the optimal timing for surgical intervention.

normal_pressure_hydrocephalus_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Normal pressure hydrocephalus (Diagnostic challenge)
  presenting_complaint: Gait disturbance in the context of morbid obesity.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female (BMI 48) presented with symptoms suggestive of NPH. Initial lumbar puncture showed an opening pressure of 24 cmH2O, borderline for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). However, the presence of DESH on MRI and a positive response to a CSF tap test supported a diagnosis of NPH, and she was successfully treated with a programmable shunt.

normal_pressure_hydrocephalus_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Normal pressure hydrocephalus with shunt malfunction
  presenting_complaint: Return of urinary incontinence and falls 2 years after successful shunting.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male experienced a gradual return of his pre-operative triad. A shunt series (X-rays) showed a fracture in the distal peritoneal catheter. He underwent a shunt revision with replacement of the distal tubing, leading to a prompt return to his post-shunted baseline.

normal_pressure_hydrocephalus_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Normal pressure hydrocephalus (Edge case - Parkinsonian features)
  presenting_complaint: Gait freezing and mild resting tremor.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male presented with features mimicking progressive supranuclear palsy, including vertical gaze palsy and frequent back-falls. MRI was more suggestive of NPH than midbrain atrophy. A high-volume tap test resulted in a dramatic improvement in gait speed and a reduction in freezing episodes, confirming NPH.

normal_pressure_hydrocephalus_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (Post-op ICU admission)
  presenting_complaint: Post-operative seizure and decreased GCS following shunt insertion.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male underwent elective VP shunt insertion. Post-operatively, he suffered a focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic seizure; CT showed a small tract haemorrhage. He was managed in the ICU for 48 hours for neuro-observation and started on levetiracetam, eventually making a full recovery with significant improvement in his NPH symptoms.

normal_pressure_hydrocephalus_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Normal pressure hydrocephalus (Treatment failure)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent gait apraxia despite multiple shunt adjustments.
  summary_of_course: An 81-year-old male underwent VP shunting for NPH but showed no clinical benefit after 12 months. Despite lowering the programmable valve to the minimum setting, gait remained poor. Repeat MRI showed reduced ventricular size, suggesting the shunt was patent, but the lack of clinical response suggested irreversible subcortical damage or misdiagnosis.

normal_pressure_hydrocephalus_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (Community presentation)
  presenting_complaint: Frequent "mechanical" falls reported by family.
  summary_of_course: A 79-year-old male living alone was noted by his GP to have a wide-based, short-stepped gait and cognitive slowing. Community-based occupational therapy assessments highlighted safety concerns. He was fast-tracked for neurosurgical review, where MRI and tap test confirmed NPH, and he is now awaiting elective surgery.

normal_pressure_hydrocephalus_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Normal pressure hydrocephalus with comorbid Alzheimer's disease
  presenting_complaint: Severe memory loss and progressive walking difficulty.
  summary_of_course: An 83-year-old female with a prior diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (on donepezil) developed a new-onset shuffling gait. MRI showed ventriculomegaly disproportionate to her known hippocampal atrophy. While a VP shunt improved her mobility and reduced falls, her cognitive deficits remained unchanged, reflecting the dual pathology.
