  primary_diagnosis: Refractory ventricular fibrillation (E-CPR)
  presenting_complaint: Witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male had a witnessed cardiac arrest with ongoing VF. After 40 minutes of conventional CPR, he was transitioned to VA ECMO in the emergency department (Extracorporeal CPR). Subsequent coronary angiography revealed a proximal LAD occlusion which was stented; he was decannulated 3 days later with a Cerebral Performance Category score of 1.

extracorporeal_membrane_oxygenation_020:
  primary_diagnosis: North-South Syndrome (Harlequin Syndrome)
  presenting_complaint: Differential cyanosis while on VA ECMO
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female on VA ECMO for cardiogenic shock developed "Harlequin Syndrome," where the upper body received deoxygenated blood from the recovering heart while the lower body was well-oxygenated by the ECMO return. This was managed by reconfiguring the circuit to V-AV (veno-arteriovenous) ECMO, adding a venous return limb to the internal jugular vein to oxygenate the coronaries and brain.
