hyperprolactinaemia_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Microprolactinoma
  presenting_complaint: Secondary amenorrhoea and galactorrhoea
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old female presented to her GP with a six-month history of ceased menses and spontaneous milky nipple discharge. Serum prolactin was significantly elevated at 3,800 mIU/L, and MRI pituitary confirmed a 5mm microadenoma. She was started on cabergoline 250 micrograms twice weekly, leading to the restoration of regular menstruation and normalisation of prolactin levels within four months.

hyperprolactinaemia_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Macroprolactinoma
  presenting_complaint: Bitemporal hemianopia and chronic headaches
  summary_of_course: A 54-year-old male presented with progressive peripheral vision loss and worsening frontal headaches over one year. Investigations revealed a serum prolactin of 95,000 mIU/L and a 3.5cm pituitary macroadenoma compressing the optic chiasm. He was admitted for urgent initiation of high-dose dopamine agonists, which successfully reduced the tumour volume and improved his visual fields without the need for neurosurgery.

hyperprolactinaemia_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Risperidone-induced hyperprolactinaemia
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral breast tenderness and gynaecomastia
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia presented with painful breast enlargement after six months of risperidone therapy. Serum prolactin was 1,850 mIU/L, and MRI of the pituitary was unremarkable. Following consultation with his psychiatrist, his medication was switched to aripiprazole, resulting in a complete resolution of symptoms and normalisation of prolactin levels.

hyperprolactinaemia_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Macroprolactinaemia
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of elevated prolactin
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old asymptomatic female underwent blood tests for non-specific fatigue, which revealed a prolactin level of 2,400 mIU/L. Despite the lack of galactorrhoea or menstrual irregularity, a polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation test was performed, revealing that 85% of the prolactin was in the "big-big" (macroprolactin) form. No treatment was required as the monomeric (active) prolactin was within the reference range.

hyperprolactinaemia_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Stalk effect due to non-functioning pituitary adenoma
  presenting_complaint: Persistent headaches and mild libido loss
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male presented with chronic tension-type headaches and reduced sexual drive. Biochemistry showed a modestly elevated prolactin of 1,150 mIU/L, and MRI identified a 2.2cm non-secreting pituitary adenoma causing compression of the pituitary stalk. He underwent transsphenoidal resection of the mass, which resolved the stalk effect and returned prolactin levels to normal post-operatively.

hyperprolactinaemia_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Primary hypothyroidism with secondary hyperprolactinaemia
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue, weight gain, and oligomenorrhoea
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female presented with a three-month history of lethargy and irregular periods. Initial bloods showed a TSH of 110 mU/L and a prolactin of 1,600 mIU/L, likely due to TRH-mediated stimulation of lactotrophs. Following three months of levothyroxine replacement, her TSH normalised and the hyperprolactinaemia resolved completely without specific dopamine agonist therapy.

hyperprolactinaemia_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic kidney disease-associated hyperprolactinaemia
  presenting_complaint: Erectile dysfunction and pruritus
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with Stage 5 CKD on haemodialysis reported persistent erectile dysfunction. Investigations showed a prolactin level of 1,300 mIU/L, attributed to reduced renal clearance and altered dopaminergic tone. Given his comorbidities, he was managed conservatively with low-dose sildenafil, as MRI showed no evidence of a pituitary lesion and the prolactin elevation was deemed secondary to his renal failure.

hyperprolactinaemia_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Adolescent microprolactinoma
  presenting_complaint: Primary amenorrhoea and delayed puberty
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old girl was referred for investigation of primary amenorrhoea and lack of secondary sexual characteristics. Laboratory tests confirmed a prolactin of 4,200 mIU/L and low oestradiol levels, while MRI showed a 6mm pituitary microadenoma. Treatment with quinagolide was initiated, leading to the onset of menarche and appropriate pubertal progression over the following year.

hyperprolactinaemia_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-menopausal macroprolactinoma
  presenting_complaint: New-onset migraine-like headaches
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old post-menopausal female presented with severe, episodic headaches that were unresponsive to standard analgesia. MRI revealed a 1.2cm pituitary adenoma and serum prolactin was 5,500 mIU/L, a high level for her age group. She was started on cabergoline, which resulted in significant tumour shrinkage and complete resolution of her headaches within six months.

hyperprolactinaemia_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) with mild hyperprolactinaemia
  presenting_complaint: Hirsutism, acne, and irregular cycles
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old female presented with classic features of PCOS, including polycystic morphology on ultrasound and biochemical hyperandrogenism. Her prolactin was mildly elevated at 850 mIU/L, a common finding in PCOS due to oestrogen-mediated effects. She was managed with lifestyle modifications and the combined oral contraceptive pill, with no evidence of a pituitary adenoma on subsequent imaging.

hyperprolactinaemia_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Cabergoline-resistant macroprolactinoma
  presenting_complaint: Persistent galactorrhoea and enlarging pituitary mass
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female with a known 1.5cm macroprolactinoma failed to achieve prolactin normalisation despite escalating doses of cabergoline up to 4mg weekly. Repeat MRI showed the tumour had increased in size to 1.8cm, and prolactin remained above 6,000 mIU/L. She was subsequently referred for transsphenoidal surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy to control the resistant disease.

hyperprolactinaemia_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Pituitary apoplexy in a known prolactinoma
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset "thunderclap" headache and ptosis
  summary_of_course: A 47-year-old male with a previously diagnosed macroprolactinoma presented acutely to A&E with a severe headache, vomiting, and a right-sided third nerve palsy. MRI confirmed acute haemorrhage into the pituitary tumour (apoplexy), and serum prolactin had dropped from 20,000 to 1,200 mIU/L. He required emergency hydrocortisone for secondary adrenal insufficiency and urgent neurosurgical decompression.

hyperprolactinaemia_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Pregnancy-related pituitary enlargement
  presenting_complaint: Management of known microprolactinoma during pregnancy
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female with a 4mm microprolactinoma became pregnant while on cabergoline. As per guidelines, the dopamine agonist was discontinued at the first positive pregnancy test, and she was monitored clinically for symptoms of mass effect. Her prolactin rose physiologically to 9,000 mIU/L by the third trimester, but she remained asymptomatic and delivered a healthy infant at term without complications.

hyperprolactinaemia_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic hyperprolactinaemia
  presenting_complaint: Mild galactorrhoea and regular menses
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old female presented with intermittent, low-volume galactorrhoea but maintained regular 28-day menstrual cycles. Prolactin was persistently elevated between 900 and 1,100 mIU/L, yet three high-resolution MRI scans over five years showed no pituitary lesion. She remains under annual biochemical surveillance and requires no active treatment as her symptoms are minimal and bone density is normal.

hyperprolactinaemia_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Metoclopramide-induced acute hyperprolactinaemia
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of bilateral nipple discharge
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female was prescribed high-dose metoclopramide for post-operative nausea following a cholecystectomy. Within 48 hours, she developed significant galactorrhoea and a serum prolactin of 1,950 mIU/L. The symptoms and biochemical abnormality resolved completely within 72 hours of discontinuing the metoclopramide, confirming a drug-induced dopamine-antagonist effect.

hyperprolactinaemia_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Male infertility due to prolactinoma
  presenting_complaint: Inability to conceive and low libido
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male and his partner were investigated for primary infertility of two years' duration. Semen analysis showed oligospermia, and endocrine profile revealed a prolactin of 7,500 mIU/L with low testosterone and LH. MRI identified an 8mm microprolactinoma, and initiation of cabergoline led to the restoration of normal sperm parameters and a successful pregnancy within nine months.

hyperprolactinaemia_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Invasive macroprolactinoma with CSF rhinorrhoea
  presenting_complaint: Clear fluid leaking from the nose
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male presented with a persistent clear nasal drip that tasted salty, exacerbated by leaning forward. Investigations confirmed the fluid was cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and MRI showed a massive 4.5cm prolactinoma eroding the skull base into the sphenoid sinus. He required a combination of dopamine agonists to shrink the tumour and neurosurgical repair of the dural defect to prevent meningitis.

hyperprolactinaemia_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Verapamil-induced hyperprolactinaemia
  presenting_complaint: Loss of libido and mild breast enlargement
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male recently started on verapamil for hypertension presented with new-onset sexual dysfunction. Serum prolactin was 1,100 mIU/L and MRI pituitary was normal. His antihypertensive was switched to amlodipine, which resulted in the normalisation of prolactin levels and resolution of symptoms within six weeks, identifying the calcium channel blocker as the causative agent.

hyperprolactinaemia_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 (MEN1)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent kidney stones and galactorrhoea
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old male with a family history of endocrine tumours presented with nephrolithiasis and was found to have primary hyperparathyroidism. Further screening revealed a prolactin of 3,200 mIU/L and a 7mm pituitary microadenoma, alongside a pancreatic tail lesion. Genetic testing confirmed a mutation in the MEN1 gene, and his prolactinoma was successfully managed with cabergoline.

hyperprolactinaemia_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Stress-induced transient hyperprolactinaemia
  presenting_complaint: Borderline elevated prolactin on routine screening
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female athlete had a prolactin of 780 mIU/L (reference range <500) on a blood test taken immediately after a vigorous training session. A repeat test was performed using a cannulated "resting" protocol, where blood was drawn 20 minutes after needle insertion in a fasted, relaxed state. The repeat result was 310 mIU/L, confirming that the initial elevation was a physiological response to physical stress.
