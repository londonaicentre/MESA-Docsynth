idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
  presenting_complaint: Progressive breathlessness on exertion and dry cough for 18 months.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male presented with exertional dyspnoea and bilateral fine basal inspiratory 'velcro' crackles. HRCT demonstrated a definite UIP pattern with honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis. Pulmonary function tests showed a restrictive defect with an FVC of 68% predicted; he was commenced on Nintedanib 150mg BD with stable disease at 6-month follow-up.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Exacerbation of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
  presenting_complaint: Sudden worsening of shortness of breath and increased oxygen requirements over 72 hours.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with known IPF presented with acute respiratory failure. Chest X-ray showed new bilateral ground-glass opacities superimposed on chronic fibrotic changes. Despite high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone and broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected infection, her condition deteriorated, requiring high-flow nasal oxygen in the respiratory high dependency unit.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Early Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding of interstitial changes on CT coronary angiogram.
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old asymptomatic male underwent cardiac imaging for chest pain which revealed subpleural reticulation in the lung bases. Subsequent specialist review confirmed early IPF with a preserved FVC of 92% and DLCO of 74%. He was enrolled in a 'watch and wait' programme with 4-monthly spirometry to monitor for progression.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis with Secondary Pulmonary Hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Severe breathlessness at rest and peripheral oedema.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with long-standing IPF presented with signs of right-sided heart failure. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed an estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure of 55 mmHg and right ventricular hypertrophy. He was managed with diuretics and long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT), but prognosis remains poor due to the combination of advanced fibrosis and vascular complications.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Familial Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
  presenting_complaint: Persistent dry cough and mild dyspnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male with a strong family history of pulmonary fibrosis (father and paternal aunt) presented with early bibasilar crackles. HRCT showed a probable UIP pattern, and genetic testing identified a TERT mutation. He was started on Pirfenidone early in his disease course due to the high risk of rapid progression associated with his genotype.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Combined Pulmonary Fibrosis and Emphysema (CPFE)
  presenting_complaint: Significant breathlessness despite relatively preserved lung volumes on spirometry.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old heavy smoker presented with severe exertional dyspnoea. Imaging revealed upper zone centrilobular emphysema and lower zone subpleural fibrosis consistent with UIP. While his FVC was 88%, his DLCO was disproportionately low at 35%, highlighting the physiological impact of the combined pathologies.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis with Nintedanib-induced Hepatotoxicity
  presenting_complaint: New onset jaundice, nausea, and right upper quadrant pain.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old female treated with Nintedanib for 3 months presented with deranged liver function tests (ALT 450 U/L). Antifibrotic therapy was suspended immediately, and her LFTs normalised over four weeks. She was subsequently transitioned to Pirfenidone at a titrated dose, which she tolerated without further gastrointestinal or hepatic complications.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: End-stage Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
  presenting_complaint: Refractory dyspnoea and cough at the end of life.
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old male with severe IPF (FVC 35%) was admitted for palliative symptom management. He was no longer a candidate for active treatment or transplantation and was managed with low-dose morphine oramorph for breathlessness and sublingual lorazepam for associated anxiety. He passed away peacefully in the hospital hospice suite four days after admission.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis with Lung Adenocarcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Haemoptysis and weight loss on a background of chronic cough.
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male with known IPF presented with a 2cm spiculated nodule in the right upper lobe on routine surveillance CT. PET-CT confirmed metabolic activity, and biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma. Treatment options were limited by his poor respiratory reserve (FVC 55%), leading to a decision for stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) rather than surgical resection.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis with Acute Spontaneous Pneumothorax
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset pleuritic chest pain and acute worsening of dyspnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 73-year-old male with moderate IPF presented to A&E with a 30% right-sided pneumothorax. Due to the underlying fibrotic lung disease and poor compliance, the pneumothorax failed to resolve with a simple chest drain. He required video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and pleurodesis, which was complicated by a prolonged air leak and hospital stay.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis with Gastro-oesophageal Reflux Disease (GORD)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic nocturnal cough and retrosternal burning.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old female with IPF was found to have severe GORD on pH monitoring, suspected to be an aggravating factor for her lung disease. She was treated with high-dose proton pump inhibitors and lifestyle modifications to reduce the risk of micro-aspiration. Her lung function remained stable over the following 12 months, suggesting a potential benefit from aggressive reflux management.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Rapidly Progressive Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
  presenting_complaint: Marked decline in exercise tolerance over a 3-month period.
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old female experienced a rapid decline in FVC from 75% to 50% within 12 weeks. Despite being on Pirfenidone, her condition worsened, and she was urgently referred to the regional transplant centre. She was placed on the super-urgent lung transplant list due to her rapid physiological deterioration and lack of response to medical therapy.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA)
  presenting_complaint: Excessive daytime somnolence and heavy snoring.
  summary_of_course: A 76-year-old male with IPF and a BMI of 34 underwent an overnight sleep study revealing an Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index (AHI) of 25. He was commenced on CPAP therapy, which significantly improved his daytime fatigue and quality of life. Management of his OSA was integrated with his ongoing antifibrotic treatment and pulmonary rehabilitation.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis with Chronic Type 2 Respiratory Failure
  presenting_complaint: Morning headaches and increasing lethargy.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with advanced IPF (FVC 40%) developed hypercapnia on arterial blood gas (pCO2 6.8 kPa). He was evaluated for non-invasive ventilation (NIV) to assist with nocturnal ventilation. While NIV provided some symptomatic relief for his headaches, his overall prognosis remained guarded due to the severity of his restrictive lung disease.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis with Pirfenidone-induced Photosensitivity
  presenting_complaint: Severe erythematous rash on the face and hands following sun exposure.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male on Pirfenidone developed a significant confluent rash despite using SPF 50 sunscreen. The medication was temporarily withheld until the rash resolved and then restarted at a lower dose with strict sun avoidance advice. Due to recurrence of the rash, he was eventually switched to Nintedanib, which he tolerated well.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis with Pulmonary Embolism
  presenting_complaint: Acute pleuritic pain and tachycardia.
  summary_of_course: A 71-year-old female with IPF presented with a sudden increase in breathlessness. CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) revealed bilateral segmental pulmonary emboli. She was commenced on anticoagulation with apixaban, though her recovery was limited by her pre-existing low respiratory reserve and underlying fibrosis.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Moderate Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (Diagnostic Challenge)
  presenting_complaint: Dry cough and exertional dyspnoea with atypical HRCT features.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male had HRCT findings of "Indeterminate for UIP" with some mosaic attenuation. An MDT discussion involving radiology, pathology, and pulmonology led to a surgical lung biopsy, which confirmed a UIP pattern. He was subsequently diagnosed with IPF and commenced on antifibrotic therapy.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis with Ischaemic Heart Disease
  presenting_complaint: Exertional chest tightness and breathlessness.
  summary_of_course: A 78-year-old male with IPF and multiple cardiovascular risk factors was found to have significant coronary artery disease on angiography. His management required careful balance between beta-blockers, which could potentially worsen his breathlessness, and his antifibrotic regimen. He underwent successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and continued Nintedanib without adverse events.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis in a Former Asbestos Worker
  presenting_complaint: Progressive dyspnoea and digital clubbing.
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old male with historical asbestos exposure presented with basal fibrosis. HRCT showed a UIP pattern but no pleural plaques or thickening; the MDT concluded the clinical features were more consistent with IPF than asbestosis. He was successfully processed for Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit while receiving standard IPF care.

idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis with Recurrent Chest Infections
  presenting_complaint: Increased sputum production and fever on a background of IPF.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female with moderate IPF suffered from three lower respiratory tract infections in six months. Sputum cultures grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa, requiring targeted antibiotic therapy. Her frequent infections led to a step-decline in her FVC, necessitating a review of her immunisation status and a referral to the community respiratory nursing team for enhanced monitoring.
