  presenting_complaint: Excessive daytime sleepiness and morning headaches.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with a BMI of 42 kg/m² presented to his GP with persistent fatigue. ABG showed a daytime PaCO2 of 6.2 kPa and bicarbonate of 29 mmol/L, confirming OHS alongside OSA. He was commenced on nocturnal CPAP with significant improvement in daytime alertness and reduction in headaches.

obesity_hypoventilation_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to OHS
  presenting_complaint: Acute breathlessness, confusion, and peripheral oedema.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female with a BMI of 52 kg/m² was admitted via A&E with somnolence and a pH of 7.24, PaCO2 9.5 kPa. She was managed in the ICU with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) for decompensated OHS. Following stabilisation, she was transitioned to home BiPAP and referred to the specialist weight management service.

obesity_hypoventilation_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Mild Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Shortness of breath on exertion and snoring.
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old woman with PCOS and a BMI of 38 kg/m² was reviewed in the respiratory clinic. Investigations revealed a restrictive pattern on spirometry and a borderline daytime PaCO2 of 6.1 kPa. She was diagnosed with mild OHS and started on a supervised weight loss programme and nocturnal CPAP.

obesity_hypoventilation_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Poor school performance and nocturnal gasping.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old boy with Prader-Willi syndrome and severe obesity (BMI centile >99th) presented with daytime hypercapnia (PaCO2 6.4 kPa).

obesity_hypoventilation_005:
  primary_diagnosis: OHS with Cor Pulmonale
  presenting_complaint: Worsening bilateral leg swelling and orthopnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old man with a BMI of 46 kg/m² presented with clinical signs of right heart failure. Echocardiography showed pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy, while ABG confirmed chronic hypercapnia (PaCO2 7.1 kPa). He was treated with diuretics and long-term nocturnal NIV, showing gradual improvement in his heart failure symptoms.

obesity_hypoventilation_006:
  primary_diagnosis: OHS with secondary polycythaemia
  presenting_complaint: Ruddy complexion and exertional dyspnoea.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male smoker with a BMI of 40 kg/m² was found to have a high haemoglobin (195 g/L) and haematocrit. Further testing ruled out primary erythrocytosis, but ABG showed daytime hypoxia and hypercapnia (PaCO2 6.5 kPa). Diagnosis of OHS was made, and nocturnal NIV led to the normalisation of his red cell indices over six months.

obesity_hypoventilation_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-operative hypercapnic respiratory failure in OHS
  presenting_complaint: Delayed emergence from anaesthesia and low oxygen saturations.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old woman with undiagnosed OHS (BMI 49 kg/m²) underwent elective cholecystectomy. Post-operatively, she remained hypercapnic (PaCO2 8.8 kPa) and required unplanned admission to the High Dependency Unit for NIV. She was later discharged with a formal diagnosis of OHS and a home BiPAP machine.

obesity_hypoventilation_008:
  primary_diagnosis: OHS misdiagnosed as COPD
  presenting_complaint: Chronic cough and breathlessness non-responsive to inhalers.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old non-smoking female with a BMI of 44 kg/m² had been treated for COPD for five years without benefit. Pulmonary function tests showed restriction rather than obstruction, and ABG confirmed hypercapnia (PaCO2 6.3 kPa). Inhalers were stopped, and she was successfully managed with weight loss and CPAP.

obesity_hypoventilation_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe OHS (Pickwickian Syndrome) with hypercapnic coma
  presenting_complaint: Unresponsiveness and cyanosis.
  summary_of_course: A 42-year-old male with a BMI of 65 kg/m² was brought to A&E in a comatose state with a PaCO2 of 14.2 kPa. He required emergency intubation and mechanical ventilation in the ICU. After a difficult weaning process, he was stabilised on high-pressure BiPAP and referred for bariatric surgery assessment.

obesity_hypoventilation_010:
  primary_diagnosis: OHS with treatment non-compliance
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent hospital admissions with respiratory failure.
  summary_of_course: A 53-year-old woman with OHS (BMI 47 kg/m²) struggled with BiPAP mask tolerance due to claustrophobia. Despite multiple mask fittings and psychological support, her PaCO2 remained elevated at 7.5 kPa, leading to frequent acute-on-chronic episodes. She is currently being considered for a tracheostomy to facilitate long-term ventilation.

obesity_hypoventilation_011:
  primary_diagnosis: OHS and HFpEF overlap
  presenting_complaint: Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea and fatigue.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with a BMI of 39 kg/m² and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) showed persistent hypercapnia despite optimised cardiac meds. Sleep studies confirmed OHS with significant nocturnal desaturation. The introduction of nocturnal NIV improved his exercise tolerance and reduced his NT-proBNP levels.

obesity_hypoventilation_012:
  primary_diagnosis: OHS triggered by Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP)
  presenting_complaint: Fever, productive cough, and extreme drowsiness.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old man with a BMI of 43 kg/m² developed CAP, which precipitated acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (PaCO2 9.0 kPa). While the infection was treated with antibiotics, his hypercapnia persisted after resolution of the pneumonia, confirming underlying OHS. He was discharged on home NIV.

obesity_hypoventilation_013:
  primary_diagnosis: OHS with metabolic alkalosis compensation
  presenting_complaint: Routine pre-operative assessment for knee arthroplasty.
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old woman with a BMI of 41 kg/m² was found to have a venous bicarbonate of 34 mmol/L during pre-op screening. Subsequent ABG confirmed a daytime PaCO2 of 6.6 kPa. Her surgery was postponed until she was stabilised on CPAP, which successfully reduced her surgical risk profile.

obesity_hypoventilation_014:
  primary_diagnosis: OHS in a patient with Hypothyroidism
  presenting_complaint: Profound lethargy and weight gain.
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female with poorly controlled hypothyroidism and a BMI of 45 kg/m² presented with daytime somnolence. Despite achieving euthyroidism with levothyroxine, her hypercapnia (PaCO2 6.4 kPa) persisted. She was diagnosed with OHS and showed significant improvement once nocturnal NIV was added to her treatment regimen.

obesity_hypoventilation_015:
  primary_diagnosis: OHS with severe Pulmonary Hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Syncope on exertion and chest tightness.
  summary_of_course: A 51-year-old male with a BMI of 48 kg/m² underwent right heart catheterisation which revealed a mean pulmonary artery pressure of 45 mmHg. ABG showed chronic hypercapnia (PaCO2 7.4 kPa). He was started on BiPAP and sildenafil, resulting in improved haemodynamics and functional capacity over 12 months.

obesity_hypoventilation_016:
  primary_diagnosis: OHS with nocturnal hypoventilation predominant
  presenting_complaint: Waking up gasping for air and unrefreshing sleep.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old woman with a BMI of 42 kg/m² had normal daytime PaCO2 (5.8 kPa) but significant nocturnal hypercapnia on transcutaneous CO2 monitoring. This "early-stage" OHS was treated with CPAP to prevent progression to daytime respiratory failure, alongside a focus on bariatric medicine referral.

obesity_hypoventilation_017:
  primary_diagnosis: OHS in a patient with limited mobility
  presenting_complaint: Increasing breathlessness while sedentary.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male, wheelchair-bound due to severe osteoarthritis, had a BMI of 40 kg/m². His lack of physical activity exacerbated his OHS, leading to a PaCO2 of 6.9 kPa. Due to his inability to exercise, management focused on strict calorie restriction and nocturnal NIV, which stabilised his respiratory status.

obesity_hypoventilation_018:
  primary_diagnosis: OHS with hypercapnic encephalopathy
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset of flapping tremor (asterixis) and disorientation.
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male with a BMI of 50 kg/m² was brought to the hospital by family due to personality changes. ABG revealed a PaCO2 of 10.5 kPa and pH 7.28. He was treated with emergent NIV for hypercapnic encephalopathy secondary to OHS, with rapid resolution of neurological symptoms.

obesity_hypoventilation_019:
  primary_diagnosis: OHS following rapid weight gain
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly worsening dyspnoea over six months.
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old man who gained 30kg following a depressive episode (current BMI 44 kg/m²) developed new-onset OHS symptoms. ABG confirmed a PaCO2 of 6.5 kPa. He was started on BiPAP and referred for cognitive behavioural therapy and intensive weight management, leading to a partial reversal of hypercapnia after a 15kg weight loss.

obesity_hypoventilation_020:
  primary_diagnosis: OHS with Type 2 Diabetes and CKD
  presenting_complaint: Generalised malaise and fluid retention.
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old male with multiple comorbidities and a BMI of 43 kg/m² was found to have chronic hypercapnia (PaCO2 6.7 kPa) during a renal clinic review. The combination of CKD-related metabolic acidosis and OHS-related respiratory acidosis created a complex acid-base picture. He was managed with nocturnal NIV and careful titration of his diabetic and renal medications.
