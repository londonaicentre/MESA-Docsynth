hypotension_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Drug-induced orthostatic hypotension
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent dizziness and lightheadedness upon standing
  summary_of_course: An 82-year-old female with hypertension and heart failure presented with frequent near-syncopal episodes. Clinical examination revealed a postural blood pressure drop of 35/15 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing. Her medications, specifically amlodipine and bendroflumethiazide, were titrated downwards, resulting in resolution of symptoms and stabilisation of standing BP at 125/80 mmHg.

hypotension_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Septic shock secondary to urosepsis
  presenting_complaint: Rigors, confusion, and extreme lethargy
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male was admitted to the ICU with a BP of 82/44 mmHg and a heart rate of 120 bpm. Investigations confirmed E. coli bacteraemia originating from a urinary tract infection; despite aggressive fluid resuscitation with 3L of Hartmann's solution, he remained hypotensive. Management required noradrenaline infusion and intravenous ceftriaxone, leading to gradual haemodynamic recovery over 72 hours.

hypotension_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Anaphylactic shock
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset wheeze, facial swelling, and collapse
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old girl with a known peanut allergy accidentally ingested a satay sauce and rapidly became hypotensive (BP 70/35 mmHg) with audible stridor. She was treated urgently with intramuscular adrenaline (1:1000), high-flow oxygen, and intravenous fluid boluses. Her blood pressure normalised within 20 minutes, and she was monitored for 24 hours for biphasic reactions.

hypotension_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Haemorrhagic shock (Grade IV)
  presenting_complaint: Profuse bleeding and loss of consciousness following a road traffic accident
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male sustained a complex pelvic fracture and splenic rupture, presenting with a BP of 65/30 mmHg and thready pulse. The major haemorrhage protocol was activated, involving transfusion of 6 units of packed red cells, 4 units of FFP, and cryoprecipitate. Emergency laparotomy and pelvic binding were performed to achieve surgical haemostasis, successfully restoring normotension.

hypotension_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Cardiogenic shock post-myocardial infarction
  presenting_complaint: Severe retrosternal chest pain and cold, clammy peripheries
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male with an acute anterior STEMI developed profound hypotension (BP 85/50 mmHg) and pulmonary oedema. Echocardiography showed a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 25% with global hypokinesis. He was managed with urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), dobutamine infusion, and an intra-aortic balloon pump to support cardiac output.

hypotension_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute Addisonian crisis
  presenting_complaint: Unexplained vomiting, abdominal pain, and profound weakness
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old female with a history of vitiligo presented in a state of collapse with a BP of 88/52 mmHg. Laboratory tests revealed hyponatraemia (128 mmol/L) and hyperkalaemia (5.9 mmol/L), raising suspicion of primary adrenal insufficiency. She responded rapidly to intravenous hydrocortisone and 0.9% saline, with subsequent Short Synacthen Test confirming the diagnosis.

hypotension_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Neurogenic shock
  presenting_complaint: Loss of sensation and motor function below the chest following a fall
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male sustained a T4 spinal cord injury after falling from a height, presenting with a BP of 80/40 mmHg and a paradoxical bradycardia of 45 bpm. Unlike other forms of shock, his peripheries were warm due to loss of sympathetic vascular tone. He required vasopressors (metaraminol) and atropine to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 85 mmHg for spinal cord perfusion.

hypotension_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Vasovagal syncope
  presenting_complaint: Transient loss of consciousness during a blood test
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old healthy female experienced a brief episode of hypotension (BP 85/45 mmHg) and bradycardia while undergoing venepuncture. She regained consciousness within seconds of being placed in the Trendelenburg position. No further intervention was required other than reassurance and advice on isometric counter-pressure manoeuvres for future episodes.

hypotension_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Severe hypovolaemic shock (paediatric)
  presenting_complaint: Sunken eyes, dry mucous membranes, and lethargy
  summary_of_course: An 18-month-old male with a 3-day history of rotavirus gastroenteritis presented with a BP of 60/30 mmHg and delayed capillary refill time of 5 seconds. He received three 20ml/kg boluses of 0.9% sodium chloride to restore circulating volume. Following initial stabilisation, he was transitioned to oral rehydration therapy and made a full recovery.

hypotension_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Pure Autonomic Failure (PAF)
  presenting_complaint: Chronic, debilitating dizziness and recurrent falls
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male reported a 2-year history of progressive lightheadedness when upright, with no associated tremors or cognitive decline. Formal tilt-table testing demonstrated a sustained fall in BP from 140/85 mmHg (supine) to 70/40 mmHg (standing) without a compensatory heart rate increase. Management included high salt intake, compression stockings, and pharmacological support with midodrine and fludrocortisone.

hypotension_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Postprandial hypotension
  presenting_complaint: Drowsiness and dizziness occurring 45 minutes after meals
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old female with Parkinson's disease noted frequent episodes of feeling faint specifically after eating large, carbohydrate-rich lunches. Ambulatory BP monitoring confirmed drops of >20 mmHg systolic post-ingestion. Symptoms improved significantly by switching to smaller, more frequent meals and consuming a caffeinated beverage with breakfast and lunch.

hypotension_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Beta-blocker toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Bradycardia and hypotension following intentional ingestion
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male was brought to the ED after taking an overdose of propranolol. He was hypotensive (BP 75/40 mmHg) and bradycardic (HR 32 bpm), unresponsive to initial atropine. Treatment escalated to high-dose insulin euglycaemia therapy and intravenous glucagon, which successfully increased his heart rate and blood pressure over several hours.

hypotension_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Supine hypotensive syndrome of pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Nausea and feeling faint during an obstetric ultrasound
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old female at 36 weeks gestation became pale and diaphoretic while lying flat for a scan, with her BP dropping to 85/50 mmHg. The symptoms were attributed to the gravid uterus compressing the inferior vena cava, reducing venous return. Immediate repositioning to the left lateral tilt position restored her BP to 115/75 mmHg and resolved the symptoms.

hypotension_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Intradialytic hypotension
  presenting_complaint: Muscle cramps and dizziness during haemodialysis
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old female with end-stage renal disease frequently experienced BP drops to 80/50 mmHg during the final hour of her dialysis sessions. This was managed by adjusting the ultrafiltration rate, cooling the dialysate to 35.5°C, and advising the patient to avoid large meals immediately before or during treatment.

hypotension_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Massive Pulmonary Embolism (Obstructive shock)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male, three days post-total knee replacement, became acutely hypotensive (BP 85/55 mmHg) and hypoxic. CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) revealed a large saddle embolus obstructing the pulmonary arteries. Due to haemodynamic instability, he underwent emergency thrombolysis with alteplase, resulting in rapid improvement of his blood pressure and respiratory status.

hypotension_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Tension pneumothorax
  presenting_complaint: Severe respiratory distress and deviated trachea
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male sustained a penetrating chest wound and presented with absent breath sounds on the right side and a BP of 70/30 mmHg. The clinical diagnosis of tension pneumothorax was made, and immediate needle decompression was performed in the second intercostal space, mid-clavicular line. A subsequent chest drain was inserted, and his BP immediately rose to 110/70 mmHg.

hypotension_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-anaesthetic hypotension
  presenting_complaint: Low blood pressure readings in the recovery room
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old female underwent an elective hip replacement under spinal anaesthesia. In the Post-Anaesthetic Care Unit (PACU), her BP was noted to be 90/50 mmHg despite being asymptomatic. This was attributed to the residual vasodilatory effects of the spinal block and mild intraoperative fluid loss; she was treated with a 500ml bolus of crystalloid, which restored her BP to her baseline of 120/75 mmHg.

hypotension_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Cardiac Tamponade
  presenting_complaint: Muffled heart sounds, distended neck veins, and low BP (Beck's Triad)
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female, one week post-CABG, presented with increasing dyspnoea and a BP of 80/60 mmHg with a pulsus paradoxus of 20 mmHg. Echocardiography confirmed a large pericardial effusion with right ventricular collapse during diastole. Emergency ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis was performed, draining 400ml of serosanguinous fluid and immediately resolving the hypotension.

hypotension_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Myxoedema coma
  presenting_complaint: Hypothermia, bradycardia, and altered mental status
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female was found in a semi-comatose state with a core temperature of 33.5°C and a BP of 85/45 mmHg. Blood results showed a TSH >100 mIU/L and an undetectable free T4. She was treated with intravenous levothyroxine, liothyronine, and stress-dose hydrocortisone in the ICU, with slow improvement in her haemodynamic and metabolic parameters.

hypotension_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic over-diuresis
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue and rising creatinine levels
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with chronic heart failure was prescribed high-dose furosemide (80mg BD) following an exacerbation. He presented to the clinic with a BP of 90/60 mmHg (baseline 130/80) and biochemical evidence of pre-renal uraemia (Urea 18 mmol/L, Creatinine 160 µmol/L). His diuretic dose was reduced, and he was advised on fluid intake, leading to the normalisation of both BP and renal function.
