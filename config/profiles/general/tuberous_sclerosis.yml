tuberous_sclerosis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Tuberous Sclerosis Complex with West Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Infantile spasms and developmental regression
  summary_of_course: A 6-month-old male presented with clusters of flexor spasms. EEG demonstrated hypsarrhythmia, and MRI brain revealed multiple cortical tubers and subependymal nodules. He was diagnosed with TSC1-related tuberous sclerosis and commenced on vigabatrin, which resulted in cessation of spasms and improvement in developmental milestones.

tuberous_sclerosis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) in Tuberous Sclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Progressive exertional dyspnoea and dry cough
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old female with known TSC and mild learning disabilities presented with worsening shortness of breath. High-resolution CT chest showed diffuse thin-walled cystic lung disease consistent with LAM. Pulmonary function tests revealed an obstructive defect, and she was started on sirolimus to stabilise her lung function.

tuberous_sclerosis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma (SEGA)
  presenting_complaint: Morning headaches and projectile vomiting
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old boy with TSC presented with signs of raised intracranial pressure. Neuroimaging identified a 2.5cm SEGA at the Foramen of Monro causing obstructive hydrocephalus. He underwent urgent ventriculoperitoneal shunting followed by the initiation of everolimus, which successfully reduced the tumour volume.

tuberous_sclerosis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Ruptured Renal Angiomyolipoma (AML)
  presenting_complaint: Acute onset left flank pain and hypotension
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with a history of facial angiofibromas presented in hypovolaemic shock. CT abdomen revealed a 12cm ruptured renal AML with retroperitoneal haemorrhage (Wunderlich syndrome). He underwent emergency selective arterial embolisation to control the bleeding, followed by a period of stabilisation in the ICU.

tuberous_sclerosis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: TSC2/PKD1 Contiguous Gene Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Severe hypertension and abdominal distension
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old girl presented with significant hypertension and palpable bilateral abdominal masses. Genetic testing confirmed a deletion involving both TSC2 and PKD1 genes. She is managed for both tuberous sclerosis and early-onset polycystic kidney disease, requiring multiple antihypertensive agents and regular renal ultrasound monitoring.

tuberous_sclerosis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Refractory Focal Epilepsy in Tuberous Sclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Frequent focal impaired awareness seizures
  summary_of_course: An 18-year-old male with TSC2 mutation experienced daily seizures despite trials of levetiracetam, carbamazepine, and sodium valproate. Video-EEG telemetry localised the seizure onset to a large tuber in the right frontal lobe. Following multidisciplinary review, he underwent a Vagus Nerve Stimulator (VNS) insertion which reduced seizure frequency by 40%.

tuberous_sclerosis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Cardiac Rhabdomyoma in Neonatal TSC
  presenting_complaint: Antenatal detection of cardiac masses
  summary_of_course: A neonate was born following antenatal ultrasound findings of multiple intracardiac tumours. Postnatal echocardiography confirmed multiple rhabdomyomas, the largest involving the left ventricular outflow tract but not causing significant obstruction. The patient remained asymptomatic, and follow-up scans showed spontaneous regression of the lesions by age two.

tuberous_sclerosis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Tuberous Sclerosis-Associated Neuropsychiatric Disorders (TAND)
  presenting_complaint: Severe aggressive behaviour and social withdrawal
  summary_of_course: A 9-year-old boy with TSC and known autism spectrum disorder presented with escalating self-injurious behaviours. Clinical assessment focused on the TAND framework, identifying significant anxiety and ADHD. A combination of behavioural therapy and risperidone was implemented, leading to improved stability in his specialist school setting.

tuberous_sclerosis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Facial Angiofibromas (TSC)
  presenting_complaint: Disfiguring facial papules and occasional bleeding
  summary_of_course: A 24-year-old woman presented with extensive malar angiofibromas causing significant psychological distress. She had no history of seizures and normal renal imaging. She was treated with topical 0.1% rapamycin cream, which resulted in a marked reduction in the size and vascularity of the lesions over six months.

tuberous_sclerosis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Mosaic Tuberous Sclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Multiple hypomelanotic macules (ash-leaf spots)
  summary_of_course: A 15-year-old girl was referred for skin depigmentation. Initial blood genetic testing for TSC1/TSC2 was negative, but skin biopsy of a lesion revealed a low-level TSC2 mutation. Further screening identified small subependymal nodules, confirming a diagnosis of mosaic tuberous sclerosis with a relatively mild phenotype.

tuberous_sclerosis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic Kidney Disease secondary to TSC
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue and routine blood test abnormalities
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with TSC and multiple bilateral renal AMLs presented with a rising serum creatinine of 210 µmol/L. Imaging showed extensive replacement of normal renal parenchyma by fat-containing lesions and cysts. He was started on an mTOR inhibitor to prevent further AML growth and preserve remaining renal function.

tuberous_sclerosis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Status Epilepticus in Tuberous Sclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Prolonged generalised tonic-clonic seizure
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old girl with severe intellectual disability and TSC was brought to A&E in status epilepticus. Despite pre-hospital diazepam, seizures continued, requiring a midazolam infusion and intubation in the paediatric ICU. Seizures were eventually controlled with a loading dose of fosphenytoin and an increase in her baseline topiramate.

tuberous_sclerosis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Retinal Astrocytic Hamartoma
  presenting_complaint: Routine ophthalmic screening
  summary_of_course: During a routine annual review for a 10-year-old boy with TSC, fundoscopy revealed a "mulberry-like" calcified lesion on the optic nerve head. The lesion was asymptomatic and did not affect visual acuity. No intervention was required, but the finding provided further diagnostic criteria for his TSC management.

tuberous_sclerosis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Periungual Fibromas (Koenen Tumours)
  presenting_complaint: Painful growths on toenails
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old male presented with multiple firm, flesh-coloured tumours arising from the nail folds of his feet, causing difficulty wearing shoes. These were identified as Koenen tumours, a hallmark of TSC. He underwent surgical excision of the largest fibromas with successful wound healing and symptomatic relief.

tuberous_sclerosis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Spontaneous Pneumothorax in TSC-LAM
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset pleuritic chest pain
  summary_of_course: A 29-year-old non-smoking female with TSC presented with acute breathlessness. Chest X-ray confirmed a large right-sided pneumothorax, which was treated with a chest drain. Subsequent CT imaging confirmed underlying LAM, and she was referred for pleurodesis due to the high risk of recurrence in this patient group.

tuberous_sclerosis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Dental Enamel Pitting in TSC
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding during dental check-up
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male was noted by his dentist to have multiple pitted defects in his dental enamel. This prompted a referral to genetics, where a physical exam identified a Shagreen patch on his lower back. MRI brain later confirmed several subependymal nodules, establishing a late diagnosis of TSC.

tuberous_sclerosis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) in Tuberous Sclerosis
  presenting_complaint: Macroscopic haematuria
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old woman with TSC and a history of renal cysts presented with blood in her urine. Imaging showed a solid, enhancing mass within the upper pole of the left kidney, distinct from her known AMLs. She underwent a nephron-sparing partial nephrectomy, and histology confirmed a chromophobe renal cell carcinoma.

tuberous_sclerosis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Everolimus-induced Stomatitis in TSC
  presenting_complaint: Painful mouth ulcers
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old boy being treated with everolimus for a SEGA developed severe grade 3 oral mucositis. The medication was temporarily withheld until the ulcers healed, and then restarted at a lower dose with prophylactic dexamethasone mouthwash. This allowed for continued tumour suppression without further significant toxicity.

tuberous_sclerosis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: TSC with Intractable Epilepsy and Ketogenic Diet
  presenting_complaint: Failure of multiple anti-seizure medications
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old child with TSC2 mutation and daily focal seizures failed five different medications. She was started on a 3:1 ratio ketogenic diet under the supervision of a specialist dietitian. Within three months, her seizure burden reduced by 70%, and she showed improved alertness and cognitive engagement.

tuberous_sclerosis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Pregnancy-related Renal AML Growth
  presenting_complaint: Routine obstetric monitoring in TSC patient
  summary_of_course: A 27-year-old pregnant woman with TSC had known small renal AMLs. Serial ultrasounds during the second trimester showed rapid enlargement of a right-sided AML to 6cm, likely due to hormonal influences. She was managed with close surveillance and blood pressure control, successfully delivering a healthy infant via elective caesarean section at 37 weeks.
