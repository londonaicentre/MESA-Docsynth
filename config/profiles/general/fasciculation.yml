EMG showed characteristic doublet and triplet discharges (fasciculations and myokymia). Serum testing was positive for voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC) antibodies, and he responded well to plasma exchange and carbamazepine.

fasciculation_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Salbutamol toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Tachycardia and limb twitching following asthma exacerbation
  summary_of_course: A 21-year-old female was admitted with an acute asthma attack, having used her salbutamol inhaler excessively. On admission, she was tachycardic (130 bpm) with fine fasciculations noted in the small muscles of the hands. Biochemistry showed a serum potassium of 2.6 mmol/L; symptoms resolved as the salbutamol was titrated down and potassium was replaced.

fasciculation_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Caffeine-induced fasciculation
  presenting_complaint: Eyelid twitching and palpitations
  summary_of_course: A 25-year-old medical student presented during finals week with a persistent "jumping" sensation in her left eyelid (myokymia) and occasional thigh fasciculations. History revealed an intake of 8-10 cups of espresso daily and poor sleep hygiene. Symptoms completely resolved within two weeks of reducing caffeine intake to one cup per day.

fasciculation_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-polio syndrome
  presenting_complaint: New onset fatigue and muscle twitching in a previously stable limb
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male, who had paralytic polio as a child, presented with new-found weakness and visible fasciculations in his right leg, which had been stable for 50 years. After excluding other neurological pathologies, a diagnosis of post-polio syndrome was made. Management focused on energy conservation and orthotic support.

  primary_diagnosis: Lithium toxicity
  presenting_complaint: Coarse tremor, ataxia, and muscle twitching
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old patient with bipolar disorder presented with confusion and vomiting following a bout of gastroenteritis. Examination revealed a coarse tremor and multifocal fasciculations in the upper limbs. Serum lithium was found to be 2.4 mmol/L; he was treated with aggressive intravenous hydration and temporary cessation of lithium.

fasciculation_014:

  presenting_complaint: Numbness and muscle rippling during chemotherapy
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old male undergoing treatment for lung cancer developed pins and needles in his feet and noticeable twitching in his calves. Clinical assessment and EMG suggested a sensory-motor neuropathy with secondary fasciculations related to cisplatin neurotoxicity. The chemotherapy regimen was adjusted, and gabapentin was started for symptomatic relief.

  primary_diagnosis: Severe hypernatraemic dehydration
  presenting_complaint: Confusion and widespread muscle twitching in the elderly
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old female resident of a care home was admitted during a heatwave with reduced consciousness. She exhibited dry mucous membranes and widespread, low-amplitude fasciculations. Sodium was 162 mmol/L; slow correction with 5% dextrose led to the resolution of neurological irritability and twitching.

fasciculation_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Miller Fisher Syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Double vision, unsteadiness, and facial twitching
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male presented with acute ataxia and ophthalmoplegia following a diarrhoeal illness. Examination noted absent reflexes and subtle fasciculations in the facial muscles. CSF protein was elevated with a normal cell count (albuminocytologic dissociation), and anti-GQ1b antibodies were positive, confirming the GBS variant.

fasciculation_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute hypocalcaemia post-thyroidectomy
  presenting_complaint: Perioral tingling and muscle spasms
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female, 24 hours post-total thyroidectomy, complained of numbness around her mouth and "jumping" muscles in her arms.

fasciculation_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Chronic denervation secondary to brachial plexus injury
  presenting_complaint: Wasting and twitching of the shoulder muscles
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male presented 6 months after a motorcycle accident with persistent weakness in right shoulder abduction. Examination showed significant atrophy of the deltoid and supraspinatus, with localized fasciculations. EMG confirmed chronic denervation with reinnervation potentials, and he was referred for nerve transfer surgery evaluation.

fasciculation_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Health anxiety-related fasciculation
  presenting_complaint: Intermittent twitching in various muscle groups
  summary_of_course: A 23-year-old medical student presented with widespread fasciculations after reading about motor neurone disease. Physical examination, including cranial nerves, power, and reflexes, was entirely normal. Reassurance and a negative "peace of mind" EMG led to a significant reduction in symptom perception, confirming a psychogenic/anxiety-driven component.
