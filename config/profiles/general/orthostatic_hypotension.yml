orthostatic_hypotension_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent lightheadedness and "coat-hanger" pain in the neck and shoulders upon standing.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male with a 5-year history of Parkinson's disease presented with worsening postural instability. Bedside BP monitoring showed a 35/15 mmHg drop within 3 minutes of standing without a compensatory heart rate increase. He was started on midodrine 5mg TDS and advised on increased salt intake, resulting in significant symptomatic improvement.

orthostatic_hypotension_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Drug-induced orthostatic hypotension
  presenting_complaint: Near-syncope and blurred vision shortly after morning medication.
  summary_of_course: An 85-year-old female with hypertension and heart failure was recently started on furosemide 40mg and doxazosin 2mg. Investigation revealed a postural BP drop of 45/20 mmHg and clinical signs of dehydration. Doxazosin was discontinued and furosemide dose reduced, leading to resolution of symptoms within 48 hours.

orthostatic_hypotension_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute hypovolaemic orthostatic hypotension
  presenting_complaint: Severe dizziness and collapse following 48 hours of profuse diarrhoea.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male athlete presented to A&E with signs of severe dehydration following viral gastroenteritis. Initial BP was 110/70 mmHg supine, falling to 80/50 mmHg on attempting to sit up, accompanied by tachycardia (130 bpm). He was treated with 3L of intravenous Hartmann's solution, which restored haemodynamic stability.

orthostatic_hypotension_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Diabetic autonomic neuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Chronic dizziness on standing and postprandial somnolence.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old female with long-standing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and peripheral neuropathy reported frequent falls. Tilt-table testing confirmed a progressive fall in systolic BP (>30 mmHg) without tachycardia, consistent with autonomic failure. Management included fludrocortisone 100mcg daily and abdominal binders, which reduced fall frequency.

orthostatic_hypotension_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Multiple System Atrophy (MSA-P)
  presenting_complaint: Severe, life-threatening syncope and progressive gait disturbance.
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male presented with recurrent loss of consciousness when walking. Evaluation showed profound neurogenic OH (BP 160/90 supine, 70/40 standing) and parkinsonian features poorly responsive to levodopa. Despite maximal doses of midodrine and fludrocortisone, he required a wheelchair for safety due to refractory hypotension.

orthostatic_hypotension_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Postprandial orthostatic hypotension
  presenting_complaint: Dizziness and lethargy specifically occurring 30-60 minutes after lunch.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male resident in a care home experienced multiple "slumping" episodes in the dining hall. Postprandial BP monitoring showed a 40 mmHg systolic drop after a carbohydrate-heavy meal. Symptoms were managed by switching to smaller, frequent, low-carbohydrate meals and drinking 200ml of cold water before eating.

orthostatic_hypotension_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Addison’s disease (Primary Adrenal Insufficiency)
  presenting_complaint: Fatigue, weight loss, and postural dizziness.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female presented with hyperpigmentation and significant orthostatic hypotension (25 mmHg drop). Laboratory tests revealed hyponatraemia (128 mmol/L), hyperkalaemia (5.6 mmol/L), and a low morning cortisol (80 nmol/L) with a flat Synacthen test. She was commenced on hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone, which fully resolved the orthostatic symptoms.

orthostatic_hypotension_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Pure Autonomic Failure (PAF)
  presenting_complaint: Insidious onset of dizziness on standing and reduced sweating.
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old male presented with a 2-year history of orthostatic intolerance and erectile dysfunction. Investigations showed a persistent 40/20 mmHg postural BP drop and low supine plasma noradrenaline levels. Diagnosis of PAF was made; he was managed with physical counter-manoeuvres and sleeping with the head of the bed elevated to mitigate supine hypertension.

orthostatic_hypotension_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Anaemia-related orthostatic hypotension
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations and feeling faint when rising from bed.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old female with menorrhagia presented with a pale complexion and postural tachycardia/hypotension. Blood tests showed a haemoglobin of 72 g/L and ferritin of 5 ng/mL. Following a blood transfusion and initiation of oral ferrous fumarate, her orthostatic BP response normalised as her haematocrit improved.

orthostatic_hypotension_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Iatrogenic orthostatic hypotension (Alpha-blocker)
  presenting_complaint: Sudden collapse after the first dose of new medication.
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male with benign prostatic hyperplasia was prescribed tamsulosin 400mcg. He experienced a syncopal episode 4 hours after the first dose; A&E assessment confirmed a postural drop of 30 mmHg. The medication was switched to a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, and he remained asymptomatic thereafter.

orthostatic_hypotension_011:
  primary_diagnosis: AL Amyloidosis with autonomic involvement
  presenting_complaint: Progressive orthostatic hypotension and peripheral oedema.
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male with known monoclonal gammopathy presented with severe OH and nephrotic-range proteinuria. Biopsy confirmed AL amyloid deposits in the kidney and skin; autonomic testing showed severe sympathetic denervation. Treatment focused on chemotherapy for the underlying plasma cell dyscrasia and midodrine for symptomatic BP support.

orthostatic_hypotension_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric orthostatic hypotension
  presenting_complaint: Dizziness and blurred vision during school assemblies.
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old female presented with recurrent pre-syncope when standing for long periods. Clinical examination showed a 22 mmHg systolic drop within 5 minutes of standing, without the marked tachycardia seen in POTS. She was successfully managed with increased fluid intake (2.5L/day), increased dietary salt, and avoiding rapid transitions from supine to standing.

orthostatic_hypotension_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Alcohol-induced autonomic neuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Unsteady gait and dizziness when standing up from a chair.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male with chronic alcohol dependence presented with sensory loss in a "stocking-glove" distribution and symptomatic OH. Nerve conduction studies and autonomic function tests confirmed mixed peripheral and autonomic neuropathy. Management included alcohol abstinence, high-dose thiamine, and conservative measures for OH, resulting in partial symptomatic recovery.

orthostatic_hypotension_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute-on-chronic orthostatic hypotension (Sepsis)
  presenting_complaint: Confusion and inability to stand due to profound dizziness.
  summary_of_course: An 88-year-old female with pre-existing mild OH became acutely unwell with a urinary tract infection. Her baseline postural drop of 15 mmHg worsened to 50 mmHg systolic in the setting of sepsis-induced vasodilation. She required hospital admission for IV antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation to restore her baseline haemodynamic status.

orthostatic_hypotension_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Spinal cord injury-related orthostatic hypotension
  presenting_complaint: Severe dizziness during mobilisation in a rehabilitation unit.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male with a recent T4 complete spinal cord injury experienced syncope whenever tilted beyond 30 degrees. This was attributed to loss of sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone below the level of the lesion. He was treated with an abdominal binder, compression stockings, and gradual tilt-table conditioning over several weeks.

orthostatic_hypotension_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Post-viral orthostatic hypotension
  presenting_complaint: Persistent orthostatic intolerance following a severe respiratory infection.
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old female reported ongoing dizziness and "brain fog" 3 months after a severe bout of COVID-19. Assessment revealed a 25/10 mmHg drop in BP upon standing, which was not present prior to her illness. She was diagnosed with post-viral dysautonomia and showed gradual improvement with a structured exercise programme and increased salt intake.

orthostatic_hypotension_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Orthostatic hypotension secondary to deconditioning
  presenting_complaint: Dizziness and weakness when first mobilising after prolonged ICU stay.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male spent 4 weeks in ICU for pneumonia and required mechanical ventilation. Upon step-down, he experienced significant OH (30 mmHg drop) during initial physiotherapy sessions. This was managed with gradual re-mobilisation, lower limb exercises in bed, and ensuring adequate hydration, with symptoms resolving over 2 weeks.

orthostatic_hypotension_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Dialysis-associated orthostatic hypotension
  presenting_complaint: Post-dialysis syncope and severe cramping.
  summary_of_course: A 67-year-old male on haemodialysis for ESRD frequently collapsed after his sessions. Evaluation showed a post-dialysis BP drop of 50 mmHg systolic, likely due to rapid fluid removal in the context of diabetic autonomic dysfunction. Adjustments to the ultrafiltration rate and midodrine 2.5mg prior to dialysis sessions improved his stability.

orthostatic_hypotension_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Paraneoplastic autonomic neuropathy
  presenting_complaint: Subacute onset of severe orthostatic hypotension and dry mouth.
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old female smoker presented with a 3-week history of rapidly progressive OH and constipation. CT thorax revealed a suspicious lung mass, and biopsy confirmed small cell lung cancer. Anti-Hu antibodies were positive, indicating a paraneoplastic autonomic neuropathy; OH was managed with pyridostigmine and oncology-directed therapy.

orthostatic_hypotension_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Orthostatic hypotension with supine hypertension
  presenting_complaint: Night-time headaches and daytime dizziness.
  summary_of_course: A 75-year-old male with neurogenic OH was found to have a standing BP of 85/55 mmHg but a supine BP of 190/110 mmHg. This "supine hypertension-orthostatic hypotension" syndrome made treatment challenging. He was advised to avoid lying flat during the day, used a 20-degree head-of-bed elevation at night, and was prescribed short-acting midodrine only during active morning hours.
