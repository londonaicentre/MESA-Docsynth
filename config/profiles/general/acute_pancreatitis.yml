acute_pancreatitis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute pancreatitis in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Severe epigastric pain at 34 weeks gestation
  summary_of_course: A 32-year-old pregnant female presented with gallstone pancreatitis. Management was challenging due to the third-trimester pregnancy; she was treated conservatively with IV fluids and pethidine. Following a healthy delivery at 38 weeks, she underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the early postpartum period.

acute_pancreatitis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Infected pancreatic necrosis
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent fever and worsening pain 3 weeks after admission
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old male with previous severe pancreatitis developed new fevers and a rising leucocytosis. CT-guided fine-needle aspiration confirmed the presence of E. coli within the necrotic collection. He was managed with a "step-up" approach, involving percutaneous drainage and targeted intravenous antibiotics, avoiding the need for open necrosectomy.

acute_pancreatitis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation
  presenting_complaint: Persistent fullness and early satiety post-pancreatitis
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male presented four weeks after a mild episode of pancreatitis with a palpable epigastric mass. Ultrasound and MRI confirmed an 8cm pancreatic pseudocyst. As he remained symptomatic, he underwent successful endoscopic ultrasound-guided cystogastrostomy with stent placement.
