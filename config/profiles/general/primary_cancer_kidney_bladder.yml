  primary_diagnosis: Transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder
  presenting_complaint: Painless macroscopic haematuria
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male smoker presented with three episodes of bright red blood in his urine. Urgent flexible cystoscopy revealed a papillary lesion on the lateral bladder wall. He underwent a transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT), which confirmed pT1 Grade 3 transitional cell carcinoma, and was started on a course of intravesical BCG.

primary_cancer_kidney_bladder_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding on abdominal ultrasound
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old female underwent an ultrasound for suspected gallstones, which incidentally identified a 3.5cm solid mass on the lower pole of the left kidney. Contrast-enhanced CT confirmed a Bosniak category IV lesion suspicious for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). She underwent a successful robot-assisted partial nephrectomy with histology confirming clear cell RCC, Fuhrman grade 2.

primary_cancer_kidney_bladder_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Nephroblastoma (Wilms tumour)
  presenting_complaint: Palpable abdominal mass and malaise
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old boy was brought to the paediatric assessment unit after his mother noticed a firm, non-tender lump in his right abdomen. Imaging revealed a large intra-renal mass displacing the collecting system, consistent with a Wilms tumour. He commenced neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by a radical nephrectomy, with no evidence of metastatic disease on chest CT.

primary_cancer_kidney_bladder_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Metastatic renal cell carcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Severe hypercalcaemia, confusion, and bone pain
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male was admitted via A&E with acute confusion and a corrected calcium of 3.45 mmol/L. Imaging identified a 12cm right renal mass with extensive lytic bone metastases in the lumbar spine and pelvis. He was stabilised with intravenous fluids and bisphosphonates before commencing systemic immunotherapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab.

primary_cancer_kidney_bladder_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder
  presenting_complaint: Chronic dysuria and recurrent urinary tract infections
  summary_of_course: A 58-year-old female with a history of long-term catheterisation due to spinal cord injury presented with worsening pelvic pain and persistent pyuria. Cystoscopy and biopsy revealed a keratinising squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder, likely secondary to chronic irritation. Given the muscle-invasive nature (T3a), she underwent a radical cystectomy and ileal conduit formation.

primary_cancer_kidney_bladder_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis
  presenting_complaint: Loin pain and microscopic haematuria
  summary_of_course: A 65-year-old male presented with persistent dull aching in the left flank. A CT urogram demonstrated a filling defect in the left renal pelvis causing moderate hydronephrosis. Ureteroscopy and biopsy confirmed high-grade transitional cell carcinoma (TCC), and he subsequently underwent a laparoscopic radical nephroureterectomy with a bladder cuff excision.

primary_cancer_kidney_bladder_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC)
  presenting_complaint: Clot retention and lower abdominal pain
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including heart failure and COPD, presented with acute urinary retention due to blood clots. Investigation revealed a large, necrotic bladder tumour invading the detrusor muscle (T2). Due to his frailty, he was not a candidate for radical surgery and was instead managed with palliative radiotherapy and intermittent catheterisation.

primary_cancer_kidney_bladder_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Asymptomatic incidental finding
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old female with Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome underwent screening renal MRI, which identified a 2cm enhancing mass in the right kidney. Due to the slow growth rate and the patient's genetic predisposition, she was initially managed with active surveillance. Subsequent growth led to a cryoablation procedure, with histology from the biopsy confirming chromophobe RCC.

primary_cancer_kidney_bladder_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Renal cell carcinoma with IVC thrombus
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral leg oedema and right-sided flank pain
  summary_of_course: A 70-year-old male presented with new-onset lower limb swelling and a palpable right loin mass. CT imaging showed a 10cm renal tumour with a Level III tumour thrombus extending into the inferior vena cava (IVC) above the hepatic veins. He underwent a complex radical nephrectomy and IVC thrombectomy involving a multidisciplinary surgical team.

primary_cancer_kidney_bladder_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Papillary renal cell carcinoma (Type 1)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent anaemia and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 63-year-old female presented to her GP with lethargy and unintentional weight loss of 10kg over six months. Blood tests showed a microcytic anaemia and raised inflammatory markers. A CT scan identified a 6cm hypo-enhancing mass in the left kidney, which was confirmed as Type 1 papillary RCC following a radical nephrectomy.

primary_cancer_kidney_bladder_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Urachal adenocarcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Mucus in the urine (mucusuria)
  summary_of_course: A 39-year-old male reported passing "jelly-like" material in his urine for several weeks. Cystoscopy revealed a tumour at the dome of the bladder, and further imaging showed a midline mass extending towards the umbilicus. He was diagnosed with a urachal adenocarcinoma and underwent a partial cystectomy with en bloc resection of the urachus and umbilicus.

primary_cancer_kidney_bladder_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Renal medullary carcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Acute flank pain and haematuria
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male with known sickle cell trait presented with rapid-onset left flank pain. Imaging showed an infiltrative mass in the renal medulla with associated lymphadenopathy. Biopsy confirmed renal medullary carcinoma, a highly aggressive tumour; despite intensive chemotherapy, the disease progressed rapidly within four months.

primary_cancer_kidney_bladder_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Collecting duct carcinoma of the kidney
  presenting_complaint: Gross haematuria and night sweats
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old male presented with systemic symptoms and visible blood in his urine. CT imaging showed a centrally located renal mass involving the medulla and collecting system. Histopathology following nephrectomy revealed collecting duct carcinoma, an uncommon and aggressive subtype, necessitating adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy.

primary_cancer_kidney_bladder_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly enlarging abdominal girth and pain
  summary_of_course: A 69-year-old female presented with a three-week history of increasing abdominal pain and a palpable mass. Imaging revealed a 15cm heterogeneous renal mass with features suggesting sarcomatoid transformation. Despite a radical nephrectomy, she developed early local recurrence and lung metastases within three months of surgery.

primary_cancer_kidney_bladder_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Bladder carcinoma in situ (CIS)
  presenting_complaint: Refractory "interstitial cystitis" symptoms
  summary_of_course: A 61-year-old female was treated for two years for presumed interstitial cystitis due to persistent frequency, urgency, and suprapubic pain. Following a lack of response to standard therapies, a biopsy under anaesthesia revealed widespread high-grade carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the bladder. She was treated with intravesical BCG, showing a complete response at the six-month follow-up cystoscopy.

primary_cancer_kidney_bladder_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Renal cell carcinoma presenting as Wunderlich syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset flank pain and haemorrhagic shock
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old male was brought to the emergency department with acute, severe left-sided pain and hypotension. An urgent CT scan showed a large spontaneous subcapsular and perirenal haemorrhage originating from a previously unknown 5cm renal mass. After emergency embolisation to stabilise his condition, he later underwent a delayed radical nephrectomy for clear cell RCC.

primary_cancer_kidney_bladder_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC)
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent microscopic haematuria
  summary_of_course: A 74-year-old male smoker was referred via the two-week wait pathway for persistent microscopic haematuria found during a routine health check. Cystoscopy identified multiple small, friable lesions, which were resected and confirmed as pTa Grade 2 (low grade) TCC. He was placed on a long-term surveillance programme with regular check cystoscopies.

primary_cancer_kidney_bladder_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Renal cell carcinoma with paraneoplastic polycythaemia
  presenting_complaint: Headache, dizziness, and facial flushing
  summary_of_course: A 66-year-old male presented with symptoms of hyperviscosity and a haemoglobin of 205 g/L. Investigations for polycythaemia rubra vera were negative, but an abdominal CT revealed a 7cm vascular right renal mass. Following a radical nephrectomy, his erythropoietin levels and haemoglobin normalised, confirming a paraneoplastic syndrome secondary to RCC.

primary_cancer_kidney_bladder_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Small cell carcinoma of the bladder
  presenting_complaint: Rapidly worsening urinary symptoms and weight loss
  summary_of_course: A 64-year-old male presented with a short history of severe dysuria and 8kg weight loss. Biopsy of a large bladder mass revealed a rare small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. He was treated with a combination of systemic chemotherapy (etoposide and cisplatin) followed by consolidative radiotherapy, as the disease was considered too aggressive for primary surgery.

primary_cancer_kidney_bladder_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Bilateral synchronous renal cell carcinoma
  presenting_complaint: Incidental findings on CT for diverticulitis
  summary_of_course: A 59-year-old female underwent a CT scan for acute diverticulitis, which revealed suspicious masses in both kidneys (2cm on the left, 3cm on the right). Genetic screening for Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome was negative. She underwent staged bilateral partial nephrectomies to preserve renal function, with histology confirming clear cell RCC in both specimens.
