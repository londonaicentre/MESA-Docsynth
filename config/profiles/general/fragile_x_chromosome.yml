fragile_x_chromosome_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Fragile X syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Developmental delay and hyperactive behaviour
  summary_of_course: A 4-year-old male presented with significant speech delay and poor eye contact. Physical examination revealed a long facial profile and prominent ears. Genetic testing confirmed an FMR1 full mutation (>200 CGG repeats), leading to a diagnosis of Fragile X syndrome. He was referred to paediatric speech and language therapy and educational psychology for a coordinated support plan.

fragile_x_chromosome_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS)
  presenting_complaint: Progressive intention tremor and gait instability
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old male presented with a three-year history of worsening hand tremors and frequent falls. Brain MRI demonstrated T2-weighted hyperintensities in the middle cerebellar peduncles (MCP sign). Molecular testing identified an FMR1 premutation (85 CGG repeats), confirming FXTAS. Management focused on symptomatic relief of tremors and physiotherapy for balance.

fragile_x_chromosome_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI)
  presenting_complaint: Secondary amenorrhoea and infertility
  summary_of_course: A 31-year-old female presented with a 12-month history of absent menses and difficulty conceiving. Laboratory investigations showed elevated FSH levels (45 IU/L) and low oestradiol, consistent with premature ovarian failure. Genetic screening revealed she was a carrier of an FMR1 premutation (110 CGG repeats). She was counselled regarding her reproductive options and the risk of Fragile X syndrome in future offspring.

fragile_x_chromosome_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Fragile X syndrome (severe)
  presenting_complaint: Global developmental delay and infantile hypotonia
  summary_of_course: An 18-month-old male was referred for failure to meet motor milestones and generalised low muscle tone. Clinical assessment noted macrocephaly and a high-arched palate. Southern blot analysis confirmed a full FMR1 mutation with complete methylation. He requires intensive multi-disciplinary input including occupational therapy and paediatric neurology for seizure monitoring.

fragile_x_chromosome_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Fragile X syndrome
  presenting_complaint: Social anxiety and learning difficulties
  summary_of_course: A 14-year-old male, previously diagnosed with ADHD, presented with increasing social withdrawal and tactile defensiveness. Physical examination noted post-pubertal macroorchidism and joint hypermobility. Genetic re-evaluation confirmed Fragile X syndrome. His medication was adjusted from stimulants to SSRIs to better manage his anxiety symptoms.

fragile_x_chromosome_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Fragile X syndrome in a female
  presenting_complaint: Mild intellectual disability and emotional lability
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old female presented to the community mental health team with chronic anxiety and difficulties maintaining employment. Neuropsychological testing revealed a borderline IQ and executive function deficits. Genetic testing showed a full FMR1 mutation with skewed X-inactivation, explaining her milder phenotype compared to affected males. She was provided with vocational support and CBT.

fragile_x_chromosome_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Fragile X syndrome with comorbid Autism Spectrum Disorder
  presenting_complaint: Repetitive behaviours and hand-flapping
  summary_of_course: A 3-year-old male was brought to the paediatrician for suspected autism due to delayed language and stereotypic movements. Genetic screening as part of the ASD diagnostic pathway identified >300 CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene. He was started on an intensive behavioural intervention programme and speech therapy.

fragile_x_chromosome_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS)
  presenting_complaint: Cognitive decline and parkinsonism
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old male was initially treated for Parkinson's disease with levodopa, but showed no clinical improvement. His family history was significant for a grandson with unexplained learning disabilities. Subsequent genetic testing confirmed an FMR1 premutation. His diagnosis was revised to FXTAS, and management shifted to supportive care and cognitive rehabilitation.

fragile_x_chromosome_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Fragile X syndrome (neonatal diagnosis)
  presenting_complaint: Positive family history
  summary_of_course: A newborn male underwent genetic testing shortly after birth due to a known maternal FMR1 carrier status. Cord blood analysis confirmed a full mutation (>200 repeats). While currently asymptomatic, he was enrolled in an early surveillance programme to monitor for developmental delays and provide timely intervention.

fragile_x_chromosome_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Fragile X syndrome with acute seizures
  presenting_complaint: Tonic-clonic seizure
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old male with known Fragile X syndrome was admitted to the paediatric emergency department following a five-minute generalised seizure. EEG showed focal spikes in the centrotemporal region. He was commenced on levetiracetam, which successfully controlled further seizure activity, and he was discharged to outpatient neurology follow-up.

fragile_x_chromosome_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Fragile X syndrome with mitral valve prolapse
  presenting_complaint: Palpitations and chest discomfort
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male with Fragile X syndrome presented to the cardiology clinic with intermittent palpitations. Echocardiography revealed mild mitral valve prolapse with trace regurgitation, likely related to underlying connective tissue dysplasia. He was advised on regular cardiac monitoring and antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures was discussed.

fragile_x_chromosome_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Fragile X syndrome (severe behavioural phenotype)
  presenting_complaint: Aggression and self-injurious behaviour
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old male with severe intellectual disability due to Fragile X lived in a residential care facility. He presented with an acute escalation of head-banging and aggression towards staff. Following a medical review to rule out pain (e.g., dental abscess), his dose of risperidone was titrated, and a functional behavioural assessment was conducted to modify his environment.

fragile_x_chromosome_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Fragile X mosaicism
  presenting_complaint: Borderline learning difficulties and unusual facial features
  summary_of_course: A 10-year-old male presented with mild academic struggles but lacked the classic Fragile X phenotype. Initial PCR testing was inconclusive, but Southern blot analysis revealed mosaicism (a mix of premutation and full mutation alleles). This explained his relatively high cognitive functioning compared to his fully mutated brother. He receives targeted educational support in a mainstream school.

fragile_x_chromosome_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Fragile X syndrome with recurrent otitis media
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent ear infections and conductive hearing loss
  summary_of_course: A 5-year-old male with Fragile X syndrome was referred to ENT for persistent glue ear. He had suffered five episodes of acute otitis media in the preceding year, further complicating his speech delay. He underwent bilateral grommet insertion, which significantly improved his hearing thresholds and aided his speech and language development.

fragile_x_chromosome_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Fragile X syndrome with severe scoliosis
  presenting_complaint: Progressive spinal curvature and back pain
  summary_of_course: A 16-year-old male with Fragile X syndrome was noted to have a significant rib hump during a routine check-up. Spinal X-rays confirmed a thoracolumbar scoliosis with a Cobb angle of 48 degrees. Due to the severity and potential for respiratory compromise, he was referred for spinal fusion surgery, which was completed without complications.

fragile_x_chromosome_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Fragile X syndrome with aspiration pneumonia
  presenting_complaint: Fever, cough, and increased secretions
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male with severe Fragile X syndrome and associated dysphagia was admitted to the hospital with acute respiratory distress. Chest X-ray confirmed right lower lobe pneumonia. He was treated with IV antibiotics and chest physiotherapy; a subsequent videofluoroscopy led to the recommendation of thickened fluids and a soft diet to prevent further aspiration.

fragile_x_chromosome_017:
  primary_diagnosis: FMR1 premutation-associated psychiatric symptoms
  presenting_complaint: Chronic depression and panic attacks
  summary_of_course: A 38-year-old female, known to be an FMR1 premutation carrier, presented with worsening psychiatric symptoms refractory to standard primary care management. Neuropsychiatric evaluation suggested her symptoms were part of the premutation carrier phenotype rather than isolated major depressive disorder. Her treatment was optimised with a combination of venlafaxine and specialist psychological support.

fragile_x_chromosome_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Fragile X syndrome with refractory epilepsy
  presenting_complaint: Multiple daily focal seizures
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old male with Fragile X syndrome experienced frequent seizures despite trials of carbamazepine and sodium valproate. He was admitted for video-EEG monitoring, which confirmed multi-focal epileptiform discharges. His regimen was adjusted to include lamotrigine and a ketogenic diet, which resulted in a 50% reduction in seizure frequency.

fragile_x_chromosome_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Fragile X syndrome with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)
  presenting_complaint: Loud snoring and daytime somnolence
  summary_of_course: A 7-year-old male with Fragile X syndrome and characteristic mid-face hypoplasia presented with sleep disturbances. Polysomnography confirmed moderate OSA with an AHI of 15. He underwent an adenotonsillectomy, which significantly improved his sleep quality and daytime focus, as reported by his school teachers.

fragile_x_chromosome_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Fragile X syndrome with recurrent inguinal hernia
  presenting_complaint: Groin swelling and discomfort
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old male with Fragile X syndrome presented with a recurrent right inguinal hernia, having had a previous repair in childhood. The recurrence was attributed to the connective tissue abnormalities common in FMR1 mutations. He underwent a tension-free mesh repair under general anaesthetic and made an uncomplicated recovery with specific instructions for avoiding heavy lifting.
