urolithiasis_001:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute ureteric colic
  presenting_complaint: Sudden onset severe left loin-to-groin pain and nausea.
  summary_of_course: A 34-year-old male presented to A&E with paroxysmal 10/10 pain and microscopic haematuria. CT KUB confirmed a 4mm calculus in the distal left ureter with no hydronephrosis. He was managed conservatively with tamsulosin and NSAIDs, successfully passing the stone 48 hours later.

urolithiasis_002:
  primary_diagnosis: Obstructive uropathy with urosepsis
  presenting_complaint: Rigors, confusion, and right-sided flank tenderness.
  summary_of_course: A 72-year-old female with type 2 diabetes presented with septic shock and a CRP of 250. CT KUB revealed a 12mm stone obstructing the right pelviureteric junction with associated pyonephrosis. She underwent emergency percutaneous nephrostomy and stayed in ICU for 72 hours for inotropic support and IV antibiotics.

urolithiasis_003:
  primary_diagnosis: Paediatric cystinuria
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent urinary tract infections and abdominal discomfort.
  summary_of_course: An 8-year-old boy with a family history of renal stones presented with persistent dysuria. Ultrasound showed bilateral renal calculi, and a 24-hour urine collection confirmed high cystine levels. He was started on high fluid intake and urinary alkalinisation with potassium citrate to prevent recurrence.

urolithiasis_004:
  primary_diagnosis: Asymptomatic nephrolithiasis
  presenting_complaint: Incidental finding on abdominal imaging.
  summary_of_course: A 55-year-old female underwent a CT abdomen for investigation of diverticulitis, which incidentally showed a 6mm non-obstructing stone in the lower pole of the right kidney. As she was asymptomatic with normal renal function, a "watch and wait" approach with annual ultrasound surveillance was agreed upon.

urolithiasis_005:
  primary_diagnosis: Urolithiasis in pregnancy
  presenting_complaint: Right-sided pleuritic-type chest pain and flank ache at 24 weeks gestation.
  summary_of_course: A 28-year-old pregnant woman presented with suspected pulmonary embolism, but CTPA was negative. Subsequent renal tract ultrasound demonstrated moderate right hydronephrosis and a 5mm mid-ureteric stone. Due to persistent pain, a temporary JJ stent was inserted under local anaesthetic until postpartum definitive treatment.

urolithiasis_006:
  primary_diagnosis: Acute kidney injury secondary to obstructive uropathy
  presenting_complaint: Anuria for 18 hours and generalised malaise.
  summary_of_course: A 62-year-old male with a solitary left kidney (previous right nephrectomy for RCC) presented with a creatinine of 550 µmol/L. CT KUB showed a 7mm stone at the left vesicoureteric junction. Emergency ureteroscopy and laser lithotripsy were performed, resulting in immediate diuresis and recovery of renal function.

urolithiasis_007:
  primary_diagnosis: Ureteric stricture post-ureteroscopy
  presenting_complaint: Persistent dull ache in the left flank six months after stone surgery.
  summary_of_course: A 45-year-old male who previously underwent complex ureteroscopy for a large proximal stone presented with worsening hydronephrosis on follow-up ultrasound. An isotope renogram (MAG3) confirmed a functional obstruction, and a retrograde pyelogram identified a 1cm ureteric stricture at the previous stone site, requiring ureteric reconstruction.

urolithiasis_008:
  primary_diagnosis: Referred scrotal pain due to urolithiasis
  presenting_complaint: Acute right testicular pain and lower abdominal discomfort.
  summary_of_course: A 22-year-old male was initially triaged for suspected testicular torsion, but physical examination and Doppler ultrasound were normal. CT KUB revealed a 3mm stone in the mid-ureter at the level where it crosses the iliac vessels. The pain resolved spontaneously following hydration and alpha-blocker therapy.

urolithiasis_009:
  primary_diagnosis: Staghorn calculus
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent haematuria and persistent dull flank pain.
  summary_of_course: An 80-year-old male with chronic catheterisation presented with macroscopic haematuria. A plain KUB X-ray showed a large branched opacity filling the entire left renal pelvis and calyces (Staghorn stone). Given his frailty and multiple comorbidities, he was managed conservatively with long-term prophylactic antibiotics.

urolithiasis_010:
  primary_diagnosis: Failed extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL)
  presenting_complaint: Persistent 15mm lower pole renal stone.
  summary_of_course: A 50-year-old female underwent two sessions of ESWL for a symptomatic lower pole stone, but follow-up imaging showed no fragmentation. Analysis of a previously passed fragment suggested a high-density calcium oxalate monohydrate composition. She was subsequently successfully treated via percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL).

urolithiasis_011:
  primary_diagnosis: Uric acid urolithiasis
  presenting_complaint: Passage of "orange sand" in urine and recurrent colic.
  summary_of_course: A 60-year-old male with gout and metabolic syndrome presented with recurrent radiolucent stones (visible on CT but not X-ray). Urine pH was consistently low at 5.0. He was treated with medical dissolution therapy using potassium citrate and allopurinol, resulting in complete resolution of the stones on follow-up CT.

urolithiasis_012:
  primary_diagnosis: Pyonephrosis
  presenting_complaint: High fever, flank pain, and pyuria.
  summary_of_course: A 68-year-old female presented with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Ultrasound showed "snowstorm" debris within a dilated renal collecting system obstructed by a 9mm stone. She underwent emergency ultrasound-guided drainage of frank pus via nephrostomy and received a 2-week course of targeted IV antibiotics.

urolithiasis_013:
  primary_diagnosis: Hypercalciuria-related urolithiasis
  presenting_complaint: Frequent passage of small stones (3-4 times per year).
  summary_of_course: A 40-year-old male with recurrent calcium oxalate stones underwent a metabolic screen. Results showed significant hypercalciuria (12 mmol/24h) despite a normal serum calcium. He was advised on a low-salt diet and started on a thiazide diuretic (indapamide), which successfully reduced his stone formation rate over the following two years.

urolithiasis_014:
  primary_diagnosis: Giant bladder calculus
  presenting_complaint: Supra-pubic pain, frequency, and intermittent urinary stream.
  summary_of_course: A 35-year-old male with a T10 spinal cord injury and long-term suprapubic catheter presented with recurrent blockages. A pelvic X-ray revealed a 4cm laminated bladder stone. He underwent an open cystolithotomy as the stone was too large and hard for endoscopic cystolitholapaxy.

urolithiasis_015:
  primary_diagnosis: Distal renal tubular acidosis (Type 1 RTA)
  presenting_complaint: Bilateral nephrocalcinosis and growth retardation.
  summary_of_course: A 12-year-old girl was referred to paediatrics due to short stature and incidental findings of dense renal calcifications on abdominal X-ray. Investigations revealed hypokalaemia, hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis, and an inability to acidify urine below pH 6.0. She was diagnosed with distal RTA and started on bicarbonate supplementation to prevent further stone formation.

urolithiasis_016:
  primary_diagnosis: Bilateral ureteric obstruction
  presenting_complaint: Sudden cessation of urine output and lower back pain.
  summary_of_course: A 48-year-old female presented with anuria for 24 hours and uraemic symptoms. CT KUB demonstrated bilateral 6mm ureteric stones at the pelvic brim. She required emergency bilateral retrograde JJ stent insertion, which led to a massive post-obstructive diuresis of 6 litres in the first 12 hours.

urolithiasis_017:
  primary_diagnosis: Subacute obstructive uropathy
  presenting_complaint: Chronic, nagging right-sided back pain for three months.
  summary_of_course: A 52-year-old male presented with persistent discomfort that was previously dismissed as musculoskeletal. Ultrasound revealed severe hydronephrosis and a thinned renal cortex. A 10mm stone was found in the proximal ureter; despite successful laser lithotripsy, an isotope scan showed only 15% residual function in the affected kidney.

urolithiasis_018:
  primary_diagnosis: Medullary sponge kidney
  presenting_complaint: Recurrent UTIs and microscopic haematuria.
  summary_of_course: A 30-year-old female with a history of multiple stone episodes since her teens underwent a CT urogram. The imaging showed a classic "bouquet of flowers" appearance due to ectatic collecting ducts and papillary calcifications. She was managed with increased fluid intake and regular monitoring of her renal function.

urolithiasis_019:
  primary_diagnosis: Steinstrasse (Stone Street)
  presenting_complaint: Severe colic following shockwave lithotripsy.
  summary_of_course: A 44-year-old male underwent ESWL for a 20mm renal stone. Two days later, he returned with intractable pain and vomiting. A plain KUB film showed a column of fragmented stone material (Steinstrasse) obstructing the distal ureter. He required urgent ureteroscopic clearance of the fragments and a temporary stent.

urolithiasis_020:
  primary_diagnosis: Urolithiasis mimicking acute appendicitis
  presenting_complaint: Right iliac fossa pain, guarding, and low-grade fever.
  summary_of_course: A 19-year-old male was referred for suspected appendicitis. However, urinalysis showed 3+ blood and no leucocytes. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a normal appendix but a 3mm stone lodged at the right vesicoureteric junction, causing referred pain to the right iliac fossa. He was managed conservatively.
